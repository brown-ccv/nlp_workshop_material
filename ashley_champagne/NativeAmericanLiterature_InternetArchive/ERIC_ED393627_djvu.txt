Dear Colleague: 

Re: NATIVE EDUCATION BiBLIOGRAPHY - FOURTH EDITION 

The first three editions of our publication "Native Library Resources For 
Elementary, Junior and Senior High Schools' were very well received and, we 
believe, have led to an increase in the quality and quantity of learning 
resources available for Native Education. 

We are happy to announce a new fourth edition of this Bibliography and to 
inform you of the changes we have made in response to your comments. This fourth 
edition is presented in much the same format as the previous edition and makes 
the Bibliography easy to use. We have divided the content into materials for 
Division I and II and materials for Division' III and IV. We have also added a 
significant number of audiovisual resources and these are identified in a 
separate section. All of the resources have been evaluated carefully under our 
Native Content Analysis procedure by a team of practising Native teachers. You 
may have confidence in ordering them for your students. 

Because of the increasing interest in Native Education in all parts of 
Canada, there is a continuing influx of new material. We evaluated the materials 
during 1991 and included them in this edition. We also deleted those resources 
that were out of print. 

Thank you for your continued interest in this important project. I look 
forward to your feedback. 



March 1, 1992 



Sincerely yours. 




Merv Kowalchuk 
Director

As Billy goes through tire days, he has the feeling that something is 
missing. He has trouble understanding these feelings. As he travels to

DESCRIPTION: Hard cover, full col. illus. and photos, 144 pages 

ANNOTATION: "Legacy: Indian Treaty Relationships’ explores and uncovers the changing 

nature of the relationships between Indian peoples and the larger Canadian 
populace. 

Richard Price examines the historical development and the contemporary

inter-related sections, takes an even handed approach to the perspective of 
the Indian peoples and the views of the federal/provincial governments and 
other interested parties.

need to be understood by all Canadians.

thinking skills. The text suggests problem-solving exercises and asks

reader gains insight into the culture and lifestyle of a particular group 
of people of the period 1850-1875. The booklet depicts how activities and 
events were positively influenced by their European and Indian ancestry: 
e.g., buffalo hunts, methods of preparing and storing food, respect shown 
for eiders, concept of sharing, strong kinship ties, religious belief and 
the distribution of work within the community. The material would teach 
critical thinking skills. Metis settlements would have the opportunity to 
study and research their own culture.

ANNOTATION: Half of each page has a picture in the vibrant colours and unique art 
style of the author-illustrator, showing scenes, objects and activities of 
the North. Beside each, in large simple printing, is a letter of the 

alphabet, both capital and small letter, followed by a sentence. Each 

picture contains objects beginning with the same letter to tempt the 
reader-viewer to search for them. The book challenges perception skills, 
as well as encouraging language development and a knowledge of the North. 
There is a caution about the reading level of this book. While the 

pictures are large and colourful and the main text is easy to read, there 
is a smaller supplementary text that lists the names of communities that 

begin with the letter being illustrated. It is this text that requires a 

much more advanced level of reading. This does not detract from tbe 

usefulness of the book at lower grades.

ANNOTATION: York presents a realistic and well researched document In spite of the 
problems he cites, he is optimistic about the future. He shows how the 
various Native cultures go within themselves to seek solutions to their 
problems. The Natives of Shama Hawa suffered displacement because they did 
not want to be separated from their children. Their traditional means of 

support was curtailed by international events. The Natives of Hobbema 

happened to have oil under their fishing area and came into sudden wealth. 
In both cases, as with others cited, the cause of the problem was beyond 
their control. How to cope had to come from within the tribe.

ANNOTATION: The Modoc* is a part of the ’Indians of the North America Series*. There 
is an excellent introductory essay which states the reason for the series. 
The content in this book lives up to the editor's claims in the essay. The 
Modoc, originally from Oregon and California, were partially removed to 
Indian Territory (now Oklahoma) in 1857. This was after a fierce struggle 
to gain what they thought was justifiably theirs. Following their forced 
removal, the Modoc proceeded to establish themselves in their new home. 
Today, although only a few remain, they have maintained strong pride.

This work of historical fiction on Native/European relations in Canada

for fish, fur, exploration, and evangelization. The relationship developed 
through mutual needs, marriage, and economic partnerships. One of the most 
negative effects of contact was disease. Today, Aboriginal people are 
re-emerging as a strong force in Canadian life.

ANNOTATION: This book is devoted to the question, "What Is the meaning of the Alberta 
Indian treaties?" The Indian Association of Alberta is making available 
years of research work in this unique collection of articles and interviews 
with Indian elders. Indian people and governments have conflicting 
perceptions of these treaties; not only are these perspectives at the root 
of many contemporary Indian government problems and misunderstandings, but 
their basis resides in the Indian treaty negotiations of the last century. 
"The Spirit of the Alberta Indian Treaties" illustrates how in fact 
government and Indian leaders tend to operate within two different systems 
of knowledge and perceptions of reality regarding basic "treaty rights" 
issues.

This book is a comprehensive discussion of the meanings of the images

prototypical of a Haida wintering camp, the authors have used information 
presented by a descendant of a Koona leader to explain the 27 totem poles 
found at Koona. There is a balance of text and photographs or 
illustrations. The latter are needed to give a true appreciation for the 
intricate and symbolic presentations made on the totem poles. The authors 
have also shown a real concern about the loss due to natural deterioration 
and theft of many B.C. totem poles. To them, these totem poles represent a 
part of B.C. history.

It is also the saga of northern Native people being pulled into today's 
world. A rebellious 17-year-old city boy, Jonathan, is being sent by his 
mother to an isolated Arctic settlement on Bufftilo island. He's separated 
from everything he has known and his one true passion - music and the 
leadership of a small jazz group. His new challenge is the harsh reality 
of an environment where respect for the land and other people can mean the 
difference between life and death.

DESCRIPTION: 



Strater Crowfoot, a Blackfoot Indian from Southern Alberta, recalls his 
life and educational struggles. Because of difficulties at home, 
Strater's mother sent him to live in a foster home. While he was still 
young he did poorly in school but determination and hard work led to 
academic achievements. Strater tells of the many difficulties he 
encountered in his search for self-identity and how he has learned to 
bridge the gap between his Native heritage and the non-Native society. 
This is a good example of how a Native person deals with cultural 
conflict; Strater presents a positive role model for both Native and 
non-Native students. May be used in a comparative study with two other 
filmstrips based on similar portrayals. Students also could discuss this 
topic further and compare Strater's experiences with struggles of their 
own.
