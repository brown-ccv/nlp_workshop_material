The Saga of the Greenlanders is one of the two important thirteenth-century accounts of 
the Norse explorations of Greenland and North America, along with the Saga of Erik the

Red. The two accounts describe many of the same events leading to Norse contact with

the North American coastline almost five hundred years before Columbus, but

contradict each other in a number of mysterious and fascinating ways. Containing less
