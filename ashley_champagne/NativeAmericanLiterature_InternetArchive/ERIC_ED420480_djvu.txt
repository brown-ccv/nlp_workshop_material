The Bureau of Indian Affairs developed language and literacy 
standards for schools serving American Indian students, based on the draft

Teachers of English. Standards for grades K-4 list abilities and knowledge 
that Indian students should have by the end of the fourth grade with regard 
to listening and speaking skills in English and a Native language, reading 
ability and strategies, locating information, familiarity with children’s 
literature with Indian themes, understanding the significance of Indian 
languages, writing skills, and knowledge of historic forms of Native writing 
and record keeping. Standards for grades 5-12 list areas in which American 
Indian students should show growth and increasing sophistication, including 
English and Native language literacies, oral and written communication 
skills, critical awareness of various perspectives in oral communication and 
historical and fictional literature, literature appreciation, knowledge of 
language origins and structure, use of technological forms of communication, 
creative writing, use of multiple information resources, and application of 
Native language and experience in school learning. (SV)
