ABSTRACT 

Lessons for students are presented in this handbook 
which covers library and media skills for grades K-9 using 
information about Native Americans and Eskimos as its theme. Skills 
.T.its introduce the use of four types of dictionaries (beginning, 
subject, biographical, and geographical), tables of contents, 
Encyclopedias, almanacs, and biographical indexes. Each unit includes 
objectives, materials needed, procedures for teaching, grade levels 
appropriate for the learning activities, student worksheets, and 
answers to worksheet questions. Objectives are correlated with the 
Montgomery* County Public Schools curriculum and with two 
criteriorirref erenced tests. Approximately 40 worksheets provide 
alphabetizing practice, word searches crossword puzzles, and 
question-Enswer formats. Activities in the unit on geographical 
dictionar ie^ appropriate for grades 4 and up, teach objectives 
ranging from locating to interpreting information. Students answer 
questions using the table of contents and lists of abbreviations and 
map symbols, complete a chart showing Plains Indian names used as 
place names, and solve a word search containing 22 of those names. 
For teachers seeking more information on Native Americans and 
Eskimos, the handbook provides a selected bibliography of over 300 
books for students, a list of periodicals, and a dictionary of 33 
organizations that provide information. (JHZ)

PREFACE 



The Native American-Eskimo Media Skills Handbook has been developed by the 
staff of .School Library Media Programs, Department of Instructional Resources, 
Mon£gsmery County Public School^ (MCPS). The library media skills cited in 
the handbook have been correlated with the MCPS Goals of Education , the 
Ins tructional Objectives for Information Retrieval and Media Production , the 
Criterion-Referenced Assessment Banks (CRAB) 3, 6, and 9, and the 
Criterion*-Referenced Inventories (CRT) 4, 7, and 10. The library media skills 
have also been designed to support a Board of Education priority dealing with 
the achievement of minority students. 

This handbook includes a list of organizations that may be contacted for 
information about Native Americans and Eskimos, currently published 
periodicals, and a selected bibliography. Contained in each library media 
skill unU are the objectives, the CRAB and CRI assessment levels, the 
materials needed, a procedure for presentation, the activity, and the answers, 

American Indian or Alaskan Native is identified as "a person having origins in 
any of the original peoples of North America, and who maintains cultural 
identification through tribal affiliation or community recognition."*

CULTUKES have more than language problems 

Children from other cultures bring more than language problems with them to an 
MeTTcarT classroom, and the teachers must understand so that precious years of 
development are not wasted. One way many school districts prepare their 
teachers is by conducting special training sessions, such as the one the, Reno 
.(Nev.) Public Schools dld/Tast fall (1983) by cosponsoring a panel at the , 
University of Nevada-Reno. .Here are some of the thoughts the experts shared 
with their audience, as reported i-n the Washoe County School District staff 
newsletter, First Edition : 

The hints ranged from "study a foreign language yourself " so you'll understand 
what the child is going through, to initiate a buddy system right away because 
kids relate quicker wtoh other children. But the bulk of the session 
concentrated on those things teachers tend to overlook when dealing with a 
child from a different culture— attitudes and actions that were perfectly 
acceptable where they came from but can cause serious misunderstanding here. 

For example, students are not supposed to say anything in class in Latin 
America, explained Sheila Rojas of the district's Curriculum Department. 
"They are supposed to sit and be very, very quiet, so it's quite a shock for 
them to find they can talk to you in class." Similarly, teachers may wonder 
why a child may not request extra help with problems. "In many cultures, 
that's not done," Rojas explained. "You would never go up to your teacher 
after clas .. The teacher comes to you." 

The importance of body language should not be overlooked , added Richard Harjoe 
of the Nevada Urban Indians. For example, he explained, Native American 
students may avoid looking a teacher in the eye. "Native Americans are very, 
very reverent in any kind of group situation," he said. "I would never be 
offended if a child keeps looking at his feet. He is showing you respect." 

Touch may also have different connotations , explained curriculum expert 
Shirley Altick, who recalled a summer when a large number of refugees from 
Saigon—some as young as 3— arrived in her program. "I would pat them on the 
head and do all the things you do with 3-year-olds," she said. "Then 
documents came in specifically stating that the Vietnamese did not like to be 
touched on the head. But rather than say anything to me, the Vietnamese 
parents and children had been making allowances for my stupidity." 

Th ere also can be quite a variation in values and attitudes . "A lot of times 
teachers will get upset it: a student doesn't conform, " Kojas said. "As a 
teacherTyou need to respect and understand what's happening." For example,- 
she said, if one Native American student could not answer a question, she 
would not ask another Native American the same question. "He would not answer 
it, even if he knew the answer," Rojas explained, "because he would not want 
to embarrass his friend."

V111 



Some class projects can have implications for the youngsters far beyond what 
the teacher might expect. One such case Rojas recalled involved an art 
project with white^masks. A Native American student refused to participate, 
and further investigation revealed that the mask symbolized impending death to 
the child. -< ' x • > 

x • •• <' 

Vietnamese children whose foreheads were bleeding caused a flurry of paperwork, 
•because of another misunderstanding. "It turns out the Vietnamese scratch 
themselves because. they bel i eve it cures headaches," Altick explained, adding 
that teachers have also been surprised at the Vietnamese discipline method of 
pinching the child's arm until it raises welts. "I told one mother this" could 
cause a problem," she recalled, "but she said, 'That doesn't hurt the 
xhild-- that 's flesh. You hit your children on the bottom^-you could injure 
their spines for 1 ife. '" 

Such cultural differences are not the only issues teachers face when a child 
from another culture enters their classroom. "Teachers are often very, very 
upset because-the student just sits like a bump on a log and doesn't do 
anything," Rojas told the group. "This is nothing to worry about. It doesn't 
mean the student is not learning. Researai shows one of the best ways to 
learn a language is to be bombarded by it." 

For a student to begin speaking and participating , the situation must be as 
nonstressful as possible, and the experts urged th,at the teacher first 
establish a one-to-one relationship with the pupil. "Make sure they know you 
are aware of what they are going through,"^ Rojas advised. 

No matter how understanding a teacher, is » the odds are that the students will ' 
be making more compromises and experiencing move difficulty and trauma than 
the teacher, the experts concluded. "They aru willing to make many more 
allowances for you than you are required to make for them," Altick said.

PROCEDURE FOR PRESENTATION: 



These activities are sequential. Individually, the student completes all 
activities. As a group activity, the names may be divided among the students 
and a class chart compiled. The information from the class chart can be used 
to complete the second activity, What's in a Name ? The answers from this 
activity are the basis for the word search" of the Plains Indians. 



EXTENSION IDEAS: 



Computer: If the students have access to an Apple computer, the PFS File and 
PFS Report, information from the Webster's New Geographical Dictionary may be 
compiled to develop a database. Activities 2 and 5 can be completed trom the 
database. 

Bar graphs can be developed to show the comparative heights of mountains and 
the lengths of rivers, names with the most countries, mountains, and so on. 

Communication : Students can write to the Chamber of Commerce in one of the 
cities or counties for cultural information about Indians. 

Napping : On a map of the United States, with the aid of an atlas, locate and 
label the information from the chart.

PROCEDURE FOR PRESENTATION: 

Introduce the use of an index in a book. 

This can be an introductory activity for fourth graders or a reinforcing 
activity for fifth, sixth, or seventh graders. 

***Quest1on 8 may be used as a "stretching activity" for more capable fourth 
grade students. 

EXTENSION IDEAS: 

Index Your Own. Students may index their own work. A class may write reports 
aTa^unTrproject, i.e., "Indians Who Live in Maryland" or "A Day 1n Rome." 
The individual reports should be typed as chapters and the pages consecutively 
numbered. The chapters may then be subdivided between small groups of student 
indexers. The student indexers should identify topics and their corresponding 
page numbers in the chapters. A cover and a title page should be designed and 
a table of contents compiled. The five segments (cover, title page, table of 
contents, chapters, and index) can then be bound into a class book by the 
students or a bindery. If the pages are dittoed or xeroxed, then each student 
can have a personal copy of the book. \

NATIVE AMERICAN TRAVELING TRUNK 



This trunk may be booked through E&S. It circulates for 
one week and must be picked up and returned. Call 
279-3271. 

The white-based pottery is done by'Dodie Kline, a full 
blooded member of the Isleta Pueblo, New Mexico, using the 
coil method but firing in a commercial kiln since the 
traditional firing technique cannot be utilized in this 
metropolitan area. 

The red-based pottery is done by the Pamunkey potterers 
using their own native clay from their reservation near 
King William, Virginia. The fish-shaped pots are 
decorated and fired in a commercial • kiln by the five 
ladies who constitute the Pamunkey potterers.

Th.ere are several baskets in this collection. One is a 
Mohawk strawberry basket, called such because it is made 
to resemble a strawberry wi£h curls and a cap. The basket 
is made from ash splints. The small sweet-grass basket is 
also Mohawk and the actual construction of the basket is 
the same as the splint basket except that sweetgrass is 
used instead of splints. Sweetgrass baskets are found 
from Maine to Michigan but other areas utilize various 
grasses ir. basketry. The Mississippi Choctaw miniature 
splint basket is an example of another form of splint 
basketry since the Mississippi Choctaws, and other south^ 
eastern tribes, use river cane instead of hardwood for 
splint^. 

The Papago Indians of Arizona make gaskets from the yucca 
(wild banana) plant. The Devil Claw plant is used for the 
black design. A little red is sometimes used from the 
root of the yucca plant. It is a very slow process and 
is one of the oldest of Indian crafts. 



BEADWORK: 



LEAFLETS & 
BOOKLETS: 



MISCELLANEOUS' 



TROLL KITS: 



A variety of the forms of beadwork is included in the 
collection: 

* 

The beaded hair ties are made using the lazy stitch of 
beadwork. ThlTbeaBs are strung on thread and stitched 
into place. It is fairly difficult vo create designs with 
this method. 

Tne daisy chain necklace was made using the Apache 
technique of creating daisy chains. The difference 
between the Apache and other techniques is primarily in 
the use of beads. The daisy chains are created by 
stringing beads on thread and composing daisy chain 
figures by manipulating the thread back through the beads. 

The corn bead nec <1ace is a very simple form of beadwork 
utilizing corn beads (Job's tears) and pony beads to 
create a pleasing pattern. 

-The beaded headband is an example of loom beading in 
which designs are created by carefully following patterns. 

"The First Americans" 
"Indian Arts and Crafts" 

The woven sash is created on the Inkle loom by Linda 
Russell. Woven belts are particularly useful for use with 
various tribal outfits. 

The ojo (God's Eye) was created by Vern Halley, a Tigua 
from"iexas. This artform came from the Huichol Indians of 
Mexico and was absorbed by many Indian tribal groups as 
well as other Americans. The tribal groups have created 
several variations of the ojo, and the sample is of a 
four stick-based ojo. Other variations include the 
beautiful dawa which combines Hopi .sunface symbols with 
Navajo weaving.
