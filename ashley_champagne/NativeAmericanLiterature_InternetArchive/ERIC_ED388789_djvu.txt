A factory or service center creates a classroom that is very different from the one 
we are used to seeing in colleges and adult schools, so it only follows that our approach to 
teaching in the factory should also differ. 

Our goal is to teach employees skills that they need in order to be functional and 
successful in their work environment, and encourage them to apply those skills on the job 
and at home. For example, we motivate students to do the following: 

• work more efficiently and more safely 

• make fewer mistakes 

• solve problems working interactively 

• take greater responsibility for their jobs 

• recognize the interconnectedness of the various jobs in their workplace 

• be better communicators in the workplace 

Company needs are revealed through a needs assessment. At that time, we also 
determine the basic skills needs of the employees. We are learner centered, as the 
individual employee's needs are considered alongside those of the company. 

Once we have determined those needs, we develop curricula that incorporate basic 
skills, using the workplace literature (e.g. forms, applications, codes, abbreviations, charts 
and tables, handbooks, regulations, procedures, policies, memos, letters) of the company. 
Because each company is different, the needs and literature are also different; hence, we 
develop new materials for every company in which we teach. By utilizing these 
workplace items, we help students transfer and apply their skills directly to their jobs. 

We rely on the classroom techniques of problem solving, cooperative learning, 
and group discussion. Our overall approach is concept based, with the emphasis on 
application, such as in role plays, dialogues, and group work. Despite the specific course 
titles, we incorporate the elements of math, English, and communication skills into all of 
our sessions. 

In terms of students evaluation, after initial testing we give a pre-test and post-test 
in order to determine comprehension. Students receive feedback throughout the course 
from the instructor, as well as from fellow students as we sincerely believe in the 
powerful positive reinforcement of peer critiques and cooperative exchanges. 

In essence, we believe that although we make the materials for the students with 
which to work, it is the students who truly make the class.

This competency will reduce the number of job errors that revolve 
around the use of forms, material code numbers, labels, and directions. 

• Students will be more effective communicators in that they will be able 
to use correct verb tenses and time expressions, which will reduce the 
occurrence of misunderstanding or miscommunication. 

• Students will be more adept at giving and receiving instructions, both

ABBREVIATIONS 

Abbreviations are used to replace frequently used words or expressions. For 
example, if you send a package using the United Parcel System, then you have to 
call UPS to pick it up for you. 

♦ Some abbreviations are made from parts of the word that they mean: 

Mo. = MONTH 
Yr. = YEAR 

♦ Other abbreviations are made from taking the first letters from the words that it 
relates to or means: 

QC = Quality Control 

JIT = Just in Time 

♦ If you are not sure what an abbreviation means, then ask! 
"What does UPS mean ?" 

" UPS means United Parcel Service ."

asking and telling what these abbreviations mean.

Very often it is easy to figure what an abbreviation means by the context, or the 
surrounding words. 

Read this set of instructions below. Figure out what the abbreviations mean, and 
then rewrite the instructions using the complete words. 

Then, think of what you could title these instructions:

NUMBER DISCRIMINATION 



Having good number discrimination skills means that you can read numbers 
correctly and tell them apart. Sometimes when we are reading quickly we change 
the numbers in our heads, or we flip them around. This mistake in reading a 
number can lead to a big mistake in your work! So, we have to read numbers 
carefully and slowly. 

Look at these groups of numbers. Each group has one identical pair. Find that 
identical pair and circle it. 

Example: 224 - 242 
442 - 424 

422-422 S identical pair

Symbols are pictures that convey information. Very often, we use symbols to get 
an idea across quickly - that way the person looking at the information does not 
have to read through words, but can get the idea from a picture.

We use ordinal numbers to show ORDER or ranking. In other words, they rank 
something or someone and are put right before the noun. We also use ordinals to 
talk about the date: August 5th, November 23rd, December 25th. 

Examples: 

0 I have one day for vacation (quantity), but it is my first day off this year 
(order). 

0 He takes off July 9th (date). 

0 They have three meals a day. This is their first meal. Their last meal is 
dinner. 

0 You have eight classes. The eighth class is the last one for this session.

work at 8:00, leaves for lunch at 11:45, returns from lunch at 12:30, then works 
until 4:45. He is expected to work an 8 hour day - any time he puts in over this is 
considered overtime. Today, 3/7/94, he worked an extra hour and left at 5:45, so

JOB CODES AND TIME CARDS 



Jim has a busy day and he needs help filling out his Job Labor Card. As you can 
see, not only does he need to keep track of his hours, but he also needs to itemize 
what he does during the day. 

Using the list of Job Codes, fill out Jim's Job Labor Card. 

Today (3/8/94), he goes to get his work order first 
thing in the morning. It takes him 15 minutes to read 
his work order and sees that he will be packaging and 
shipping materials for a large customer. 

It then takes him 15 minutes to set up his work area, 
and after that he spends an hour assembling 60 boxes. 
While the picker is filling the boxes, it takes Jim half 
an hour to assemble the envelope inserts. He then has 
a ten minute coffee break. 

When he returns from his break, he spends the next 20 minutes shrink-wrapping 
the envelope inserts. It takes him another 20 minutes to put the envelopes onto the 
boxes. 

Jim is now ready to run off his labels, which takes him only 10 minutes. Because 
he has so many boxes to address and seal, he spends the rest of his morning doing 
these activities before going to lunch. 

Once he returns from lunch, Jim has to calculate the weight of the shipment. After 
10 minutes weighing, he decides that the shipment is too large and too heavy to 
send via the post office. So, he has to complete the paperwork to send the boxes 
via UPS. This activity takes him 20 minutes. He tags the shipment with box 
numbers and destination codes, and 20 minutes later he does a 10 minute clean-up 
and is ready to do his next job.

TIPS FOR WRITING INSTRUCTIONS 



Instructions tell people how to do things. We use instructions on the job, 
especially when we are trying to do something new, or have been moved to a 
different area for work. 

Instructions are good when they are simple and easy to follow. 



Keep these instructions in mind when you are reviewing your instructions: 

* use clear and strong verbs 

* use simple sentences - one verb 

* use commands 

* describe anything that you think the reader might not know 

* keep a clear order to the steps 

* use numbered steps 

* add any pictures that might help the reader understand 

* make sure that you haven't left out any important warnings . 




P.R.I.D.E. 



Page 130 



PEER CRITIQUE 



Exchange your finalized set of instructions with your partner. Look for these 
things: 

▼ clear verbs 

▼ clear steps 

▼ good sequence 

▼ good descriptions 

▼ good start and end steps 

▼ good overview of purpose
