ABSTRACT 

Many American Indian youth confront a choice of 
forfeiting their cultural heritage in favor of academic achievement. 
The newly established American Indian Magnet School in St. Paul 
(Minnesota) addresses this issue by integrating American Indian 
methodology and ideology across all curriculum areas through 
effective teaching and sensitivity to learning styles of all 
students. The school serves 300 Indian and non-Indian students in 
Grades K~8, and uses cooperative teaching methods, whole language 
instruction, multicultural literature, and noncompetitive assessment 
methods. The school provided action research to rediscover the 
teaching and child-rearing practices of traditional Native peoples 
and to blend "practice into theory." This paper also discusses: (1) 
characteristics needed by teachers of Indian students; (2) elements 
of a teacher education curriculum that espouses a culturally 
responsible pedagogy for Indian children; (3) recommendations for 
classroom techniques; (A) the importance of language preservation 
programs; (5) the debate over the form of Native language 
instruction; (6) "cultural literacy" and the literary canon versus 
multicultural education; (7) matching teaching and learning styles; 
(8) American Indian Studies programs; and (9) developing links 



between school and tribal community.

"Practice into Theory" Journey to the Year 2000: 
Culturally Responsible Pedagogy In Action. . . 
The American Indian Magnet School 

by Cornel D. Pewewardy 

The United National Indian Tribal Youth proclaimed that the national agenda for American 
Indian/Alaska Native youth be the ''The Healing Generation's Journey to the Year 2000.*' Indian 
youth across the country are reclaiming their hope for the future through challenging the 
modem educational practices of schools. As the country embarks upon the "Healing Generation's 
Journey to the Year 2000, much faith, hopes and dreams toward the progress of S(;ience would 
lead to a rebirth of human values and that the education of children would become the highest 
priority of the nation. Today, the age of technology competes with the age of communication with 
major consequences for America's youth. For many Indian youth who confront this situation, 
the consequences mean either forfeiting cultural heritage for academic achievement or 
enriching culture, thus de-emphasizing quality learning experiences. At the newly established 
American Indian Magnet School in the Saint Paul, Minnesota Public School District, we attempt 
to address this issue through quality learning experiences that "place education into culture 
rather than continuing the practice of placing culture into education," for all students. The 
mission is to integrate American Indian methodology and ideology across all curriculum areas 
through effective teaching and sensitivity to learning styles of all students. As a result, students 
realize the value of being capable, knowledgeable, productive and caring members of a free and 
global society. 

American Indian Magnet School 

In recent years, attention has been focused upon processes which emphasize equity and 
schools of choice. This is especially true in large public school districts like St. Paul Minnesota 
Public Schools where magnet schools are made so eductionally attractive because their 
particular emphasis is designed to meet the needs and interests of students and parents. TheyVe 
become "magnetized" to draw voluntary student enrollment. Moreover, magnet schools often 
provide a setting for teacher-generated reform initiatives and are an important component of 
the Saint Paul District's commitment to quality educational and social experiences. 

Society today tends to espouse educational experiences that are dkiactic. Many children 
in America are instructed in textbook learning, lectures and filmstrips; however, still many 
more children rarely experience this method of learning. American Indian education may reveal 
some answers to the paradigm shift in holistic education. Indian education has always been 

ERIC ^> 



experiential and holistic and seen as preparing the young to be productive citizens in the world 
in which they live. 

The American Indian Magnet School (K-8) opened its doors up for 300 Indian and non- 
Indian students for the first time in September 1991. With 54 percent Indian enrollment, the 
new magnet school becomes the first of its kind in Minnesota and second in the entire nation. 
The Native American Magnet School in Buffalo, New York is the first Indian magnet in the 
country and was used as our model. 

Saint Paul's American Indian Magnet School integrates Native ideokDgy and methodology 
across all curriculum areas through effective teaching and sensitivity to learning styles of all 
students-**placing education into culture rather than continuing the practice of placing culture 
into education." 

An important reason for students to attend the American Indian Magnet School is th : 
intrinic interests-Indian cultures provide a rich and varied tapestry of approaches to life. 
Ancient tribal cultures posses a myriad of myths and tales that are culturally diverse. Many of 
these traditions contain beliefs and ideas about the world that achieve high level of 
sophistication, as in the notions about the beginning of the world, the concepts of a lofty 
Supreme Being, and the elaboration of cosmic harmony. In ritual and ceremony, American 
Indian philosophy and thought presents a rich and varied cultural heritage of dramatic beauty 
and spiritual force, primarily expressed in dancing and repetitive movements, prayers, and 
songs. 

Through careful screening, selected and shared literature, students learn to understand 
and appreciate a literary heritage that comes from an American Indian worldview. Students 
learn to identify diverse cultures who created stories, both past and present. They learn from 
the past that storytelling, folktales, myths and legends attempt to clarify the values and beliefs 
of diverse cultures. They learn great stories on which whole cultures were founded. The 
present explores the threads that weave the past with the present, as well as pursue themes that 
we deem appropriate to diverse cultures. 

Equally as important are the personal gains acquired by students when they read great 
works of people of their own cultural backgrounds. Students gain understanding about different 
beliefs and a value system. They develop social sensitivity to the needs of others and realize that 
people have similarities, as well as differences.

Significant aspects of the instructional environment of our school include the absence of 
bells and docks. Teachers and students are not constrained to set "periods'* of time in which to 
"teach" reading, math or any other subject. Student journal writing reflects critical thinking 
skills anri provides teacher feedback on their projected lesson plans. Scope and sequence 
planning allows all culturally responsible teachers to align their overall "theaters of learning" 
for the school year. 

Each teacher has the flexibility to establish and alter his/her instructional schedule to 
address the specific needs of the students. Classiooms are self-contained in "family-style" 
rooms, linked to another class by connecting doors. Team teaching and cross-age grouping 
approaches to instruction capitalize on the strengths of teachers and students alike. These 
cooperative methods ensure the highest degree of social and academic success with the least 
frustration possible. Whole language instruction utilizing a wide variety of multicultural 
literatiTe is employed across the curriculum to strengthen the thinking and communications 
skills of all students-from kindergarten through eight grade. Non-letter grades are used to de- 
emphasize competion for basic skills' grades. Student portfolios and parent-teacher meetings 
are methods used to assure the district's outlined-specific Outcomes Based Education (OBE) per 
grade level based upon year-long goal setting conferences. Our students achieve the desired 
learner outcomes because American Indian sports, games, music and crafts are incorporated 
across ths? curriculum, therefore, learning is relevant to the students' knowledge base and 
culture. 

Practice wisdom 

In that same mode of thinking, there continues to be growing interest in building 
theories from successful practice rather than just trying to put theory into practice. In higher 
education the academy has many times formulated an "ivory tower" attitude that permeates 
many multicultural conferences and consultants of Indian educational programs; many of which 
are a result of "instant" Indian education experts or specialist. 

it's ironic that Indian people are not allowed to be experts on themselves-it's usually 
someone else "defining" the Indian. For example, there have been scores of contributors 
profiting for Native American education, more so in the area of spirituality, and most have been 
tendered some measure of credibility by the "certified scholars" of American universities and 
the academy. So pervasive are these "scholars" that scarcely an Indian in this country has not

been confronted by some "New-Age" like apparition wishing to teach crystal-healing methods to 
recovering Elders, many of whom claim to be a pipe-carrying reincarnation of a 17th century 
Lakota warrior with an assumed "Indian name" such as "Chief Thundercloud" or "Princess Pale 
Moon." 

Of late, there are signs of renewed respect for the importance of "practice wisdom" 
toward building a cultural knowledge base of professional child and youth work. Educational 
researchers are investigating characteristics of exemplar schools throughout the country in 
order to develop models for effective practice. The American Indian Magnet School is attempting 
to provide "action research" toward refining culturally responsible pedagogy in its challenge to 
bring about a new future for Indian youth by the year 2000. 

Children have always been a challenge for Elders; thus, there seem to be few novel ideas 
in how to deal with Indian youth. The American Indian Magnet Schoo! attempts to rediscover the 
pedagogy practiced by traditional Native peoples. Macroculture philosophies of education and 
child care have been heavily influenced by European tradition. The intent of this paper is to 
inform indian youth and educators of new ways to design the future, develop this agenda-this 
Journey to the Year 2000. The healing generation is composed of families, friends, tribes 
and communities taking their rightful place and contributing to the economic and cultural 
prosperity of all Americans. The intent is to use "practice wisdom" and reclaim the untapped 
heritage of American Indian philosophies of child rearing practices. 

Culturally responsible pedagogy 

Beliefs and values learned from society and the educational system may provide us far 
less freedom to choose than we realized. Paulo Freire's (1970) text. Pedagogy of the 
Oppressed , warned us that a major danger of any successful revolution results from the 
oppressed becoming oppressors when they assume positions of power. For those in power 
positions only the names and faces have changed. For what ever reasons many systems resist 
change and the educational system has shown this pattern. If this basic principle hokls true, 
designing culturally responsible pedagogy may amount to nothing more than a change of names 
and faces of those who decide how and what will be learned by Indian students. 

To combat this pattern the American Indian Magnet School was created. The traditional 
American Indian philosophy and thought provides the knowledge base for designing our school. 
Traditional holistic approaches to teaching and learning represent a rebalancing of educational 



ERIC 



5 



practice, moving away from its more than half-century old behavioral and reductionist bent 
(Komoski, 1990). Such a view is that of American Indian philosophy and thought. That is, both 
the Western and Native methodologies recognize the intenrelatedness of the physical, 
psychological, emotional, social, spiritual, and environmental factors that contribute to the 
overall quality of a person's life. No part of the mind, body, or environment is truly separate 
and independent. "We are all related." 

The pedagogy used for learning is based on the traditional American Indian belief that 
children learn and retain knowledge better through experience, touching and active 
participation in educational activities. This process involves field trips, activities, and a 
comprehensive understanding of how things grow and can be used. This learning experience 
allows for a national emergence of respect for nature, self-reliance, and understanding of the 
values and significance of American Indian people 

Theoretical foundations of a culturally responsible pedagogy many times rest upon 
strong cultural variables that are often overlooked in explaining factors in the demise of Indian 
education. Indian children bring to Indian magnet schools a unique set of cultural forms and 
behaviors that include tribal history, language dialect, traditional values, cultural norms, 
rituals, symbolism, imagery and spirituality. Thus, school culture soon becomes a tribal 
environment conducive to feeling good about being Indian, This is incongruous with many non- 
Indian schools that Indian children attend, especially public schools. 

Most Indian students today attend public school. When Indian students are confronted 
with white, middle-class cultural norms and behaviors within many public schools, the result 
is usually "culturally discontinuity" or "lack of cultural synchronization" between students and 
their school. When there is a cultural mismatch between students and their school, Jordan- 
Irvine (1990) contends that the inevitable occurs: miscommunication and confrontation among 
the student, the teacher, and the home; hostility; alienation; diminished self-esteem; and 
eventual school failure. 

Cultural conflicts can be minimized and cultural continuity maximized by restructuring 
teacher training programs to promote the concept of culturally responsible pedagogy. Teachers 
of Indian students in the year 2000 must be conduits through which culturally encapsulated 
monocultural, minority youth become multicultural and multilingual.

Craft wisdom 

Teachers of Indian students should be knowledgeable, sensitive, and comfortable in 
working with Indian students* languages, code switching, style of presentation and tribal 
community values. Whether Indian students come from reservation areas or urban settings, the 
element of obtaining "craft wisdom" is critical to maximizing learning for all students. 
Obtaining craft wisdom many times takes years to acquire. Some teachers have almost a natural 
instinct in adapting and working successfully with diverse populations, while others may take a 
lifetime. 

Craft wisdom comes from acquiring the element of being "street smart," "reservation 
smart," and/or the ability to adapt to culturally diverse populations and geographical locations. 
It also brings together all the personal qualities of classroom leadership. Like "OJT" (on-the- 
job-training), classroom leadership is something to be learned over time, not simply by 
completing a teacher training program. Basic leadership is an art-more tribal than scientific. 
It's more a weaving of relationships than an amassing of information, and in that sense 
encompasses all the elements of craft wisdom. 

Teachers of Indian students must be multicultural, positively orientated toward Indian 
culture, as well as the multicultural school culture. Therefore, higher education's academy of 
teacher training programs must prepare future teachers about culturally responsible pedagogy 
for Indian students. 

Tfc^cher education curriculum 

The teacher education curriculum that espouses a culturally responsible pedagogy for 
Indian children must address the following needs. 

* train teachers to gain classroom experience with Indian children before their student 
teaching internship. 

* train teachers to understand and respect students* cultural knowledge base. 

* study the history and culture of Indian children including their values, stories, music 
and myths, as well as racism/sexism from both cognitive and affective worldviews. 

* train teachers to be reflective practitioners and develop observational, empirical and 
analytical skills necessary to monitor, evaluate and revise continually their respective teaching 
styles. 

* teacher will have to acknowledge the cognition-worldview of Indian children. 



7 



* teacher education must include Indian parents and respective communities in the 
decision-making process. 

* teachers should understand the cultural code switching, dialect and/or language of their 
students. 

* train teachers in interpersonal skills: body language, eye contact, silence, touch, public 
space, facial expression. 

* teacher education must assist preservice and inservice teachers with their fear, 
apprehension, and overreaction related to Indian childrens' styles of personal presentation. 

* supervise student teachers* clinical experiences in strong support system schools. 

Treatment of Indian students 

Although there are no universal characteristics that one can study to understand 
American Indian students, a few common behaviors may seem to be demonstrated by most Indian 
children. 

1. Do not place Indian students in the same category. In some cases, ethnic background 
is the only constant. Many Indian students have middle-class backgrounds. Therefore, they may 
demonstrate many of the same behaviors as other students who hold middle-class values. The 
major difference is these students may receive more peer pressure to "act Indian" than middle- 
class whites do to "act white." 

2. Try not to refer to students as a boy or girl. Some teachers will contend that the 
students are boys and girls and see nothing wrong with the appropriate reference. This belief is 
probably correct, yet the very words boy or girl can cause students to make a mentai reference 
to past experiences of minorities, and some students will become very hostile. 

3. Try not to reprimand students publicly. If there is a need to reprimand a student, it 
should be done in private. Even the most mild-mannered students are likely to fight back when 
embarrassed in front of their classmates. 

4. Whenever possible, ignore foul language, especially if it occurs in jocular, good- 
natured ribbing sessions. These sessions are often an important rite of passage in Indian 
culturt' and critical to the development of peer and social relationships. 

5. Do not assume that a lack of involvement means that the families are not interested in 
the welfaio of the student. Many Indian families will not become involved in the school because 
they do not know what to do; they feel that they do not have the appropriate skills, they work 



ERIC

8 



several jobs, or they feel uncomfortable in the treatment area or in the presence of what may be 
perceived as a white authority figure. 

6. Do not take everything personally. There are times when things will not proceed as 
planned. At times, teachers may feel that it is their fault that students are demonstrating 
certain behaviors. In such cases, they feel that the negative behaviors are directed toward 
them, rather than the situation. Consequently, the relationship between the teacher and student 
may begiri to deteriorate. If it allowed to continue, this relationship will most likely develop 
into a negative situation. 

7. Remember that you are the teacher. Do not try to accommodate students by 
demonstrating their behaviors. It is important that you understand the students and make every 
attempt to help them. In other words, you must respect others if you want to be respected. 

8. Do not try to correct students each time they use nonstandard English. The goal is to 
assist the Indian student in understanding that the usage of standard English is important if they 
wish to become successful in society. 

Language difference 

Tribal differences are very real and tribal affiliations are quite important to Indian 
youth today. One of the main tribal connections to Indian identity is tribal languages, many of 
which are still spoken today. Many historical Indian tribes were wiped out (particularly by 
Europeans) and other groups have no one left who remembers the tribal language, in what is 
today the continental United States alone there lived hundreds of aboriginal groups speaking 
some 250 distinct languages. In that connection, decades ago, perceptive teachers of Indian 
students saw the advantages of using Indian languages and recognized the gap between what 
Indians wanted and what was forced upon them in mission and government schools. 

Most Indian students across the country attend public schools. Therefore, if Indian 
parents and tribal agencies advocate language preservation programs, it appears that greater 
attention needs to be given to the implementation phase of language preservation programs 
and/or Indian studies programs in order for students to learn their tribal languages and culture. 
Marginal programs will fail to attract Indian students who have few tangible connections to 
tribal culture (Pewewardy, 1989). 

Advocates of the **English Only** movement say that a common language is the glue that 
holds a country together-it enables people to understand each other and work toward common 



ERIC 



10 



9 



goals. Granted, few can disagree with that logic. It is difficult for citizens to make responsible 
decisions if they cannot read or write, or even understand the primary language of their 
country. However, I feel that we do not need laws to force people to speak English. Actually, all 
we need is time, as real change comes with real time. 

Change comes slowly with time and real time is still needed to assess all the languages 
that compete for primacy in any given marketplace. To acknowledge that English is the language 
of primacy in the academic marketplace is not a problem for moi;t people, but to acknowledge 
English as the language of primacy in first worid trade-or North American is becoming more 
and more problematic. The academy may be able to adjudicate [what] language usage in the 
classrooms, but certainly does not have the final say over what languages are retained by 
specific cultural groups. 

Not only is the United States diverse today because there are so many different language 
groups, but more so because there may be as many as 57 different varieties of American 
English. It all depends upon what demographic region in which you live. And Indian people are 
no different, as Indian communities across the country have formulated their own type of 
"Indian English." The concept of Indian English suggests a combination of American English and 
their tribal language(s). 

Tribal language inst ruction debate 

There seems to be some confusion about the direction tribal language programs should 
take. For instance, some tribal communities want language immersion programs to occur in ^ 
elementary education, while others want a set of selected courses to be instructed only in the 
later grades (or even higher education) once the student first learns the basic English reading 
and writing skills. Many Indian parents and educators are hesitant to promote these types of 
programs because as mentioned previously, they fear it will be detrimental to their child's 
mastery of regular school subjects. Moreover, the linkage of several tribally controlled 
community colleges are making great strides in promoting, as well as articulating the post- 
secondary tribal language development programs. 

While the debate continues as to the degree of tribal language instruction that is needed to 
preserve our languages, most of us may agree that more tribal language instructors are needed 
in schools. Therefore, it is up to the Indian people (and concerned non-Indian people) to 
preserve tribal languages in school.

Legislation like the Native American Language Act (S. 170i) which passed April 3, 
1990) will help to estat>lish as the policy of the United States the preservation, protection, and 
promotion of the rights of American Indians to use, practice, and develop American Indian 
languages, to take steps to foster such use, practice and development, ' .. J for other purposes. 

CuHural literacy 

The whole matter of relevant education for American Indians is still unresolved. Today 
there is danger on several fronts to a culturally appropriate curriculum for minority group 
children in the United States. The "English Only" movement, as promoted by groups such as U.S. 
English which advocates the adoption of English as an official language jeopardizes the eariy 
education of non-English speaking American children (Crawford, 1989). 

The "cultural literacy** movement that received a lot of media attention a few years ago 
has the following of E.D. Hirsch, Jr.'s two books on cultural literacy: Cultural Literacy: 
What Every American Needs to Know (1987) and The Dictionary of Cultural 
Literacy (1987). Alan Bloom's book is The Closing of the American Mind (1987). 
These books call for a return to the ''classics** and a Eurocentric tradition; these critiques 
bemoan the relativism and **nihilism** of the 1960s and the multicultural movements which, in 
the name of tolerance, have supposedly left our culture in shambles. Reyhner and Eder (1 989) 
advocate that both Hirsch and Bloom jeopardize the teaching of non-Western, non-European and 
non-Judeo-Christian heritages in American schools. 

Simonson and Walker (1988) have since come out with a book refuting the 
Hirsch/Bloom argument for educational reform in American schools. The theme of their new 
book is Opening the American Mind . It is ironic that Hirsch and Bloom never really 
question the political and historical bases of cultural response. Americans could do well to 
become acquainted with the literature and cultures of American Indians, as well as other 
minorities and women. 

Researchers and teachers of minority literature (especially American Indian literature) 
have in recent years been among the foremost critics of the traditional literacy canon, and many 
have attacked the very idea of a standard list of great works to be read and taught. According to 
Coughlin (1990), teaching and research in minority literature becomes more prevalent and the 
formation of minority canons becomes inevitable.

Coanttive learning styles 

Banks (1988) contends that researchers who rejected the cultural deprivation 
paradigm created a conception of the cultural and educational problems of lower-income and 
minority youths based on a different set of assumptions. Banks continues to describe that 
researchers argue that these students, far from being culturally deprived, have rich and 
elaborate cultures. Their rich cultural characteristics are evident in language and 
communication styles, behaviorial LMyids, and values. Ramirez and Castaneda (1974) advocate 
that cognitive, learning, and motivational styles of ethnic minorities such as Afro-Americans 
and Mexican Americans are different from those fostered in the schools. These students, like 
American Indian students, achieve less academically because the school culture favors the 
culture of white mainstream students and places students from other backgrounds and culture at 
a serious disadvantage. The school environment consequently needs to be reformed substantially 
so that it will be sensitive to diverse learning, cognitive, and motivational styles. 

Huber and Peweward/s (1990) learning styles research suggests that all students will 
come to the classroom with many kinds of differences, many of which may be related to their 
ethnic group. This research suggests that teachers w^'! leed to work with minority students to 
help them to see the relationship between their effo^ jnd their academic performance. 
Moreover, teachers and the academy should use a variety of teaching styles and content to appeal 
to diverse students. Concepts should be taught when possible with different strategies so that 
students who are relational and/or analytic in their learning styles will have an equal 
opportunity to learn. 

Many arguments surface when confronting cognitive learning styles research and 
strategies surrounding the advisability of matching teaching styles and learning styles (e.g.. 
Dunn & Dunn, 1979; Gephart, Strother, & Duckett, 1980). Central to this argument is whose 
responsibility is it to change: Should teachers change to accommodate students or should 
students change to accommodate teachers? In that connection, an additional question could be: 
ShouW students be taught using their preferred learning styles or should students be encouraged 
to develop skills associated with non-preferred learning styles? Perhaps one way to address 
these questions is to ask it in another way: Is the student presently learning successfully? For 
Indian students who are not currently demonstrating successful achievement, such as many 
Amertean Indian and other minority students, it might be reasonable to ask teachers to be as 
flexible and adaptable as possible in addressing student needs and to specifically teach to student

Strengths. On the other hand, if students are being sucx:essful, then one might challenge students 
to develop non-preferred learning strategies. 

It is important for teachers to understand that the characteristics of ethnic and 
socioeconomic classes can help us to understand groups but not individual students (Banks, 
1988). All types of learning styles are found within all ethnic groups, as well as social classes. 
We need to access learning styles and how they match learning situations, not just in the 
academy, but in the everyday classroom in American schools. 

Indian studies programs 

The 1960s and 1970s saw ethnic groups assert their cultutal identity and traditions. 
Native Americans have been at the forefront of the movement to preserve ethnic identity. The 
late 1960s saw several student protests that evolved around the establishment of Indian studies 
programs. Indian youth took action such as the take-over of Alcatraz Island where students 
from the colleges and universities of the San Francisco Bay area went to use the abandoned island 
for a cultural studies center. 

Deloria (1974) contends that there were nearly sixty Indian studies programs 
established in colleges and universities during this period of time throughout the country. The 
most popular in that period were the University of Minnesota, University of California at Los 
Angeles, University of Arizona and Montana State University. Now, we can see many more 
Indian studies and special interest support system programs starting at the Pennsylvania State 
University, Arizona State University, University of Oklahoma, Harvard University, Cornell 
University, Stanford University, and the list goes on. Many of these programs were integrated 
into the regular curriculum, providing extensive course offerings which enrolled both Indian 
and non-Indian students. The idea of an Indian and Chicane group took fomn at Davis, California; 
however, the college did not attract many Indian students. 

The attention that Indian Studies were having in higher education affected the attitudes of 
Indian people toward education of their own people. In the Twin Cities Indian groups formed 
**sufvival schools** to teach their children about their cultural traditions, ceremonies and 
languages. Tribal ld>iguages courses were started in almost every urban Indian center. Interest 
in these schools and formulating a cultural knowledge base grew among Indian people of every 
political persuasion-from activists to conservatives. 

Tribally controlled community colleges were seen as vehicles for preserving cultural 



13 

traditions. Early on, the Navajo Community College and other colleges in North and South Dakota 
offered major courses in cultural traditions. Prior to the establishment of these programs* 
macroculture asked Indian people how they expected to preserve their culture in a "high-tech" 
workJ. No one every seemed to have an answer to the questton before the introduction to Indian 
Studies programs. 

The questton at hand is not how to preserve tribal culture and languages, but rather how 
non-Indian culture should be taught in the Indian schools in order to enable Indian students to 
understand and live in white society. 

The academy and the community 

Higher education is essential to schools that educate Indian students toward sharing the 
objective of self-determination. Planning and implementation of educational operations on all 
levels requires the professional research and skilled guidance of qualified personnel. 

For many educators with experience in both K-12 schools and higher education, there 
seems to be a critk^al need for Indian teachers who have experience teaching Indian students, as 
well as working in Indian schools. Teacher training programs should include "cutting-edge" 
culturally relevant research on learning styles of diverse learners; teaching pedagogy; 
community participation; open communication; and evaluation strategies. Within schools that 
have high populations of Indian students, Indian teachers are needed as positive role-models to 
encourage students and provide incentives for students to pursue teaching as a career. 

Teacher training programs must develop culturally responsive curriculum for teachers 
of Indian students. Pewewardy (1990), contends that predominant white institutions have 
impacted Indian students in Oklahoma higher education institution^., as well as showing that 
there seems to be a lack of culture-specific understanding (i.e., icentity and values) of 
communities; culturally responsible pedagogy; parent-teacher corr.munication methods; and 
relating the concepts of tribal sovereignty to self-determination. Aside from direct 
involvement in the field of education, special programs are needed to train Indian teachers in the 
area of socioeconomic development, tribal govemment, and tribal leadership. Higher education 
curriculum must be designed to meet the needs of the students and communities (both urban and 
rural) which they will serve. 

As for higher education institutions which certify Native languages, there are only a few. 
We can learn much from Canadian First Nations toward obtaining federal acknowledgement and

recx)gnition of Native languages in order to justify formalized development in higher education. 
The academy needs to offer more intensive studies of Native languages and reconstruct 
curriculum that will transcend other Native studies teaching levels. Suggestions for 
development include accrediting courses for Native language teachers, enabling equal pay with 
other professionals in the academy, recognition of Elders as professional Native language 
instructors and resource personnel. Moreover, establishment of Native language institutes and 
cultural research centers both at regional and national arenas; offering adult Native language 
instruction classes to school personnel and community members; the use of technology to 
enhance survival and evolution, allowing the academy to facilitate the use of Native languages as 
a second language entrance requirement, and accreditation of Native language courses in higher 
education. Unlike many other languages officially used in this country. Native languages have 
their roots and resources in the tribal communities.

The Holistic Circle of Learning emerges from American Indian "craft wisdom," of 
wherein people saw the education of children as the responsibility of the whole tribe. The 
American Indian Magnet School's effort is to blend "practice into theory," as well as drawn from 
the enduring wisdom of diverse cultures and traditions of other Nations. 

Teachers of Indian students need pedagogical skills that will develop their diverse 
teaching styles. They need to discover the craft wisdom of seasoned teachers who have refined 
methodologies for teaching diverse student populations. To maximize learning, Indian students 
have to define in their own terms, "success" and "winning" from a Amertean Indian worldview. 
For Indian students, the feeling that they have to "act white" should not be a requirement for 
achieving their prescribed learner outcomes. The alternative is found in learning environments 
based on "culturally responsible pedagogy." 

Thus, the intent of this paper has been to raise your level of awareness conoeming these 
related issues in American Indian studies and the community. Whether or not you work with 
Indian students, it is important to consider the circumstances of your studenjts. However, the 
issues that affect Indian students are special and different from those of other students because 
of cultural, linguistic, and historical factors. 

Practice into theory like theory into practice are most likely to find only fragmentations 
of research on ethnicity, social class, and cognitive styles. This type of research is scarce.

however, we can screen through a variety of guidelines for practice into theory. Teachers and 
the academy could learn to select content from diverse ethnic groups so that students from 
various cultures will see their respective images in the curriculum. 

Understanding language differences and cognitive learning styles is critcal in pursuit of 
culturally responsible pedgagogy. Also» the understanding of cultural transmission plays a 
great part in the process of enculturation; the lifelong learning of one's own culture beginning 
from infancy-" Journey to the Year 2000.*' For many Indian students much of this 
includes learning aspects of their own school culture, as well as their student subculture. The 
close network of Indian families permits this learning to occur. Until recently, little of this 
enculturation process was reinforced in reservation schools. In contrast, macroculture 
students are firmly enculturated through schooling because the formal school culture is 
designed for and represents the macroculture student culture. Potentially, culturally 
responsible pedagogy could alter this rigid model of American schools. 

Actually, the bottom line becomes a matter of seeking the answer to this question: How 
can we make education work for, not against Indian children as it has always happened in the 
past? Practice into theory through culturally responsible pedagogy is providing some answers 
to the American Indian Magnet School in Saint Paul, Minnesota Public Schools. Coupled with 
multicultural education, it is another way to educate our future generations toward a process of 
educational equity. It will exist for all students when teachers become culturally responsible to 
the cultural diversity in their classrooms; vary their teaching styles to match their diverse 
student learning styles; and modify their curriculum to include competent, as well as consistent 
cultural content. 

Thus, practice into theory with an American Indian woridview provides a holistic 
approach in education. The basic concepts discussed this paper might be introduced into the 
beginning of the educational process and would provide much of the foundation of building a 
cultural knowledge base toward the healing generation's "Journey to the Year 2000" for 
American Indian and Alaska Native Youth. 

Utilizing educational research on Native American learning styles of haptic, right 
hemispheric thinking and holistic learning, it would be possible for teachers to develop 
culturally responsible pedagogy. By providing practice into theory we provide an increased 
awareness and sensitivity toward "action research" with a focus on bridging the gap between the 
academy and the tribal community.
