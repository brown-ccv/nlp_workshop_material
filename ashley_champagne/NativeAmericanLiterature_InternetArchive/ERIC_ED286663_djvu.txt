ABSTRACT 

To be updated on a continuing basis, the resources 
listed in this catalogue are for teachers and students who are 
interested in Native people 1 s contributions to Alberta and Canada, 
their histories, and their cultures. Section 1 includes two titles, 
"The Land of the Bloods" and "The Feigan: A Nation in Transition," 
which have been approved as basic resources for the Alberta 
curriculum and have been developed by the Native Education Project in 
cooperation with school personnel and the Native community. Both 
titles are available from the Alberta Learning Resources Distributing 
Centre. Section 2 lists 61 titles that are not approved learning 
resources, but have been reviewed and recommended by committees of 
Native teachers. The resources have also been scrutinized using 
Alberta Education's tolerance and understanding criteria and have 
been found to meet these criteria. Each entry includes title, author, 
publisher, date of publication, source from which the material is 
available, a brief description (including format), an annotation, the 
reviewer 1 s comments, and suggested grade level. Published between 
1969 and 1986, the materials include mostly books (three of which are 
written both in English and French), filmstrips, and wallcharts.

DESCRIPTION: 



Filmstrip 



ANNOTATION: 

This material tells the story of Art Solomon, of Native heritage, who almost lost his cultural 
identity. He was well on his way to assimilation into the non-Native community, denying his 
heritage, when he became enlightened through his association with various Indian groups. 
Today, he is a spiritual advisor and lecturer, craftsman and political activist. He applies the 
traditional philosophies of his Ojibwa ancestors to help his people find solutions to 
contemporary problems. 



COMMENTS: 

This material could be used by non-Natives to gain insight into traditional Indian 
philosophies and beliefs. It would be excellent for Native students, as well, to reinforce 
traditional Indian beliefs. It would also initiate study and research into traditional Indian 
beliefs and philosophies.

ANNOTATION: 

Minnie Aodla Freeman was born in the Cape Hope Islands of James Bay at a time when 
Inuit life was encountering many disruptions. The European influence was increasing as 
Inuit children were sent to schools and as settlements were established to replace 
nomadic hunting camps. Minnie's childhood was spent alternating between life on the land 
with her family and life in missionary schools. 

lo this filmstrip Minnie describes her childhood impressions and her personal changes 
from a shy youngster to a mature, confident woman living in a southern city. 



COMMENTS: 

The filmstrip could be used to promote discussion about the activities of Native people 
who leave their community environments.

DESCRIPTION: 



Filmstrip 



ANNOTATION: 

Strater Crowfoot, a Blackfoot Indian from Southern Alberta, recalls his life and educational 
struggles. Because of difficulties at home, Strater's mother sent him to live in a foster 
home. While he was still young he did poorly in school but determination and hard work 
led to academic achievements. 

Strater tells: of the many difficulties he encountered in his search for self-identity and how 
he has learned to bridge the gap between his Native heritage and the non-Native society. 
This is a good example of how a Native person deals with cultural conflict; Strater presents 
a positive role model for both Native and nor Native students. 



COMMENTS: 

May be used in a comparative study with two other filmstrips based on similar portrayals. 
Students also could discuss this topic further and compare Strater's experiences with 
struggles of their own.

The author writes the story of the James Bay Cree as told by a 70-year-old Cree 
grandmother, Wa-wa-tao. Wa-wa-tao lives on the west side of James Bay in Northern 
Ontario. 

The James Bay Cree were a nomadic tribe who got total subsistence from their 
environment. The grandmother describes the geographic area and how they lived and 
survived each season. She recalls, in detail, their historic lifestyles and beliefs. 

The Cree perspective is presented in a sensitive and positive manner. The Cree were a 
sharing and communal society; those with an abundance of food shared with others less 
fortunate. All members of this society are depicted as contributing.

ANNOTATION: 

The autnor tells of her struggles in her relationships at school; the problems underlying 
negative influences and stereotyping are presented. The book is written specifically for

Crucial to any meaningful discussions about Native programs are the problems of 
stereotypes; the ignorance of non-Natives about Native people; and the confusion between 
Native culture and heritage. 



COMMENTS: 

Could be used as a resource for those who are committed to providing a more relevant

ANNOTATION: 

The story tells of the friendship of two boys: Lance, who is Native, and Red, a non-Native, 
in the little town of Alderton, Alberta. 

Lance's Metis mother left him and his Metis father, the foreman of the ranch where they 
live, when he was very young. Lance deals well with being Metis but has difficulty with the 
return of his mother, now a successful Western singer. 

Red has the problem of being a new kid in town besides the problem of a father who is the 
town cop and who drives Red to attain perfection, especially since his older brother is 
permanently hospitalized from a drug overdose. 

The strength of the boys' friendship through some exciting adventures assists each to 
reach a satisfactory resolution to his problems, and to realize, "If you love something, let it 
go; if it was ever yours, it will return."

1980 

Publisher 

Hard cover, 160 pages 



ANNOTATION: 

Molly Brant was a courageous Mohawk woman who became a prominent figure in 
Canadian-American history in the last half of the eighteenth century. She was the daughter 
of an influential family of the Canajoharic Village, part of the Iroquois Six Nations, who 
spent her early life in a longhouse and later at a Mission school. 

At sixteen, the fun-loving, high-spirited girl became the third wife of Sir Willhm Johnson, 
Superintendent of Indian Affairs in British North America. In her new role, she dressed in 
the latest European fashion, was served by slaves, presided over a table set with silver and 
crystal where the elite of colonial society were entertained. 

This proud lady was to become nead of the Society of Six Nations Matrons, see the ravage 
of her people and their lands during the American Revolution, become an Empire Loyalist 
courted by Canadian and British governments for her influence with the Indians. The 
discerning teacher can follow the undercurrent of exploitation of a Native nation, and of 
individuals, in the interesting story of an outstanding Native leader.

Publisher 

Picture book, with text, 27 pages 



ANNOTATION: 

Half of each page has a picture in the vibrant colours and unique art style of the author- 
illustrator, showing scenes, objects and activities of the North. Beside each, in large simple 
printing, is a letter of the alphabet both capital and small letter, followed by a sentence. 
Each picture contains objects beginning with the same letter to tempt the reader-viewer to 
search for them. The book challenges perception skills, as well as encouraging language 
development and a knowledge of the North. 



COMMENTS: 

There is a caution about the reading level of this book. While the pictures are large and 
colourful and the main text is easy to read, there is a smaller supplementary text that lists 
the names of communities that begin with the letter being illustrated. It this text that 
requires a much more advanced level of reading. This does not detract from the 
usefulness of the book at lower grades.

smallpox.

DESCRIPTION: 



Hard cover text, illustrated, 64 pages 



ANNOTATION: 

The Ojibway, like any other Native group, have legends to explain the wonders of nature, to 
pass on history, for behavior modification purposes, and pu r *'y for enjoyment. Legends are 
a vital part of the spiritual and cultural heritage of Indian people. This material contains a 
selection of nine Ojibway legends that explain some of the wonders of nature, e.g., why 
birds go south in winter, how bats came to be, how spiders came to be. One must note that 
when Indian legends are translated into English, much is lost in terms of meaning and 
impact. This material is a combination of traditional tales and contemporary Native art. 



COMMENTS: 

This material could initiate further study and research into legends of different culture 
groups, the culture hero in each, and the similarities and differences in the history of each.

ANNOTATION: 

Native people eloquently speak for themselves in excerpts from speeches and writings of 
Indians between the sixteenth and twentieth centuries from all parts of North America. 
They express qualities of their lives, respect for the environment, and insight into 
spirituality so often misunderstood by Europeans. This is a book to enhance the Native 
self-image, to alert society to injustices and to the need for preservation of the land and its 
resources. The photographs were taken by Edward S. Curtis to provide a pictorial record of 
ways which were becoming extinct. 



COMMENTS: 

There is a need for caution about the expression of some negative sentiments toward 
non-Native people.
