ABSTRACT 

Efforts at diversifying and pluralizing curricula in 
English departments have been under way long enough for many to 
realize that simply adding a few texts by writers historically 
omitted will not promote truly broadened learning. A course on 
"minority literature" (Native-American, As ian-Amer ican , African 
American, and Hispanic) for the Women's Studies Department at the 
University of Minnesota proved to be a pedagogical experiment as well 
as an opportunity to teach fiction by nonwhite women* The class was 
divided into four families, or small research teams, each responsible 
for reporting to the entire class on one aspect of culture for three 
of the units. The four areas of culture chosen for study were music, 
visual arts, mythology/religion/spirituality, and family and state 
structure/governance. One of the highlights of the reports was their 
diversity of format. Writing assignments were the other major 
component of the course. The assumption behind all writing 
assignments was that for white students to interact with literature 
written by "nonwhite" authors requires a new set of critical criteria 
and modes for analyzing and discussing texts. It was essential to 
break down defenses, especially well learned by honors students, 
thereby enabling them to make often painful connections between text 
and self. The assignments were centered around a series of open-ended 
responses to questionnaires and reflections and responses in student 
journals. The course was a major success, though future courses of 
this type would probably concentrate on two rather than three 
cultures because of the restraints of time. (Appendixes include a 
student questionnaire, journal guidelines, and writing assignments.)

Preface 



This technical report is the result of a research project funded by the Center for Interdisciplinary 
Studies of Writing (CISW) at the University of Minnesota. It is pan of a growing series of 
publications designed to support "writing across the curriculum" at the University of Minnesota 
and is available from the CISW. 

The Center annually funds projects that attempt to study any of the following topics: 

•characteristics of writing across the University's curriculum; 
•status reports on students' writing abilities at the University; 
•the connections between writing and learning in all fields; 
•the characteristics of writing beyond the academy; 
•the effects of ethnicity, race, class, and gender on writing; and 
•curricular reform through writing. 

This particular technical report by Professor Toni A. K. McNaron of the English 
Department and the Women's Studies Department and her research assistant, Pamela J. Olano 
of the same departments, highlights their ongoing efforts to support innovative teaching at the 
University, especially attempts to diversify and pluralize the curriculum. The class which was 
the site of their project was the first course bearing honors credit ever to be offered by Women's 
Studies so it had a number of mandates: ( 1 ) it should be imaginatively conceived, (2) it should 
be rigorous, and (3) it should engage students with some of the most challenging question s facing 
the interdisciplinary field of Women's Studies. Because of their commitment to improving the 
writing abilities of University students, McNaron and Olano also decided that the course should 
be a "writing-intensive" course of the kind currently being recommended at the University. Their 
project was a success, by all accounts, and now even more so because it can stand as a model for 
others designing such courses. 

The writing component was well developed and documented throughout the course. 
Readers will find a rationale for the ways writing was used to further the goals of the class. They 
will also find candid discussions for revising the course based upon the project's outcomes. The 
authors' description of the various stages of the course alsc provides a useful framework for 
developing writing activities.

Although the integration of writing into the goals of the course was of key interest to the 
Center, the course also dealt with another common problem at the University — how to prepare 
students for a diverse culture when classes are predominantly populated by while, often middle 
class, students. In this case, most of the students were also white women, narrowing the range 
even further. The creation of "multicultural nests" and family groupings is an experiment in 
cultural immersion that should be helpful to many readers. 

One of the Center's goals is to disseminate the results of its funded projects as broadly 
as possible within the University community and on a national level. We invite responses to and 
discussion of McNaron and Olano's findings and interpretations.

Introduction 



EFFORTS at DIVERSIFYING and pluralizing curricula in English departments have been underway 
long enough for many of us to realize that simply adding a few texts by writers historically omitted 
will not promote truly broadened learning. This course on "minority literature" for the Women's 
Studies Department at the University of Minnesota proved to be a pedagogical experiment as well as 
an opportunity to teach fiction by nonwhite women* Because the Center for Research in 
Interdisciplinary Writing seemed congenial to fledgling ideas, the grant submission proposed to 
construct a teaching team comprised by an English/Women 's Studies professor and a research assistant 
with training in composition theory as well as a developed feminist consciousness. Together we 
designed and executed this course entitled "Multicultural Nests." The plan was to have students 
study the cultures of each of the four women writers we were to read: Native American, Asian- 
American, African- American, and Hispanic. The fieri ve works assigned were Night-Flying Woman, 
by Ignatia Broker, The Joy Luck Club, by Amy Tan: Beloved, by Toni Morrison; and The House of 
Spirits, by Isabel Allende. 

The class, also unique by virtue of its being the first Women's Studies honors course, drew 
primarily white women students; the exceptions were the three men and two minority students 
enrolled. We divided the class into four "families," or small research teams, each responsible for 
reporting to the entire class on one aspect of culture for three of the units. (Because we launched into 
our work on Native American culture the very first day, a lecture format was employed rather than 
group reports. In their final evaluation interviews, several students remarked that they would have 
liked to have had similar reports for this culture as for the others so that there could be consistency in 
that regard. 

The four areas of culture chosen for study were Music, Visual Arts, Mythology/Religion/ 
Spirituality, and Family and State Structure/Governance. While asking students for their preferences, 
the students were assigned to their families based on criteria including background information, 
individual interests, personal experience and attitudes. The name "family" was chosen for these 
teams, rather than 44 small group" because of an experience in a Ford Foundation Workshop on 
Native American women. There it was suggested that the "family" designation could motivate

students to learn to work together in the face of possible personality clashes rather than to seek 
reassignmems in order to avoid conflict While this sounded on the surface like a valuable learning 
adjunct, in practice it was not altogether successful. Students liked the term because it suggested a 
higher degree of commitment than they acknowledged feeling in the usual work groups. However, 
several commented that it replicated a condition in the larger world, i.e. nuclear families from which 
it is often impossible to exit, often oppressive and even abusive to children, especially girls. Upon 
reflection, then, our recommendation would be to retain the term for its positive connotations with 
the stipulation that if students find themselves in units with students with whom they have had past 
difficulties, they have the option to ask for reassignment, facilitated by the faculty of the course. 

Family Reports 

In the first round of reports, each family was over-prepared for the time allowed for presentations 
(thirty minutes, including discussion/question periods). This caused considerable frustration, especially 
in the one instance where a few students speaking first took up much more than their proportionate 
share of the total time, leaving later voices almost no space in which to present the considerable 
findings they had come to class to share. We suggested that each family parcel out the time so that 
monopolization might be kept to a minimum; an evenness was achieved for future presentations. 
We also discussed with them various kinds of "knowledge," accenting that linear reports of factual 
material might not be the most effective format for them to follow. This allowed us to bring in 
elements of feminist pedagogical theory which validate experiential learning and personal distillation 
of f actual matter. The second round of reports reflected their assimilation of our discussion and were 
much less anxiety-ridden for the families involved. These reports were more engaging and facilitated 
active learning of the sort we both have found so helpful in our regular courses. Supplemental 
handouts, containing the fascinating historical information they were discovering and finding so 
compelling, were distributed by each group. 

One of the highlights of the family reports was their diversity of format. When the Visual Aits 
family shared their Hispanic report, they brought carnival/religious masks which the class was able 
to handle and peer out from during the presentation. This emerged as one of the most vividly 
remembered days of the entire quarter. Other such high points included a presentation of a calendar 
containing Frida Kuhlo's art which a family member used to illustrate her symbolism; a group exercise 
in which we collected randomly placed flashcards and were asked to group the key cultural traits 
into logical sets to illustrate theories of African -American family structure; a vivid description by 
one family member of her visit to a local black church service and how that experience brought 
home what she was learning about religion for that culture; the wonderful tapes played before class 
so that wc filtered into the room to the strains of African -American music. One other day emerged

for many as particularly helpful: a Japanese graduate student hearing of the course offered to come 
into class and perform a tea ritual, explaining and answering questions after the event itself had been 
enacted. This helped students understand the highly stylized and formal structure within many 
Asian homes, thereby facilitating their comprehension of the conflicts often dramatized in Amy 
Tan's novel. 

In every instance, even the most frustrating ones, students found these reports intellectually 
empowering because they were themselves the sources of the background information rather than 
an "authority/teacher." They also felt that learning the historical and cultural background in this 
manner imprinted it much more clearly in their minds than if they had received the same information 
hrough lectures or through reading assignments about the cultures under investigation. 

Writing Goals 

The assumption behind all our writing assignments was that for white students to interact with 
literature written by nonwhite authors requires a new set of critical criteria and modes for analyzing 
and discussing texts. Furthermore, coming from our grounding in feminist theory which recognizes 
the silencing of women's voices, we both assumed that the women in our class would not be in full 
possession of their voices — either personal or academic. Indeed, we believed that because our 
students had learned to perform within the academy, whatever powerful voice they might once have 
had as children or young people might well have been blunted. Our experience with the students 
bore out virtually all these preconceptions. 

Our goal in setting up writing exercises was to empower our students in general and to assist 
them in approaching texts constructed along significantly different axes from those with which they 
would be most familiar. Initially, we knew more clearly what this meant not to do than what it might 
mean to do. We did not want students to write routine papers about images of dark and light in a 
given work, about symbolism contained and developed in a given novel, about s;udies in character 
motivation. Such topics presuppose knowledge of whatever larger culture from which the particular 
literary work has sprung and often allow students to avoid more difficult personal interaction with 
texts. 

Since we were planning a Women's Studies course, we knew we wanted students to concern 
themselves with gender relations; but even here, we were on new ground. For instance, several of 
the books represent scenes of violence by a man against a woman close to him. While in no way 
sanctioning or "explaining away" such behavior, we did hope that the students could gain sufficient 
knowledge of how entire cultural groups can be marginalized and brutalized by the dominant society. 
They might then be able to understand that the ever-prevalent violence middle-class white men 
inflict on middle-class white women occurs in a different context.

We felt it essential to break down defenses, especially well-learned by honors students, thereby 
enabling them to make often painful connections between text and self. Simultaneously, however, 
we wanted them not to expropriate the texts and form premature or romantic connections between, 
say, a second generation Chinese daughter arguing with her mother about which language to speak 
or which clothes to wear and their own struggles with their mothers about how late to stay out or 
whom to date. Designing writing assignments which might propel our students into the texts in 
unambiguous and respectful ways led us to design several fresh assignments. 

One of the most positive writing activities involved spontaneous exercises, posed by the instructor 
and executed by students and faculty alike. In two instances, this entailed reading aloud some 
provocative passage from the novel under discussion and then allowing ten minutes for firee- 
associational writing. Another instance was centered around their responses to some central character 
or thematic idea. In all instances, students were invited but in no way coerced to share what they had 
written with the entire class immediately after the exercise was completed. Because the ones read 
were often stunning, we collected all of them for our growing files of student-generated materials. 
The students in general found these brief and unrehearsed exercises immensely challenging and 
empowering of their voices. Perhaps the very spontaneity prevented the kinds of "tightening up" 
that occur when some students are faced with a formal, take-home writing assignment. In any event, 
this strategy worked to enliven discussion and to increase student's perception of themselves as 
persons capable of reflecting on difficult subject matter at a moment's notice. 

While these spontaneous writing exercises were helpful to the students, the more structured 
assignments were at the heart of our work on voice. Because they are so central, we will discuss 
them separately. 

Writing Implementation 

All writing tasks were developed to answer specific questions: 

•What forms of writing will help clarify the complex issues surrounding the diversity that 
these students will encounter in the course? 

•How can the struggles/successes that students experience as they try to capture this diversity 
on paper be best described? 

•What uses of writing best enhance the social/political/cultural goals of this course? 

•How can we enable students to integrate their beliefs/attitudes with other experiences/attitudes/ 

knowledge/beliefs which are presented/encountered during the course? 

•What activities will best facilitate students' interaction 

with "multidimensional" realities? 



11

5 



Using these questions as foundations, our goals were to provide a forum for students' explorations 
of attitudes and beliefs, to "enable" students as knowers and as learners in their encounters with 
multiple realities, and to incorporate writing experiences as an integral part of student self-expression, 
investigation, and development. 

Writing assignments were structured in five stages: Initial Engagement — Open-ended Responses; 
Focus Groups; Narratives; Return Engagement — Open-ended Responses; and In-depth Interviews 
(Case Studies). The five stages represented an integrated program for eliciting students' responses 
at various points during the course and for identifying students' changing patterns of awareness/ 
attitudes. At each stage, oral and written communication was emphasized in both individual and 
collaborative formats. 

Stage One: 

Initial Engagement — Articulation of Open-ended Responses 

This writing assignment was distributed prior to course start-up. Students received an advance 
mailing containing a comprehensive questionnaire (See Appendix A). They were asked to bring the 
completed written responses to the first day of class. The format of the questionnaire, "Written 
Responses to Open-ended Questions," focused on the following. 

♦ A tti tudes/Opi nions : 

Students were provided with a series of open-ended questions designed 
to focus their attention on pre-existing attitudes and opinions prior to 
engagement with course materials. Initial questions took the form of 
anecdotal naiTatives/free association. Embedded questions focused on 
students as knowers (that is, they were asked to identify their own 
knowledge and belief structures prior to the course). Once students 
described their ideological positions, an additional question asked them 
to focus upon why they held these beliefs/this knowledge, how they 
ascertained these perceptions, what events influenced their attitudes. 

•Background and Experience: 

Included in this "survey" were a series of queries designed to identify students' 
own ethnic backgrounds and personal experiences with diversity and in 
multicultural settings, 



12

McNaron and Olano 



•Self-Cgnccpi: 

Students selected a variety of possible identifiers/locators that they believed 
were integral pans of their personal identities. (BEM Personality Inventory 
was used in addition to other descriptive terms.) These self-concept 
identifiers/locators formed some of the threads that students were asked 
to reflect upon in future assignments. 

Stage Two: Focus Groups 

Following the completion of open-ended survey, students were asked to schedule a thirty to 
forty-five minute focus group meeting with the research assistant. These focus groups participated 
in loosely structured discussions which were designed to elicit deeper consideration of the course 
issues. Groups were constructed with two goals in mind; 

• Diversity : 

Students were selected for interaction based upon a diversity of ethnic 
and attitudinal characteristics/experiences (as much as is possible given 
Minnesota's student population) determined by the open-ended responses. 
'Homogeneity: 

Students were selected for interaction based upon common responses 
and/or similarity of attitudes/experiences as indicated by their responses 
to open-ended survey questions, 

Size and number of groups were determined by course enrollment and student responses. Students 
were asked to rank the four "family" groups according to their own level of interest. In every case, 
they were assigned to their first or second interest rating. The research assistant and/or instructor 
were present at each focus group discussion: initial, mid-course, and closing interview. She/they 
did not lead the discussions but served only as facilitator(s). Students were encouraged to give 
serious consideration to what motivated their responses. 

Stage Three: Structured Assignments 

During the first week of class, students were asked to begin a Rcflcctions/Res[X)nses Journal 
(See Appendix B) which required two types of considerations: ( 1 ) responses to course materials, and 
(2) reflections on their own opinions and attitudes in relation to issues of diversity and multicultural 
experiences. These journals served as spring-boards for class discussion and written assignments. 

13

We were especially interested in the changing perceptions of the student as the course progressed 
and as she/he became more familiar with the four cultures considered. Additionally, the student was 
asked to explore her/his own "differences" from the culture in which she/he lives, drawing upon 
lived experience or perceived identities. Students were asked to follow threads of their own 
experiences/perceptions in the personal narratives and to weave a tapestry between/among the 
perceptions expressed by the writers/materials which they encounter in the course. The purpose of 
this written exercise was to acquaint students with the multi-dimensional realities of human existence. 
Through planned and free writing exercises in the journals and through the compilation of personal 
narratives, students created a record of their intellectual and attitudinal development/adjustments/ 
changing views. Personal narratives and journals served as a paper-trail to be used in further 
considerations by the instructor/research assistant. Other structured assignments included retelling 
of family legends, a comparison/contrast exercise on women's ways of knowing as demonstrated in 
the novels, and student selected journal entries (See Appendix C). 

Stage Four: Return Engagement— Open-ended Responses 

During the final week of class, students again responded to the same set of open-ended questions 
presented at the outset of the course. Shifted/static attitudes were clearly discernible. 

Stage Five: Case Studies/ Interviews 

Using student involvement and journals as guides, instructors selected six students for case 
study interviews. Thirty-minute nterviews were recorded for future transcription. Case Studies 
were designed to add a further dimension to results and supplied in-depth information articulated in 
the student's own voice. The use of both oral and written narration was crucial to determining 
students' changing perceptions. 

Conclusions/Recommendations 

Like the man who "discovered" rubber, we found that one of our hypotheses was true quite by 
accident. Having originally planned that each family would give three cultural reports, we were 
convinced by the end of the first round that this expectation was simply too stringent for the time 
constraints inherent in a quarter system. To ease student tension, which seemed fairly high at that 
point, we suggested that the syllabus be altered to allow for the study of only three cultures, 
accompanied by two rounds of student reports. While the class welcomed more time to pursue their 
remaining culture, all of them were sorry to lose the opportunity to study as many different groups as 



14

possible. After much serious discussion, the class decided to drop reports on Asian-American culture 
but to retain the novel originally assigned. Their rationale was a sound one in theory: it was better 
to have a little exposure to the culture than to lose it entirely. 

When the class read Amy Tan's The Joy Luck Club, we sensed a shallowness in the discussion, 
a reversion to familiar literary maneuvers such as talking about imagery or making too easy 
comparisons between the Chinese-American mother-daughter pairs and our own experiences with 
our mothers or daughters. While it was at this point in the course that we invited a Japanese student 
to conduct a formal tea ceremony, the passive watching of this event in no way paralleled their 
previous active engagement in researching the cultural and historical background for themselves. 

During exit interviews and in written evaluative remarks, many students commented on how 
different it was to read Tan's novel without a cultural context than it was to deal with the other 
fictional pieces. By doing so, they in effect volunteered that our assumptions about the value of 
surrounding nonwhite literatures with cultural contexts, of imbedding fiction within a carefully built 
"nest," would enhance student appreciation and understanding measurably. 

A further hypothesis behind this experiment concerned student writing: we believed that by 
constructing contextual nests and by designing atypical writing assignments, a class of essentially 
white students could discover fresh and non-appropriational modes for expressing their responses to 
multicultural literature. Again, the alteration of the syllabus assisted us in unpredictable ways because 
students also commented that they were less sure of what they wrote about Tan than they were in the 
other cases. 

We believe this course was a major success in breaking away from conventional literary 
approaches to fiction written by and reflecting cultures radically different from the one for which 
such approaches were intended. Further, we believe that asking students to respond more personally 
in their written work can establish a valid critical perspective on this diverse literature, helping to 
insure against textual mi sreading and a too-easy assumption of likeness ignoring crucial axes of race 
and class while relying solely on gender considerations. 

Our primary recommendations for future offerings of this kind are to confine a quarter's study to 
only two cultures and for faculty to spend more time building in mechanisms to foster trust among 
students as early in the course as possible. Limiting a course to the study of two cultures would 
allow for two important changes from what was possible in this experimental instance: each small 
research group or family could make more than one report on each culture, allowing them to immerse 
themselves much more fully in whatever aspect of the culture they were studying; several fictional 
works by writers of each culture could be assigned, thereby suggesting the variety of literary production 
within these diverse cultures. 

As for our second recommendation, we have observed in retrospect that issues of trust were a 
major factor in creating the various twists and turns of the course. Both the family groups and

students' individual interactions with the instructors demonstrated their concerns about personal 
safety: emotional and peer group acceptance. Overall, students found themselves deeply involved 
in serious introspection and reexamination of their attitudes and beliefs. Many found this to be 
disconcerting and class discussion often turned to intense conversations during which students tried 
to 4 're-position" themselves. This re-positioning often required that students express culturally 
ingrained beliefs in the context of class discussion. Without the "protection" of academic distance, 
they often felt more exposed than usual. Moreover, because so much of the written activity sought 
to involve students both on a personal and an intellectual level, many individuals felt more vulnerable 
than in other classes. In the final analysis, however, students believed this to be one of the most 
positive aspects of the course due mainly to the atmosphere maintained by the larger and smaller 
groups. 

Perhaps the most complex interactions occurred within the families. While no student expressed 
dissatisfaction with the idea, many were not happy with the day-by-day interactions of the teams. 
Again, problems which confronted the family groups were not foreseen by the instructors: out-of- 
class personal clashes, reluctance of the two students of color to participate wholeheartedly with 
their family groups, scheduling incompatibilities. While some families were able to construct mutually 
convenient meetings, others were never able to do so. Additionally, attrition (students dropped the 
course, took incompletes, or were engaged in directed studies) affected the family dynamics. 

As one student revealed in the closing case study, the family structure of the groups both facilitated 
and hindered her learning experience. When asked to elaborate, she spoke about higher expectations 
and deeper anxiety. It was her belief that the term "family" brought increased pressure to perform 
and more painful disappointments. "Families are like that," she concluded, "Although all the houses 
on a particular block look the same, the lives behind those doors are as unique as the individuals. At 
least with your real family you have a history — be it positive or negative. With our class families, I 
always felt outside of things. It took us a long time to develop the family 'history' that we needed to 
work together," 

The family format obviously carries a number of unspoken and unexamined factors which need 
more careful consideration. In future course offerings, wc would discuss different connotations of 
the term "family," as well as the variety of structures which that term implies. 

Finally, the writing component of the course provided a simultaneous record of students' 
experiences and changing perceptions. Their frustrations and their breakthroughs were recorded in 
the pages of their journals. The "private" inscription of their feelings and the shared "public" readings 
of short, spontaneous in-class writing assignments provided important channels for communication. 
Written expression helped many class members to process the whirlwind of emotions and intellectual 
challenges that they encountered.

JOURNAL GUIDELINES 



RESPONSES ANb REFLECTIONS 
Your journal is a dual record of your reactions 10 the course materials. 

"Side One'* is called the RESPONSES SECTION and can be consider your ACADEMIC 
engagement with the reading materials. We will provide you with questions which can be used to help 
you in your investigations and inquiries. 

"Side Two" is called the REFLECTIONS SECTION. Here you will record your "gut" reactions, 
your introspections, your inner journeys as you encounter new or challenging questions. We hope that 
you will use this section of your journal to investigate your personal reactions to the reading material. 
Please feel free to be creative in this section. Poetry, short "stories" or plays, dialogues, stream of 
consciousness, free association, personal narratives, lyrics, quotes, or just straight-forvard "words on 
the page". . . you may employ ANY writing strategy to articulate your thoughts. 

THE LOGISTICS: Journaling works best in a permanently-bound notebook, This can be something 
special or just a plain notebook. Pages should be standard size: 8.5 x 11. Entries should be substantive 
and reflect your serious engagement with the material. Try to write before each class mccting-a page of 
response, a page of reflection. This may vary according to your need to record your thoughts on a given 
subject or issue. 

Try this: Journaling is more interesting if you challenge yourself to make each entry an important part of 
your experience in this course. We suggest that you PERSONALIZE your journal in some way. Add 
graphics, illustrations, cut-outs, whatevcr-to make this "YOURS/ 4 This is NOT just a journal. ..you are 
CREATING a book of YOUR impressions. 

After the first page in your journal where you should record important information-name, course, 
meeting place, phone number, other miscellaneous info— use the LEFT-HAND SIDE of each DOUBLE 
PAGE for your RESPONSES, the RIGHT-HAND SIDE for your REFLECTIONS. You may continue 
an entry beyond the one-page minimum, but be sure to keep your RESPONSES on LEFT pages, your 
REFLECTIONS on RIGHT pages. With this system you can "bounce" your thoughts in various 
directions, using one side or the other as a SPRINGBOARD for ideas. Try this system, and let us know 
if you like it. ALWAYS DATE EACH ENTRY. 



Responses 



Reflections 



We will collect journals periodically and wc will read and respond to your investigations. If at any time 
you wish to keep an entry PRIVATE, simply fold that page over and wc will respect your wishes.

Writing Assignments

WRITING ASSIGNMENT 1: 



Night Flying Woman is both a personal narrative and a way of transmitting historical information, mylh, and 
memories to another generation. The narrative is one of struggle and pcrscrvcrance, joy and sorrow. In a sense, 
the novel preserves the heritage of the Ojibway tribe through storytelling. 

Our first writing assignment will ask you to perform a similar task. We arc ail members of a particular racial, 
ethnic, religious, cultural, or other kind of group. We each have a heritage which can be characterized in a 
number of different ways. Most of us have experienced being a LISTENER when stories have been told- 
storics which relate to family units, national groups, or global events. 

In this assignment, I would like you to explore STORYTELLING by re-telling a story which was passed down 
to you by word of mouth by an elder. This person may or may not be/have been related to you. This story 
could be one which recaps a family incident, an ancestoraJ anecdote, a cultural myth, or any similar narrative. 

If you note any connections between the story you retell and the novel, please reflect upon those connections. If 
you feel your story demonstrates a different set of realities, consider why this may be so. 

If you have trouble remembering a story that has been told to you, try a FREE ASSOCIATION technique. 
Cluster your thoughts by developing a graphic like the one illustrated here. I have filled in a story from my 
own recollection as an example. Clustering sometimes frees up your memory and allows you to make leaps in 
your imagination. 



Write in your best form. Length: 3-4 paragraphs. 



WRITING ASSIGNMENT 2: 



Submit your ten favorite journal entries . These should contain both the response and 
reflection entries. Keep in mind that we are interested in sharing what you consider to be 
important breakthroughs or realizations. Your reflections may be on the text or on a 
tangent that you explored as a result of class discussion, family matters, reading, etc. 

Your reader will engage in a written conversation with you concerning your entries. We 
invite you to respond to these comments. This is an opportunity to set up another channel 
of communication. 





WRITING ASSIGNMENT 3: 

Write a short response to the following (1-2 pages). Discuss your understanding of the 
statement and use an example from each of the three novels to explain your comments. 

WOMEN'S WAYS OF KNOWING ARE OFTEN DESCRIBED AS 

MULTI-VOCAL. 

Other Considerations: (These may be used as guidelines for your exploration) 

•Do you see similarities/differences between women's ways of knowing in 
the three cultures we have studied? 

•Which woman particularly engaged you in internal reflection? 
•Did you identify more wilh a particular character? Why? 

•How are women's ways of knowing portrayed in a different light than those ot the 
male characters in the novels?
