Preface 



"No other country is so well-positioned to move into the 21 s ' century, to 
live in a global society that is more peaceful and more secure— no one. 

But it all depends upon whether we develop the God-given capacity of 
every boy and girl in this country, no matter where they live, no matter 
what their racial or ethnic or religious background is. " 

President Clinton, October 20, 1994 

The Improving America’s Schools Act (IASA) (P.L. 103-382) enacted in 1994 and signed 
into law by President Clinton is designed to work in tandem with the Goals 2000: Educate 
America Act, the School-to-Work Opportunities Act and the Safe Schools Act ( Title IV of IASA) 
to build the capacity of state (SEA) and local education agencies (LEAs) for addressing reform at 
the local level. Using these legislative acts along with other elements of the education 
system— LEAs, SEAs, the federal government, parents, teachers and the community— it is believed 
that systemic (comprehensive) reform can be more effective. 

In the writing and preparation of the Title VII portion of the IASA, the Congress included 
broad-based statements within Part A, “Findings, Policy and Purpose” that establish a basis for 
federally supported bilingual education program implementation. Although the statements included 
within Part A may be considered as “givens” by many, investigative research was needed to 
determine how current research supports the Congressional findings. 

A review of current research literature on the education of language minority students in 
the United States was conducted in light of the statements included in the IASA legislation. The 
result of the review is the presentation of the “Best Evidence” as it relates to the research 
foundations of the Bilingual Education Act (Title VII of IASA). The author, Jim Crawford, well 
known for his extensive and incisive writings on bilingual education, has organized the document 
according to the Congressional findings on the Bilingual Education Act. A discussion of federal 
policy as it relates to Title VII and some of the issues that have been raised about various aspects 
of language minority education is included in the Introduction. In providing research evidence for 
the Congressional findings, related contradictory views are also cited. This document is designed 
to serve as a resource and reference guide to current research findings about the education of 
language minority students in this country and the basic premises upon which the Congress 
formulated the foundations of the Bilingual Education Act of 1994.

Congressional Findings on the Bilingual Education Act 
(P.L. 103-382, Oct. 30, 1994) 

SEC. 7102. FINDINGS, POLICY, AND PURPOSE. 

(a) Findings. —The Congress finds that— 

(1) language-minority Americans speak virtually all world languages plus many 
that are indigenous to the United States; 

(2) there are large and growing numbers of children and youth of limited-English 
proficiency, many of whom have a cultural heritage that differs from that of their 

English-proficient peers; 

(3) the presence of language-minority Americans is related in part to Federal 
immigration policies; 

(4) many language-minority Americans are limited in their English proficiency, and 
many have limited education and income; 

(5) limited English proficient children and youth face a number of challenges in 
receiving an education that will enable such children and youth to participate fully in American 

society, including— 

(A) segregated education programs; 

(B) disproportionate and improper placement in special education and 
other special programs due to the use of inappropriate evaluation procedures; 

(C) the limited-English proficiency of their own parents, which hinders 
the parents' ability to fully participate in the education of their children; and 

(D) a shortage of teachers and other staff who are professionally 
trained and qualified to serve such children and youth; 

(6) Native Americans and Native American languages (as such terms are defined 

in section 103 of the Native American Languages Act); including native residents of the outlying 
areas, have a unique status under Federal law that requires special policies within the broad 
purposes of this Act to serve the education needs of language minority students in the United 
States; 

(7) institutions of higher education can assist in preparing teachers, administrators 
and other school personnel to understand and build upon the educational strengths and needs of 
language-minority and culturally diverse student enrollments; 

(8) it is the purpose of this title to help ensure that limited English proficient 
students master English and develop high levels of academic attainment in content areas; 

(9) quality bilingual education programs enable children and youth to learn 
English and meet high academic standards including proficiency in more than one language; 

(10) as the world becomes increasingly interdependent and as international 
communication becomes a daily occurrence in government, business, commerce, and family life, 

multilingual skills constitute an important national resource which deserves protection and 
development; 

(11) educational technology has the potential for improving the education 

of language-minority and limited English proficient students and their families, and the Federal 
Government should foster this development; 



(12) parent and community participation in bilingual education programs 
contributes to program effectiveness; 

(13) research, evaluation, and data-collection capabilities in the field of bilingual 
education need to be strengthened so that educators and other staff can 

better identify and promote those programs, program implementation strategies, 

and instructional practices that result in effective education of limited English proficient children; 

(14) the use of a child or youth’s native language and culture in classroom 
instruction can— 

(A) promote self-esteem and contribute to academic achievement 
and learning English by limited English proficient children and youth; 

(B) benefit English-proficient children and youth who also participate 
in such programs; and 

(C) develop our Nation's national language resources, thus promoting 
our Nation's competitiveness in the global economy; 

(15) the Federal Government, as exemplified by title VI of the Civil Rights 
Act of 1964 and section 204(f) of the Equal Education Opportunities Act of 1974, 

has a special and continuing obligation to ensure that States and local school districts 
take appropriate action to provide equal educational opportunities to children and 
youth of limited English proficiency; and 

(16) the Federal Government also, as exemplified by the Federal 

Government's efforts under this title, has a special and continuing obligation to assist States and 
local school districts in developing the capacity to provide programs of instruction that offer limited 
English proficient children and youth an equal educational opportunity . 

(b) Policy. The Congress declares it to be the policy of the United States, in order to ensure equal 
educational opportunity for all children and youth and to promote educational excellence, to assist 
State and local educational agencies, institutions of higher education and community-based 
organizations to build their capacity to establish, implement, and sustain programs of instruction 
for children and youth of limited English proficiency . 

(c) Purpose.— The purpose of this part is to educate limited English proficient children and youth 
to meet the same rigorous standards for academic performance expected of all children and youth, 
including meeting challenging State content standards and challenging State student performance 
standards in academic areas by — 

(1) developing systemic improvement and reform of educational programs 
serving limited English proficient students through the development and implementation 
of exemplary bilingual education programs and special alternative instruction programs; 

(2) developing bilingual skills and multicultural understanding; 

(3) developing the English of such children and youth and, to the extent possible, 
the native language skills of such children and youth; 

(4) providing similar assistance to Native Americans with certain modifications 
relative to the unique status of Native American languages under Federal law; 

(5) developing data collection and dissemination, research, materials development, 

and technical assistance which is focused on school improvement for limited English proficient 
students; and 

(6) developing programs which strengthen and improve the professional training of 
educational personnel who work with limited English proficient students.

I. Introduction 



Congress charted a new policy direction for the Bilingual Education Act when it voted, in 
1994, to reauthorize the law for the fifth time. The change came in response to developments in 
educational research over the past three decades: insights about how children acquire languages 
and how they excel in other subjects. Drawing on this body of knowledge, the new law 
incorporates two important principles: 



■ Given access to challenging curriculum, language-minority and limited-English- 
Proficient (LEP) students can achieve to the same high standards as other 
students . 

■ Proficient bilingualism is a desirable goal, which can bring cognitive, academic, 
cultural, and economic benefits to individuals and to the nation. 1 



Known as Title VII, Part A, of the Improving America's Schools Act, the legislation 
includes a section entitled "Findings, Policy, and Purpose." This comprehensive statement 
explains the federal government's commitment to bilingual education: why the program is needed, 
how it works, who benefits, and what goals are served. It articulates a policy: 

to assist State and local educational agencies, institutions of higher education and 
community-based organizations to build their capacity to establish, implement, and sustain 
programs of instruction for children and youth of limited English proficiency [P.L. 

103-382, Sec. 7102(b)], 

Finally, it details among its purposes: 



to educate limited English proficient children and youth to meet the same rigorous 
standards for academic performance expected of all children and youth, including ... 
developing the English of such children and youth and, to the extent possible, [their] native 
language skills [Sec. 7102(c)],

Research on bilingual education was in its infancy in 1968, when the law was first enacted. 
No one could say with certainty whether the pedagogy would be effective. Congress knew only 
that LEP children faced "serious learning difficulties" in English-only classrooms and that this 
created "a unique and perplexing educational situation" (P.L. 90-247, Sec. 701). The first 
Bilingual Education Act was conceived as an experiment. It would offer financial assistance to 
foster "new and imaginative elementary and secondary school programs to meet these special 
educational needs" (Sec. 702). Educators would develop instructional approaches, researchers 
would evaluate their effectiveness, and policy-makers would respond accordingly. 



Since that time a great deal has been learned. While not all questions have been answered, 
research has increasingly proven the effectiveness of well-designed bilingual programs. Of course, 
language of instruction is just one among many variables that determine how students learn. 
Teaching children in their native tongue is no guarantee of success. Yet, according to a broad 
consensus of researchers, there is no basis for the concern that native-language instruction might 
impede the acquisition of English. To the contrary, there is considerable evidence that skills and 
knowledge learned in the first language "transfer" readily to the second. Thus time spent in a 
quality bilingual classroom is time well spent in learning English and other subjects. 



English proficiency has been and will remain a central goal of Title VII; but not the only 
goal. A coequal priority has been achievement in academic content areas. In 1994, Congress added 
yet another. It recognized the value of preserving, rather than replacing, a child's native language 
— first, as a foundation for learning, and second, as a source of valuable skills. Again, this policy 
is consistent with the latest research. Bilingualism is no longer considered a handicap to cognitive 
growth, but probably an advantage (August & Hakuta 1997). In addition, it is seen as a job skill 
of increasing importance, a tool of cross-cultural understanding, and a vital resource in the global 
marketplace and international relations. 

In reauthorizing Title VII, Congress also heeded recent studies that show the 
ineffectiveness of programs stressing remedial instruction in low-level basic skills (e.g., 
Commission on Chapter 1 1992). It placed a new emphasis on high standards for LEP students and 
greater accountability for bilingual and English-as-a-second-language (ESL) programs, echoing 
familiar themes in the movement for school reform. Toward that end, several changes in the

Improving America's Schools Act are aimed at encouraging holistic approaches — that is, efforts 
to address the unique needs of LEP students in the context of efforts to improve schooling for all 
students. These include: 



■ a reconfiguration of instructional grants to promote comprehensive schoolwide and 
district wide programs; 

■ an enhanced role for state education agencies (SEAs) to facilitate their obligation to 
address LEP student concerns in systemic reform activities under the Goals 2000: 
Educate America Act; 

■ a long-term commitment to strengthening the infrastructure for language-minority 
education by improving research, evaluation, and professional development; 

■ an emphasis on serving more LEP students, and serving them more appropriately, 
through the Title I program for disadvantaged children; 

■ the consolidation of foreign language assistance, along with bilingual and immigrant 
education programs, under the Office of Bilingual Education and Minority Languages 
Affairs (OBEMLA); and 



■ new provisions that require the coordination of services for LEP children among school 
programs funded by Title I, Title VII, migrant education, immigrant education, Indian 
education, and other sources. 



These innovations also helped to frame the discussion of bilingual education in a larger 
policy context. No longer were LEP students viewed as a special case, defined primarily by a 
language "deficit" and a need for compensatory programs. Now they were seen as children who 
share the same capabilities, face many of the same obstacles, and deserve all of the same 
opportunities as other American children. No longer was the policy discussion focused narrowly 
on language of instruction — whether to favor bilingual or English-only approaches. Now a broad 
range of questions was considered, stressing the inclusion of language-minority students in every 
step toward school reform.

13 



In 1994, Congress maintained a balanced approach on the language-of-instruction issue. 
Title VII continues to allocate up to 25 percent of its instructional-program budget to support all- 
English methodologies. (P.L. 103-382, Sec. 71 16[i]). These grants are awarded largely to school 
districts where bilingual instruction is now impractical. Furthermore, when conditions warrant — 
for example, a local educational agency (LEA) enrolls LEP students from numerous language 
groups, or is unable to recruit enough bilingual teachers — the Department of Education may 
provide additional funding, over and above the 25 percent limit, to such "special alternative 
instructional programs" (SAIPs; for detailed definitions of this and other program models, see 
Glossary). 



At the same time, Congress recognized the substantial benefits of programs that are fully 
bilingual, especially those that aim to preserve and cultivate children's native-language skills. 
Helping to build SEAs’ and LEAs’ capacity to provide such instruction remains the primary focus 
of Title VII. In addition, the 1994 law states a new funding priority: to promote "the development 
of bilingual proficiency both in English and another language for all participating students." 



Nevertheless, shortly after the reauthorization of Title VII, the policy it embodies came 
under fierce attack on Capitol Hill and in the press. The 104th Congress considered legislation to 
repeal the law, to eliminate its funding, and — under a sweeping "English only" proposal — to 
outlaw most federal government operations in other languages. So far none of these outcomes has 
occurred. Still, the political climate for bilingual education has never been chillier. Title VII, Part 
A, appropriations were reduced by 38 percent between 1994 and 1996, forcing deep cuts in grants 
for instructional programs, terminating aid for teacher training, and reducing the budgets for 
research, evaluation, and other support services. 

Recent debates over Title VII have featured numerous fallacies — about the program itself, 
about language-minority groups, about second language acquisition, and about educational 
research. According to a widespread popular image, bilingual education means that most LEP 
children are enrolled in foreign-language classrooms, where they receive little English instruction 
and thus learn little English, remaining isolated from the mainstream for five or more years, 
against the wishes of their parents and at enormous cost to the taxpayers — all because of a federal 
mandate imposed on local schools. 



O 

ERIC

None of these assumptions is valid. Moreover, they are directly at odds with the findings 

of Congress when it reauthorized Title VII in 1994. Yet such fallacies have exerted a growing 
influence on discussions of language-minority education, and they have received wide circulation 
in the news media. Indeed, as compared with the findings of educational research, press coverage 
of bilingual education has been disproportionately hostile. A recent survey of publications 
between 1984 and 1994 found that 82 percent of empirical studies and literature reviews were 
favorable to bilingual education, as compared with only 45 percent of editorials in major 
newspapers 1 (McQuillan & Tse, in press). Since public opinion exerts a strong influence on policy- 
makers, it is important to sort out where the factual truth lies in this debate. 



That is the purpose of this report. It will review the research literature that bears on each 
of the Congressional findings, as well as on contradictory views like those cited above. On that 
basis it will seek to determine which statements are supported by scientific evidence, which are 
erroneous, and which cannot be proven or disproven on the basis of current knowledge. 



To the extent possible, this review will rely on the latest research: studies published or 
completed within the past five years. When necessary, it will consider studies that have appeared 
within the past 12 years. In selecting research to include, the author has relied on database 
searches of the National Clearinghouse for Bilingual Education, the Education Resources 
Information Center (ERIC), and the Library of Congress, as well as studies commissioned by the 
U.S. Department of Education, and suggestions by the staff of OBEMLA.

II. Research on Language-Minority Education: The State of the Art 



Researchers have made striking advances since 1968 in the fields of psycholinguistics, 
second-language acquisition, bilingual pedagogy, and multicultural education. Today we know a 
great deal more about the challenges faced by language-minority children and about promising 
strategies for overcoming them. 



At the same time, these are evolving disciplines. Like all social science research, studies 
in these areas are subject to limitations and must be examined critically. Unlike the physical 
science laboratory, the terrain of educational research is the universe of human behavior, where 
variables are numerous, unpredictable, and difficult to control. True experiments, featuring the 
random assignment of students to various educational models being compared, are difficult to 
design. In large-scale evaluations of bilingual education programs, with enough subjects to make 
the results generalizable, they have thus far proved impossible. So complex statistical techniques 
are frequently employed to compensate for pre-existing differences among students, and these are 
inevitably open to criticism. 



Language-minority programs pose their own unique problems for researchers. For 
example, legal and ethical constraints rule out studies that compare bilingual methodologies with 
"no treatment" — sink or swim instruction — which the U.S. Supreme Court has outlawed as a 
violation of LEP children's civil rights (Lau v. Nichols 1974). Moreover, the instruments used to 
gauge students' progress are imperfect, to say the least. Reliable assessments of content knowledge 
in languages other than English are generally unavailable (Hakuta et al. 1993); so most testing 
must be conducted in English. Yet English-language tests are considered unreliable, because LEP 
children differ substantially from the norming population. Studies that compare language-minority 
program models face several such obstacles. 



One approach to reviewing the research literature is to disqualify as meaningless all studies 
whose methodology fails to meet a predetermined set of standards and to base conclusions on those 
that remain. While this may appear scientific, there is no consensus on such standards. Thus the 
procedure is open to abuse, for example, when reviewers use arbitrary criteria to exclude, as 



O 

ERIC 



7 



"methodologically unacceptable," the bulk of research with which they disagree and to include 
mainly those that confirm their biases (see Section II. G.). This approach also tends to discard large 
amounts of evidence gathered by studies that, while imperfect in design, can be valuable when 
considered in aggregate. 



Another approach begins with the recognition that none of the research is without flaws. 
Noting that studies vary considerably in methodological rigor, it takes their limitations into 
account. At the same time, it considers the breadth and consistency of evidence across numerous 
studies — the totality of research findings — rather than dismissing all those that fall short of 
certain criteria. Krashen (1996) hypothesizes, for example, that failure to control for pre-existing 
differences among students is a "flaw [but] not necessarily a fatal one": 

If we look at many studies with nonrandom assignment, and have no reason to believe that 
subjects in different treatments differ in relevant ways, it can be argued that randomization 
of subject assignment has, in fact occurred, because of the large number of studies. In 
other words, many slightly flawed studies can be combined to arrive at a valid analysis. 

This report will take the latter approach. It will seek to present the research consensus, to 
the extent that it exists, on each of the Congressional findings on Title VII. As much as possible, 
it will rely on studies that meet high professional standards — such as publication in peer-reviewed 
journals and anthologies — while noting their limitations where appropriate. 



A. Language Diversity in the U.S.A. 

The Congress finds that— 

(1) language-minority Americans speak virtually all world languages plus many that are 
indigenous to the United States; 

(2) there are large and growing numbers of children and youth of limited English proficiency, 
many of whom have a cultural heritage that differs from that of their English-proficient peers; 

(3) the presence of language-minority Americans is related in part to Federal immigration policies; 



Language diversity is the demographic reality that inspired the Bilingual Education Act of 
1968. In the past 29 years it has increased substantially, as measured by the variety of languages 



spoken in the United States, by the number of minority-language speakers, and most dramatically, 
by the enrollment of LEP students. 

The 1990 census counted 6.3 million youths, aged 5-17, who speak languages other than 
English at home. This marked a 38 percent increase over the previous decade, a period in which 
the overall school-age population declined by 4.5 percent. By a more expansive definition of 
"language minority" — living in a home where a non-English language is spoken — there were 9.9 
million language-minority children, 22 percent of the school-age population (Anstrom 1996). 

More than 325 languages are now used at home by U.S. residents, including at least 137 
Native American languages, according to the Census Bureau (1993a). Virtually all of the world's 
100 most commonly spoken languages are represented here (Grimes, in press; see Table I). If 
anything, these statistics understate the nation's diversity, owing to an acknowledged undercount 
of minorities and other limitations of census data on language use. 2 For example, Krauss (1996) 
has identified 175 Native American languages still spoken in the United States. 



An estimated 31,844,979 U.S. residents — nearly one in seven — spoke home languages 
other than English in 1990. They lived in 14 million households, 16 percent of the nation's total. 
Of these minority-language speakers, 44 percent reported speaking English less than "very well" 
(Census Bureau 1993a) — a response that some researchers regard as a proxy for limited English 
proficiency 3 (MacArthur 1993). Approximately 38 percent of language-minority, school-age youth 
were in this category in 1990; that is, they had "some difficulty" with English (Census Bureau 
1993b). 



In 1993-94, SEAs reported 2,804,556 LEP students enrolled in states and the District of 
Columbia — 7 percent of the nation's elementary and secondary school population — with annual 
increases averaging nearly 10 percent (Donly et al. 1995). This total is surely an under-count, 
since three states declined to participate in the Title VII SEA grant program or to report their LEP 
enrollments to OBEMLA. There are also significant discrepancies between census and SEA 
estimates (see Table II). No doubt these differences reflect variations among states, districts, and 
schools in the ways LEP students are identified, counted, and served, as well as census 



undercounts. 4 The lack of uniform criteria and procedures 5 makes it impossible to place much 
confidence in estimates of LEP enrollments nationwide (CCSSO 1990). In the past decade, 
conservative estimates have ranged from 1.4 million to 3.7 million (Hopstock & Bucaro 1993).

♦Estimated by OBEMLA. SEAs in Pennsylvania and Virginia did not participate in Title VII and did not report LEP enrollments. 

Sources: Census Bureau 1993b; OBEMLA 1992. 



The growth of this population is especially rapid in a handful of immigrant-receiving states, 
six of which enroll an estimated 72 percent of the nation's LEP students (GAO 1994). California, 
the most heavily impacted state, saw its LEP enrollments nearly quadruple between 1980 and 
1995, from 325,748 to 1,262,982 children in grades K-12 (CDE 1995). 

At the same time, the 1990 census found that LEP students are distributed throughout the 
nation. They numbered at least 500, or accounted for at least 5 percent of the school-age 
population, in 533 counties in 47 states. In a third of those counties and in 24 of the 25 largest 
metropolitan areas, there were at least 10 minority tongues represented (GAO 1994). 



Spanish is by far the most prevalent minority language, spoken by about three out of four 
LEP students (Fleischman & Hopstock 1993). Yet the LEP population is increasingly diverse. The 
1990 census identified 33 home languages other than English with at least 100,000 speakers 
(Waggoner 1995). New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Fairfax County, Virginia, are among 
school districts with at least 20 students speaking each of more than 100 different languages 
(McDonnell & Hill 1993). 



Immigration is a major factor in the new diversity. The minority-language population grew 
by 38 percent during the 1980s; those who have difficulty with English, by 37 percent; and the 
number of foreign-born residents, by 40 percent. These statistics are causally related. Since- 1965, 
federal immigration policy has increased both the volume and the diversity of newcomers, who 
now come largely from non-English-speaking countries (Vialet 1991). The proportion of 
foreign-born nearly doubled, from 4.8 percent of the U.S. population in 1970 to 8.7 percent in 
1994 (Census Bureau 1995a). 



Even more significant for American schools, immigrant children now represent a dazzling 
array of cultures. To take an extreme example, in 1995-96 New York City enrolled recent arrivals 
from 204 different countries. Largely because of immigration, U.S. residents of Hispanic origin 
increased by 53 percent in the 1980s, while those of Asian and Pacific Islander backgrounds 
increased by 108 percent, as compared with a 9.8 percent growth in the population as a whole.

Still, it is important to note that more than half of minority-language speakers and more 
than a third of those who report some difficulty in English were born in the United States (Fix & 
Passel 1994). An estimated 41 percent of LEP elementary-school students are native-born 
(Fleischman & Hopstock 1993). These are the children of both recent immigrants and 
long-established ethnic groups: Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, American Indians, Alaska 
Natives, Chinese Americans, and others. These native-born language minorities are growing more 
rapidly than the general population because of higher fertility rates. The 1990 census counted more 
Hispanic women (50 percent) in their child-bearing years (ages 15-44) than non-Hispanic white 
women (43 percent), and determined that, over her lifetime, the average Hispanic woman bears 
1.3 times as many children (Waggoner 1993b). 

There is no question that the growth of minority languages has had a significant impact on 
American communities and, in particular, on American schools. Nevertheless, this demographic 
trend is often misunderstood. 



Fallacy: English is losing ground to other languages in the United States. 



Linguistic diversity is hardly unprecedented in our history. At the time of the nation's first 
census in 1790, French, Spanish, Irish, Dutch, Swedish, and Welsh were well represented, not 
to mention more than 300 indigenous languages. Meanwhile, German Americans accounted for 
8.6 percent of the population — a proportion comparable to that of Hispanic Americans, 9.0 
percent, exactly two centuries later (Crawford 1995). 

More world languages are spoken in the United States today than ever before. But this is 
a quantitative, not a qualitative change from earlier periods. Concentrations of minority-language 
speakers were common in the 19th century, as reflected by laws authorizing vernacular instruction 
in a dozen states and territories. In big cities as well as rural areas, children attended bilingual and 
non-English schools, learning in languages as diverse as French, Norwegian, Czech, and 
Cherokee. In 1900, there were at least 600,000 elementary school children, public and parochial, 
receiving part or all of their instruction in the German language — about 4 percent of the nation's 
elementary school enrollment at the time — and this is probably a conservative estimate (Kloss

1977). Yet English survived without any help from government, for example, in the form of 
official-language legislation. 



Fallacy: Newcomers to the United States are learning English more slowly now than in previous 
generations. 

To the contrary, today's immigrants appear to be acquiring English more rapidly than ever 
before. While the number of minority-language speakers is projected to grow well into the next 
century, the number of bilinguals is growing even faster. Between 1980 and 1990, the number of 
immigrants who speak non-English languages at home increased by 59 percent, while the portion 
of this population that speaks English "very well" rose by 93 percent (Waggoner 1995b). In 1990, 
3 percent of U.S. residents reported speaking English less than "well" or "very well." Only eight- 
tenths of one percent spoke no English at all — a proportion that was 4.5 times as large in the 1890 
census. 



About three in four Hispanic immigrants, after 15 years in this country, speak English on 
a regular daily basis, while 70 percent of their children become dominant or monolingual in 
English, often losing their Spanish skills (Veltman 1988). This does not necessarily mean, 
however, that such children attain the academic proficiency in English needed for success in 
school (see section II.F). Hence their need for special language assistance such as bilingual 
education. 



B. Limited English Skills, Poverty, and Education 

The Congress finds that— 

(4) many language-minority Americans are limited in their English proficiency, and many have 
limited education and income; 

The 1990 census counted nearly 14 million persons — 6 percent of the U.S. population — 
who report some difficulty with English. This group was 12 times as likely to have completed less 
than five years of schooling and half as likely to have graduated from high school, as compared 
with native English speakers (Waggoner 1995c). In addition, children from such households were 
50 percent more likely to live in poverty (Census Bureau 1995b). Prospects , a national study of 







15 



the Chapter 1 program, found that 54 percent of LEP children in grades 1 and 3 came from 
families with incomes under $15,000 — twice the rate for all public school students (Moss & Puma 
1995). At all grade levels, 77 percent of LEP students qualified for free or reduced-price lunches 
in 1991 (Fleischman & Hopstock 1993). 



Poverty is associated with numerous social ills that affect children's readiness to learn, 
including health problems, crime-ridden neighborhoods, substandard housing, domestic violence, 
substance abuse, and family mobility, as parents move frequently to find work. For LEP 
immigrant and refugee children, these difficulties are often exacerbated by the stress of adjusting 
to a new culture (CCSSO 1990). 



C. Challenges for LEP Students 

The Congress finds that— 

(5) limited English proficient children and youth face a number of challenges in receiving 
an education that will enable such children and youth to participate fully in American 
society, including— 

(A) segregated education programs; 

(B) disproportionate and improper placement in special education and other special 
programs due to the use of inappropriate evaluation procedures; 

(C) the limited English proficiency of their own parents, which hinders the parents' 
ability to fully participate in the education of their children; and 

(D) a shortage of teachers and other staff who are professionally trained and qualified 
to serve such children and youth; 



Racial and Ethnic Segregation 



Many of the educational problems of LEP children stem from their segregation in urban 
schools, which are disproportionately poor, nonwhite, underfunded, and underachieving. Over the 
past three decades, this trend has increased steadily for Hispanic students, who are now more 
segregated than any other group, including African-American students. In 1991-92, 73 percent of 
Hispanic children attended elementary and secondary schools with predominantly minority 
enrollments, up from 55 percent in 1968-69. Meanwhile, 34 percent attended schools where more 
than nine in ten students were minorities, up from 23 percent a generation earlier (Orfield et al. 
1993). 




16 



25 



LEP children, on average, are even more segregated. In 1991-92, 55 percent attended 
schools with 91 to 100 percent minority enrollments, as compared with 19 percent of other 
language minorities and 5 percent of native English speakers (Bennici & Strang 1995). 



For such children, education remains both separate and unequal. LEP students are more 
than twice as likely, as compared with their 1st and 3rd grade peers, to attend inner-city schools 
with high concentrations of poor and minority students. Still, these patterns varied considerably 
by ethnic group. In 1991-92, about half of LEP Hispanic 1st graders were in high-poverty schools, 
versus 8 percent of LEP Asian 1st graders (Moss & Puma 1995). 



Segregated schools are also characterized by fewer resources, older facilities, less 
experienced teachers, fewer college preparatory courses, and higher dropout rates. Orfield et al. 
(1993) conclude that "children in such schools are literally cut off from avenues to opportunity 
commonly available in middle class schools." Other recent studies document a "stubborn relation 
between school segregation of Chicanos and lowered academic achievement," reduced high school 
graduation rates, and limited college attendance (Donato et al. 1993). 

Fallacy: Bilingual education encourages the racial and ethnic segregation of language 
minorities . 6 

In the past, limited English proficiency has sometimes provided a pretext for segregating 
minority children — Mexican American students in particular. Since the early 1970s, several states 
have attempted to alleviate this problem by requiring the inclusion of English-proficient students 
in bilingual classrooms (Donato et al. 1993). Nevertheless, there is sometimes a conflict — 
encountered, for example, in court-ordered desegregation plans — between the goals of maximum 
integration and a "meaningful education" for LEP students, another civil rights mandate (Lau v. 
Nichols 1974). To provide appropriate language assistance, some grouping of children by 
language ability is often necessary. Yet this need not prevent their integration with 
English-proficient peers for certain classes or in "two-way" bilingual programs, which have 
proven beneficial to both groups ( see section II.L). 




17 



26 



The potential for isolating LEP students is real, especially as schools group them to make 
efficient use of the limited supply of bilingual and ESL teachers. There is little merit, however, 
in blaming bilingual education for racial segregation. For one thing, only a small percentage of 
Latino students who attend predominantly minority schools are enrolled in bilingual classrooms. 
Moreover, as one principal in East Los Angeles explains, bilingual education often has no impact 
on racial balance: "We were 99.9 percent Hispanic. There was no one else to integrate with" 
(quoted in Crawford 1995). Residential segregation and academic tracking are far more significant 
factors in the isolation of LEP students (Donato et al. 1993). 



Improper Assessment and Placement 

Language-minority students have long been overrepresented in special education 
classrooms. Teachers and administrators often confuse the consequences of limited English 
proficiency, such as underachievement or inattention in class, with learning disabilities or speech 
and language disorders. These mistakes are serious, since improper placements of LEP children 
without real handicaps can be harmful to children's development. One recent study found that 
Hispanic students labeled "learning disabled" lost ground on IQ tests and failed to improve on 
achievement tests after three years in special education (Ortiz 1992). 



At the same time, LEP children who truly are handicapped and do need special help are 
frequently overlooked, again because of schools' failure to provide language-appropriate 
assessments. In a 1987 survey, 28 of 34 responding SEAs said they provided no guidelines to 
school districts on how to evaluate and place LEP students in special education (CCSSO 1990). 
Some recent evidence suggests that Hispanic children are now being assigned to such programs 
at rates more proportionate to their numbers. But "questions still persist as to whether the right 
students are being identified and served." Research into these questions remains limited (Ortiz 
1995). 



Misclassification as educationally handicapped is symptomatic of a broader set of problems: 
inadequate identification, language assessment, achievement testing, and classroom placement of 
LEP students in general. While state guidelines vary considerably in these areas, most are too 

18 




27 



broad to be of value to local districts. Only 12 of 34 eastern SEAs require specific procedures for 
identification and placement of LEP children that would help to prevent mislabeling (O'Malley 
& Pierce 1994). Faced with the language barrier, schools commonly exclude LEP students from 
state-mandated tests and other assessments for accountability — creating a major obstacle to their 
inclusion in school reform efforts (see section II.K). 



Fallacy: Hispanic and Asian children are assigned to bilingual programs on the basis of 
ethnicity, regardless of their English skills. 

Notwithstanding the limitations of SEA oversight, virtually all states specify multiple 
criteria for identifying children who need special language assistance. In 1993-94, half of SEAs 
reported using at least 10 different standards in placing LEP students. These typically included a 
home language survey and various measures of English proficiency — both objective and 
subjective — such as teacher judgments, oral assessments, and achievement tests (Donly et al. 
1995). The Prospects study could find no evidence that schools are violating such state policies 
by arbitrarily assigning students to bilingual classrooms solely because of their family surnames 
or language backgrounds (Moss & Puma 1995). 



Parents' English Skills 



The 1990 census determined that 28 percent of language-minority children, aged 5-17 are 
"linguistically isolated"; that is, they live in households where no one over the age of 14 speaks 
English "very well" (Census Bureau 1993b). Only one-quarter to one-third of the parents of LEP 
students in grades 1 and 3 rate themselves as fully proficient in English, while 40 percent of them 
never speak English, or speak it only rarely, in the home (Moss & Puma 1995). 



Parents whose English is limited are often discouraged from full participation in their 
children's education, because of the language barrier and because of their unfamiliarity with the 
institutional culture of American schools. Yet these obstacles are not insuperable if educators take 
conscious steps to empower parents. Most obvious, schools can translate parent meetings and 
informational materials into prevalent community languages. Second, they can offer adult English 




19 



28 



classes and family literacy programs. Third, they can make explicit the sociocultural knowledge 
— the unstated rules and behavioral expectations — that parents need to participate in a range of 
school activities. Fourth, they can invite parents to volunteer at the school, for example, as 
instructional aides. Finally, they can enter into power-sharing relationships, encouraging parents 
to form advocacy groups and enabling them to share in decision-making about school programs 
and policies (Delgado-Gaitan 1991). 



Certain pedagogical models, such as developmental bilingual education, also facilitate 
parental involvement. In a national longitudinal study, Spanish-speaking children in "late-exit" 
bilingual programs — which used the native language more extensively — were more likely to 
receive a parent's help with homework than those in "early exit" bilingual and English immersion 
programs (Ramirez et al. 1991). 



Shortage of Bilingual and ESL Teachers 



Enrollments of LEP children are increasing faster than staff can be trained to serve them. 
The resulting shortage of qualified bilingual and ESL teachers has been called "the single greatest 
barrier to the improvement of instructional programs for LEP students" (Gold 1992). It also 
accounts for the continuing neglect of a substantial minority of these children, who receive no 
special language assistance — in violation of a two-decade-old mandate (see section II. M). 

While teacher certification requirements vary, they generally involve coursework beyond 
a regular certificate and, for bilingual and sometimes for ESL teachers, proficiency in a second 
language. Thirty-one states and the District of Columbia offer a certification or endorsement in 
bilingual education and 41 do so in ESL, while eight credential teachers in neither field 
(Fleischman et al. 1995). 



According to the National Education Goals Panel (1995), 40 percent of U.S. teachers had 
LEP students in their classrooms in 1994. But of these teachers, only 29 percent had received any 
training - much less certification - in serving LEP students. A 1992 survey found that 93 percent 
of such teachers were non-Hispanic whites; only 42 percent spoke a native tongue of their LEP 

20 



O 

ERIC 



29 



students; and a mere 10 percent were certified in bilingual education, 8 percent in ESL 
(Fleischman & Hopstock 1993). 



National estimates of the shortage of qualified teachers for LEP students range as high as 
175,000 (GAO 1994). But comprehensive and reliable figures are lacking because most SEAs do 
not collect such data (Fleischman et al. 1995). The California Department of Education (CDE), 
one of the few exceptions, reports a four-fold increase in the shortage of bilingual teachers 
between 1985 and 1995 — to 20,692. The unmet demand is strong in all languages, including 
Spanish; in some it is acute. For example, in 1994-95, the state had only seven certified bilingual 
teachers to serve 30,345 Hmong-speaking LEP students. By comparison, California has made 
somewhat more progress in certifying ESL teachers, but the CDE still estimates a shortage of 
12,021 to meet current staffing needs (Gold 1995). These figures were calculated before the state's 
1996 initiative to reduce class sizes. 



The inadequate supply of bilingual teachers has forced many schools to rely on uncertified 
aides, whose only qualification in many cases is the ability to speak a language other than English. 
In 1991-92, nearly three out of five LEP children in high-poverty schools nationwide were taught 
English reading by such paraprofessionals, most with no education beyond high school (Moss & 
Puma 1995). 

Growing LEP enrollments naturally pit school districts in competition with each other for 
qualified staff. In a recent national survey, eight out of ten LEAs reported "some" to "a lot" of 
difficulty in recruiting bilingual teachers and more than half in recruiting ESL teachers 
(Fleischman & Hopstock 1993). The National Center for Education Statistics found that it is "very 
difficult" or "impossible" to find qualified candidates for 38 percent of such positions (Leighton 
et al. 1995). Nevertheless, according to the 1987-88 Schools and Staffing Survey, only 11 percent 
of districts paid stipends to attract such teachers and only 26 percent offered free inservice training 
(Pelavin Associates 1991).

D. Special Status of Native Americans 

The Congress finds that— 

(6) Native Americans and Native American languages (as such terms are defined in section 103 
of the Native American Languages Act), including native residents of the outlying areas, have a 
unique status under Federal law that requires special policies within the broad purposes of this 
Act to serve the education needs of language-minority students in the United States; 



Native Americans — that is, American Indians, Alaskan Natives, Native Hawaiians, and 
Native Pacific Islanders — encounter special academic problems that flow from the erosion of their 
traditional cultures. In particular, "a loss of Native language ability and the wisdom of older 
generations" is associated with identity confusion and school failure among Native students (Indian 
Nations at Risk 1991). This compounds the stress such children already feel from the conflicting 
demands of indigenous and Western values — forcing them "to 'walk in two worlds' with only 
one language" (Reyhner & Tennant 1995). 

Native American languages have been declining for the past century owing to numerous 
factors, notably encroachments by the dominant culture and policies of linguistic genocide 
practiced by federal Indian schools until the 1960s (McCarty, in press). The threat of language 
extinction appears to be increasing — even on isolated reservations, where tribal tongues survive 
among elders but many children grow up speaking only English (Crawford 1996a). According to 
the Alaska Native Language Center, only 20 Native American languages, 11 percent of those still 
spoken, continue to be learned by the youngest generations (Krauss 1996). The remainder are 
"moribund"; that is, unless current trends can be reversed, they will soon have no living speakers. 



Congress sought to counter this threat with the Native American Language Acts of 1990 
and 1992. The first of these laws states a new federal policy "to preserve, protect, and promote 
the rights and freedom of Native Americans to use, practice, and develop Native American 
languages" as a matter of "self-determination" (P.L. 101-477). The second authorizes a grant 
program to assist Indian tribes and other Native organizations in preserving and revitalizing 
endangered languages (P.L. 102-524). 




22 



31 



While most Native American students are English-dominant today, many remain LEP due 
to the influence of indigenous vernaculars and nonstandard English dialects 7 (Leap 1993). This 
special situation was not fully recognized by Congress until 1978, when the Bilingual Education 
Act's definition of limited English proficiency was expanded to address the unique needs of Native 
Americans. Early Title VII programs for such students tended to stress a rapid transition to 
English. On average, they featured significantly more English instruction and significantly less 
native-language instruction than bilingual programs serving other ethnic groups (Rudes et al. 
1988). 



Nevertheless, programs that nurture rather than neglect the indigenous vernacular now 
appear more promising as educational models for Native American students. These approaches, 
such as two-way and developmental bilingual education and Native-language immersion, can 
provide an antidote for children's cultural disorientation — a malady associated with the growing 
incidence of language loss. Consequently, such "bilingual programs are [as] concerned with 
reversing the shift toward English as with facilitating its acquisition" (McCarty, in press). 
Bilingualism thus becomes both an educational goal and a pedagogical means. A growing number 
of Native American schools have embraced the mission of revitalizing indigenous languages, often 
with impressive academic results (for examples, see Ovando & Gourd 1996). 



E. Teacher Training and the Role of IHEs 

The Congress finds that— 

(7) institutions of higher education can assist in preparing teachers, administrators and other 
school personnel to understand and build upon the educational strengths and needs of 
language-minority and culturally diverse student enrollments; 

Institutions of higher education (IHEs) have played an essential role in developing bilingual 
and ESL staff, thanks in large measure to Title VII support through its teacher-training and 
graduate fellowship programs. Since there were few qualified bilingual administrators, resource 
specialists, counselors, curriculum developers, or classroom teachers in 1968, the Bilingual 
Education Act has historically put great emphasis on professional development. Current law 
reserves at least 25 percent of the Title VII, Part A, budget for that purpose. 8 




23 



32 



The Bilingual Education Fellowship Program, created in 1974 to support study at the 
graduate level, has produced many of today’s leaders in the field of bilingual education. A 
follow-up survey of former Title VII fellows determined that 82 percent were working, or had 
worked, in bilingual-education related activities, such as teacher-training, program administration, 
and educational research. It also found that 83 percent of Master's fellows, 72 percent of 
post-Master’s students, and 46 percent of doctoral candidates had completed their degrees 9 
(MayaTech 1991). 



Meanwhile, the Bilingual Education Personnel Training Program has been important in 
supplying teachers who are both certified in methodologies for instructing LEP children and 
proficient in their native languages. A study of projects funded under this program at 81 IHEs in 
27 states, determined that approximately half of the 3,403 teachers in training in 1991 could not 
have continued without Title VII support. Virtually all of the remainder said that without these 
scholarships it would take them considerably longer to complete their education. As measured by 
its contribution to the bilingual teacher supply, this program has been remarkably effective. 
Among recent graduates surveyed, 93 percent had found professional positions in education and 
77 percent were working with LEP children (Riccobono 1992). 



Federal funding has been critical in attracting minority teacher candidates, who generally 
have fewer resources for higher education. But IHEs themselves could show more initiative in this 
area. A review of 46 teacher-education programs in the Southwest found that attempts to recruit 
Latinos to the teaching profession "are sporadic at best. Academic support, program counseling, 
financial, and orientation programs in teacher education seldom target Latino students" (Cox 
1993). IHEs could also do more to assist paraprofessionals — an important pool of potential 
bilingual teachers — to overcome financial, academic, and bureaucratic obstacles to becoming 
certified (Genzuk et al. 1994). 



Still, there are some salient exceptions. A recent case study identified 12 exemplary IHE 
programs for training the teachers of LEP students (Leighton et al. 1995). Among their common 
characteristics are: 




24 



33 



■ “high standards for professional performance," but with students allowed time and 
flexibility to meet them; 

■ "adequate, stable, and long-term financial support"; 

■ a "systemic vision" that gives "high priority to programmatic coherence and 
coordination of" services for LEP students; 

■ "personnel stability, including employment incentives that take into account multiple 
forms of productivity"; 

■ close collaboration between school districts and IHEs; and 

■ an orientation that stresses the "preservation of language resources" (Leighton et al. 
1995). 

Milk et al. (1992) report a growing consensus among IHEs that prospective bilingual and 
ESL teachers need "to create challenging learning environments for language-minority students." 
Thus teacher-training should emphasize "practice and assumptions underlying that practice, not 
... discrete skills." This approach to teaching stresses active and cooperative learning 
environments, higher-order thinking skills, and contextualized environments for language-learning 
(Milket al. 1992). 



F. Title VII Instructional Programs 

The Congress finds that— 

(8) it is the purpose of this title to help ensure that limited English proficient students master 
English and develop high levels of academic attainment in content areas; 



English-language instruction is a key component of all bilingual education programs in the 
United States, whether funded by Title VII or state and local resources (Hopstock et al. 1993a). 
Yet English acquisition is just one of several critical skills and areas of knowledge that LEP 
students need to master. Research has shown that mainly stressing English proficiency, in hopes 
of overcoming students' "language handicap" as quickly as possible, is a recipe for 
underachievement. In classrooms guided by such thinking, there is frequently an inverse 




25 



34 



relationship between the amount of English instruction and the academic progress of LEP students 
(Cummins 1992; Ramirez 1991). For many years this deficit model of schooling confined minority 
children to a prison of low expectations, while their English-speaking peers were learning critical 
thinking skills (Hakuta et al. 1993). 

Title VII's mission is to help schools make the curriculum accessible to LEP students, by 
teaching English and by providing bilingual or "sheltered English" instruction to make subjects 
comprehensible. Many researchers now recommend a combination of both approaches, not only 
to provide access to academic content, but also to teach children a second language without 
replacing their first (see, e.g., Ramirez 1991). Meanwhile, there is a growing body of evidence 
that developing students' native language skills supports their acquisition of English. 

While this may seem counterintuitive, the linguistic theory underlying bilingual education 
is straightforward, if not widely understood. As Krashen (1996) explains: 

We acquire language by understanding messages, by obtaining comprehensible input. 

Similarly, we develop literacy from reading. ... When we give children quality education 

in their primary language, we give them two things: 

1. Knowledge, both general knowledge of the world and subject-matter knowledge, 

[which] helps make the English they hear more comprehensible. This results in more 
English acquisition. 

2. Literacy, which transfers across languages. Here is a simple, three-step argument: ... 

(1) We learn to read by reading, by making sense of what we see on the page. (2) If 
we learn to read by reading, it will be much easier to learn to read in a language we 
already understand. (3) Once you can read, you can read. The ability to read transfers 
across languages [emphasis added]. 

Empirical studies have documented the transferability of skills between a variety of 
languages — several are summarized by Krashen (1996) and Cummins (1988) — as well as the 
academic benefits of well-designed bilingual programs (see section II. G). Thus fears that 
native-language instruction is a distraction from English appear to be groundless. 



26 



ERiC 



35 



Fallacy: The more children are exposed to English, the more English they will learn . 10 



This idea sounds like nothing more than common sense. Wouldn't a full day's instruction 
in any subject yield faster progress than a half day's instruction? Not when it comes to language. 
There is no credible research to support the "time on task" theory of English acquisition — which 
has recently been abandoned by some of its best-known proponents (Rossell & Baker 1996). As 
noted above, second-language input must be comprehensible to lead to acquisition; otherwise it 
amounts to meaningless noise. Research suggests that language acquisition is a natural process that 
cannot be speeded up (Collier & Thomas 1989) — although no doubt it can be slowed down 
through inappropriate schooling. 

Some critics of bilingual education (e.g., Porter 1996) have cited as evidence for the time- 
on-task notion a report by the New York City Board of Education (1994), in which LEP children 
in ESL-only programs were reassigned to mainstream classrooms more rapidly than those in 
bilingual programs. Yet this "study" falls short of minimal standards of educational research, 
failing to control for ethnicity, family income, parental literacy, and other factors that can affect 
student performance. In effect, the report compares Spanish-speaking students (largely enrolled 
in bilingual classrooms) with Russian- , Chinese- , and Japanese-speaking students (largely 
enrolled in ESL programs), without considering socioeconomic differences among these groups 
(Krashen 1996). 

Fallacy: LEP children are retained "too long" in bilingual classrooms, at the expense of English 
acquisition . 11 

Research over the past two decades has determined that, despite appearances, it takes 
children a long time to attain proficiency in a second language — especially the kind of 
decontextualized language needed to succeed in school. Often LEP students are quick to learn the 
conversational English used on the playground. But they normally need four to seven years to 
acquire academic English, if provided quality bilingual education, or seven to ten years, if 
provided only ESL instruction (Collier & Thomas 1989). 




27 



c Vi 



38 



For Title VII policy the implications are clear. Developmental bilingual programs — which 
emphasize a gradual transition to English and offer native-language instruction (in declining 
amounts) through the 5th or 6th grade — provide continuity in children's cognitive growth and lay 
a foundation for academic success in the second language. By contrast, English-only approaches 
and quick-exit bilingual programs can interrupt that growth at a crucial stage, with negative effects 
on achievement (Cummins 1992). 

Fallacy: School districts provide bilingual instruction in scores of native languages n 

Where LEP children are linguistically diverse, rarely are there sufficient numbers of each 
language group to make bilingual instruction practical for everyone. But in any case, the shortage 
of qualified teachers usually makes it impossible. For example, in 1994 California enrolled 
recently arrived immigrants from 136 different countries, but bilingual teachers were certified in 
only 17 languages — 96 percent of them in Spanish (CDE 1995). To the extent that LEP children 
received help in other tongues, they received it almost entirely from paraprofessionals. 

Fallacy: Bilingual education means instruction mainly in students' native language, with little 
instruction in English . 13 



Before 1994, the vast majority of U.S. bilingual education programs were transitional 
(TBE). That is, they encouraged an early exit to mainstream, English-language classrooms. Over 
the years, only a tiny fraction of bilingual educational programs were developmental (DBE) — 
designed to maintain the native tongues of LEP students. In 1978, Congress eliminated Title VII 
funding for such programs altogether. In 1984, it reopened the door to a small number of DBE 
grants and also authorized grants for special alternative instructional programs (SAIPs) using only 
English. From FY1985 through FY1992, 73.4 percent of Title VII, Part A, funding for 
instructional programs supported TBE, 12.4 percent supported SAIPs, and 1.6 percent supported 
DBE. 14 In 1994, Congress eliminated these grant categories in favor of holistic program models. 



Today a majority of bilingual programs continue to deliver a substantial portion of the 
curriculum in English. According to the Descriptive Study of Services, school districts reported 
that 28 percent of LEP elementary school students receive no native-language instruction at all. 
Among the remainder — those who receive some form of bilingual education — about a third are 

28 




37 



taught in English more than 75 percent of the time; a third, from 40 to 75 percent in English; and 
a third less than 40 percent in English. LEP secondary school students are considerably less likely 
to be instructed in their native language (Hopstock et al. 1993a). 

The Prospects study also noted a tendency for the amount of native-language instruction 
to decline over the school year. In 3rd grade bilingual programs surveyed, teachers reported using 
the native language 70 percent of the time in the beginning of the year and only 14 percent by the 
end (Moss & Puma 1995). 

Fallacy: Bilingual education is far more costly than English-language instruction. 

By one widely circulated claim, the nation spends $12 billion a year on bilingual education 
programs at the federal, state, and local levels. 15 This estimate was calculated by multiplying the 
nation's average per pupil expenditure by the estimated number of LEP students in the United 
States. It is erroneous and misleading, for three reasons. 

First, there are no uniform or reliable figures on most state and local spending for bilingual 
education. But we do know that the federal government's contribution has declined over the past 
two decades, while the LEP student population was growing dramatically. The FY1996 budget 
for Title VII, Part A, is $128 million, a reduction of more than 51 percent from the FY1980 level 
of $262.4 million (adjusted for inflation; see Chart I). 

Second, an unfortunate lack of data makes it impossible to estimate reliably the number of 
LEP students enrolled in bilingual education, "structured immersion," ESL-only, or other 
approaches in grades K-12 nationwide. 16 But we do know that only a minority participate in the 
fully bilingual programs recommended by many researchers. In California, the one state that does 
gather comprehensive enrollment data, fewer than 30 pecent of LEP students were taught 
academic subjects in their native language, along with ESL, during the 1994-95 school year. And 
of these students, only about half were in classrooms staffed by certified bilingual and ESL 
teachers (CDE 1995; see Table III). The remaining 70 percent of LEP students received lesser 
amounts of native-language assistance.

Third, the relevant issue here is marginal cost: the expense of bilingual approaches versus 
that of other educational programs for LEP students. 17 Would it be cheaper, for example, to teach 
these children exclusively in English, as some critics assume? School costs are difficult to 
disaggregate, and research on this question has been limited. But a study commissioned by the 
California state legislature used a sophisticated Resource Cost Model to focus some light on the 
problem. In a select group of well-implemented programs, Chambers and Parrish (1992) found 
no budgetary advantage for English-only approaches. To the contrary, it cost about the same ($175 
to $214) to educate a LEP student in classrooms featuring bilingual or "sheltered English" 
instruction and $1,198 to provide ESL-only "pullout" programs. 18 The reason for this differential 
is simple: the pullout approach requires a corps of supplemental teachers, while in-class 
approaches do not (see Table IV). Nevertheless, ESL pullout remains the method of choice for 

30 




33 





many school districts (Hopstock et al. 1993a), especially where LEP students are diverse, owing 
to shortages of bilingual teachers and a lack of expertise in bilingual methodologies.

Fallacy: Disproportionate dropout rates for Hispanic students demonstrate the failure of 
bilingual education . 19 



Hispanic dropout rates remain unacceptably high. Thirty percent of Hispanic youths aged 
16-24, had failed to complete high school in October 1994, compared with 13 percent of African- 
Americans and 8 percent of non-Hispanic whites (Hispanic Dropout Project 1996). Research has 
identified multiple factors associated with this problem, including recent arrival in the United 
States, family poverty, limited English proficiency, low academic achievement, and being retained 
in grade (GAO 1994b; Lockwood 1996). No credible studies, however, have identified bilingual 
education among these risk factors because the program touches only a small minority of Hispanic 
children. For example, in California, 49 percent of Hispanic students were LEP in 1995 and (as 
noted in Table III) less than 30 percent of the state's LEP students were enrolled in fully 
articulated bilingual programs (CDE 1995). 

G. Promoting High Standards and Bilingual Skills 

The Congress finds that— 

(9) quality bilingual education programs enable children and youth to learn English and meet high 
academic standards including proficiency in more than one language; 



This finding aptly summarizes the results of a major longitudinal study (Ramirez et al. 
1991) commissioned by the U.S. Department of Education to compare the effectiveness of 
"early-exit" bilingual education (TBE), "late-exit" bilingual education (DBE), and English 
"immersion strategy" (SAIP). Only well-implemented examples of each model were selected for 
the study. 20 From 1984 to 1988, researchers charted the progress of 2,000 Spanish-speaking 
students enrolled in these programs in California, Florida, New Jersey, New York, and Texas. 
While the study's results are too numerous to review in their entirety, 21 they include the following: 



■ Substantial amounts of native-language instruction do not slow down the acquisition 
of English-language skills, including literacy. 

■ Contrary to expectations, only 17 percent of children in early-exit programs and 26 
percent of those in immersion programs had been "mainstreamed" after 4 years. 




32 



At the outset, early-exit students outperformed immersion students in English reading 
and mathematics, but there was little difference between the two groups after the 3rd 
grade. 



■ Their rates of academic growth roughly paralleled those of English-proficient children 
in regular classrooms, but their achievement remained below national norms. 



■ In the late-exit model, growth curves became steeper the longer students remained in 
the program; their achievement test scores in English reading, English language, and 
mathematics approached (but did not quite reach) national norms by the 6th grade. 



■ This pattern was further confirmed by variations among the late-exit programs 
themselves. In one such program that lapsed into an early-exit model during the study, 
scores fell off dramatically. 



David Ramirez, the principal researcher, explains the policy implications: 

If your instructional objective is to help kids stay where they are —around the 25th 
percentile — then give them immersion or early exit [programs] and they’ll keep their 
place in society. If your concern is to help kids catch up to the norming population, use 
more primary language. In the late-exit programs, they’re growing faster in content areas 
and in English, too. It’s really clear that you will not slow down a child’s acquisition of 
English by providing large amounts of native-language instruction [quoted in Crawford 
1992], 



A review of the Ramirez study by the National Research Council (NRC) questioned the statistical 
procedures used to compare the late-exit model with the other two approaches and concluded that 
the research design failed to control for possible pre-existing differences among students and 
schools. But the NRC endorsed some of the study's major findings, in particular "the importance 
of primary-language instruction in second-language achievement in language arts and mathematics" 
(Meyer & Fienberg 1992). 



Evidence on these points has continued to accumulate. Analyzing the academic progress 
of 42,000 language-minority students over periods of eight to twelve years, Thomas and Collier 
(1996) have confirmed many of Ramirez et al.'s (1991) conclusions. This ongoing research 
compares five well-implemented program types — two-way bilingual education, DBE with

42 



sheltered English (content-based ESL), TBE with sheltered English, TBE with traditional 
(grammar-based) ESL, and traditional ESL pullout alone (see Glossary). The researchers have 
identified a consistent pattern: students' long-term growth accelerates in proportion to the amount 
of native language used. The most promising results are being achieved in the two-way bilingual 
model; the least promising, in the ESL pullout approach (see Chart II).

Fallacy: Research remains inconclusive on the benefits of bilingual education. 



Some critics argue that the great majority of bilingual program evaluations are so 
egregiously flawed that their findings are useless. After reviewing 300 such studies, Rossell and 
Baker (1996) judged only 72 to be "methodologically acceptable." Of these, they determined that 
a mere 22 percent supported the superiority of TBE over "regular instruction" (sink-or-swim) in 
English reading, 9 percent in math, and 7 percent in language. Moreover, they concluded that 
"TBE is never better than structured immersion" in English. In other words, they could find little 
evidence that bilingual education "works." 



Yet a close analysis of Rossell and Baker's claims reveals some serious flaws of their own. 
Krashen (1996) questions the rigor of several studies the reviewers included as "methodologically 
acceptable" — all unfavorable to bilingual education and many unpublished in the professional 
literature. Moreover, Rossell and Baker relied heavily on program evaluations from the 1970s, 
when bilingual pedagogies were considerably less developed than they are today. Compounding 
these weaknesses is their narrative review technique, which simply "counts the votes" for or 
against a program alternative — a method that leaves considerable room for subjectivity and 
reviewer bias (Dunkel 1990). Meta-analysis, a more objective method that weighs numerous 
variables in each study under review, has yielded more positive findings about bilingual education 
(Willig 1985). 22 



Most important, Krashen (1996) shows that Rossell and Baker are content to compare 
programs by label, with little consideration of the actual pedagogies being applied. They treat as 
equivalent all approaches called TBE, even though few program details are available in many of 
the studies under review. Researchers who take the time to visit real classroom^ 3 understand how 
dangerous such assumptions can be. According to Hopstock et al. (1993a), "When actual practices 
... are examined, a 'bilingual education' program might provide more instruction in English than 
...an 'English as a second language' program." Moreover, from a qualitative perspective, LEP 
programs vary considerably in how (one or both) languages are integrated into the curriculum and 
into the social context of the school. Finally, simplistic labels are misleading because "bilingual" 
and "immersion" techniques are not mutually exclusive; several studies have shown that successful 
programs make extensive use of both (see, e.g., Thomas & Collier 1996, Ramirez 1991). 

36

ERIC 



45 



Even when program descriptions are available, Rossell and Baker sometimes ignore them. 
For example, they cite a "bilingual immersion" program in El Paso as a superior English-only 
("submersion") approach, although it included 90 minutes of Spanish instruction each day in 
addition to sheltered English. The researchers also include in their review several studies of 
French immersion in Canada, which they equate with all-English, structured immersion programs 
in the United States. Yet, as the Canadian program designers have repeatedly stressed, these 
models are bilingual in both methods and goals, and they serve language-majority students with 
needs that are quite distinct from those of LEP students in this country . (Cummins 1989). 
Nevertheless, lacking any credible research demonstrating the superiority of structured immersion 
in the U.S.A., 24 Rossell and Baker rely heavily on the Canadian "evidence" in justifying their 
preference for this approach. 



Their study is worth noting, not because it enjoys credibility among other researchers in 
language-minority education, but because this type of review has played a disproportionate role 
in discussions of Title VII policy. While the field as a whole has moved beyond a narrow emphasis 
on language of instruction, such critics continue to treat it as the only significant program variable. 
Evaluation studies are categorized as "pro-bilingual" or "anti-bilingual" — as votes for or against 
program labels — rather than analyzed for lessons about effective schooling. The result has been 
to politicize and polarize the question of how best to serve LEP students. 25 

H. National Need for Language Resources 

The Congress finds that— 

(10) as the world becomes increasingly interdependent and as international communication 
becomes a daily occurrence in government, business, commerce, and family life, multilingual skills 
constitute an important national resource which deserves protection and development; 

Competence in multiple languages is an obvious necessity in diplomacy, national security, 
and the global marketplace. Yet with its persistent rates of monolingualism, the United States 
could be described as an underdeveloped country when it comes to language resources. Hence the 
concern, articulated by a Presidential commission in 1979, that "Americans' gross inadequacy in 
foreign-language skills is nothing short of scandalous, and it is getting worse" (Simon 1980). 
Following this warning, U.S. colleges strengthened their language requirements and thereby 
boosted enrollments in the study of non-English languages, from 23 percent of secondary school 




37 



students in 1982 to 38 percent in 1990 (Draper 1991). Nevertheless, traditional foreign-language 
instruction is failing to produce enough graduates with the communicative skills needed by U.S. 
businesses and government. 26 How extensive is the unmet demand? For the most part, research 
on this question has been limited to case studies covering small samples of employers. Still, a few 
conclusions can be stated with confidence: 



■ "U.S. corporations are beginning to value second language proficiency more highly," 
especially for its role in sensitizing employees to other cultures (Adelman 1994). 

■ In their international operations, large businesses tend to meet their language needs by 
hiring foreign nationals and providing American overseas managers with brief courses 
in conversational skills, primarily for "goodwill" and "social adaptation" (Garcia & 
Otheguy 1994). 

■ Smaller U.S. concerns — the major source of domestic job growth in recent years — 
must rely more heavily on multilingual employees to increase opportunities for trade 
and foreign investment (Fixman 1989). 

■ While English continues to expand as the dominant language of international business, 
it is hardly the only language. Competitors of U.S. firms in Europe, Japan, and Latin 
America increasingly demand that business be conducted in their national languages 
for reasons of cultural identity and economic advantage (Garcia & Otheguy 1994). 



■ The federal government has a broad range of positions requiring language competence, 
especially in the State, Defense, Agriculture, and Commerce departments and in 
various security and information agencies. Unable to rely on the U.S. educational 
system, federal agencies provide their own language training, at considerable cost, but 
proficient personnel remain scarce in numerous critical languages (Clifford & Fischer 
1990). 



Ironically, the unmet demand for foreign language competence comes at a time when these 
very skills are being imported, gratis, by increasing numbers of immigrants to the United States. 
Yet American business and government have largely failed to tap the language resources of 
minority communities (Brecht & Walton 1994).

I. Educational Technology and LEP students 

The Congress finds that— 

(1 1) educational technology has the potential for improving the education of language-minority’ 
and limited English proficient students and their families, and the Federal Government should 
foster this development; 

New learning technologies are transforming many American schools, facilitated by the 
increased availability of computers in the classroom. Yet there are considerable disparities in 
access. A 1988 study by the Office of Technology Assessment found that minority students were 
less likely to have the use of computers, while "LEP students have the lowest access of all" 
(Dunkel 1990). So resource inequities cloud the bright predictions for these new tools. 



Studies over the past two decades have documented real, albeit modest, benefits of 
educational technologies among all students, although studies on their effectiveness among LEP 
students have been limited. Researchers have nevertheless cited numerous ways in which 
computer-based innovations — such as multimedia, word processing, desktop publishing, email, 
and the World Wide Web — promise to enhance achievement for language-minority children 
(Soska 1994). This potential is not intrinsic to the technologies themselves, but to the 
school-improvement strategies in which they are deployed. These include: 



H Multicultural literacy. Relatively inexpensive tools like email can link classrooms on 
several continents. Cummins and Sayers (1995) describe several such partnerships that 
enable students to interact with peers from other cultures. Some of these involve 
parents in intergenerational literacy efforts. The researchers report that "global learning 
networks" have helped children both to confront their prejudices about other groups 
and to better appreciate their own cultures. 



■ Interactive and cooperative learning. Creative uses of technology can address a 
weakness of many LEP programs: teacher-centered approaches stressing rote 
memorization, closed-ended activities, and a passive learning environment. Such 
methods are especially inappropriate for LEP students, who need interactive 
environments to foster second-language acquisition and higher-order thinking skills 
(Ramirez et al. 1991; Dolson & Mayer 1992). Computer-assisted instruction can make 
matters worse — for example, when used solely to drill students in "skill-building" 
exercises. But it can also support alternative approaches. New technologies such as 
hypermedia enable children "to link information together in multiple ways," creating 

39 



O 

ERIC 



48 



open-ended learning opportunities that encourage critical thinking, student-directed 
activities, and collaboration with peers. Hypermedia can also provide meaningful 
contexts and whole-language environments for English acquisition (Bermudez & 
Palumbo 1994). 

■ Improved assessment. New technologies can help schools overcome difficulties in 
language and academic assessments of LEP students. Telecommunications tools such 
as modems, satellites, and computer networks now make expert help available on-line 
and encourage long-distance collaboration among educators. Computer software can 
also improve alternative assessments. Using multimedia, LEP students can assemble 
oral, visual, and written portfolios demonstrating their conversational skills, problem- 
solving abilities, and other work products that display their linguistic and academic 
competencies (Zehler 1995). 



Expense can pose a significant obstacle to realizing the potential of such technologies 
(Dunkel 1990). This problem is most acute in urban schools, where LEP and language-minority 
youth are concentrated. Moreover, the novelty of these tools should not divert attention and 
funding from "low tech" approaches of proven effectiveness — in particular, encouraging children 
to read books on their own. Krashen (1993) cites numerous studies that found a strong correlation 
between free voluntary reading and literacy development, an effect that is especially strong for 
second-language learners. Yet LEP children often have limited access to print. In the Ramirez 
study (1991), language-minority students came from low-income homes with an average of just 
22 books for all family members. Meanwhile, school libraries — for many students, the main 
source of free reading material — are chronically underfunded. One Southern California study 
found that most school libraries serving large Hispanic enrollments had only 2.2 to 5.5 books per 
child and an average of 0.1 to 1 in Spanish (Pucci 1994, cited in Krashen 1996). Improving that 
ratio would not only encourage students to read more; it could also prove a cost-effective 
alternative to computer-assisted reading instruction. 

J. Parent Involvement 

The Congress finds that— 

(12) parent and community participation in bilingual education programs contributes to program 
effectiveness; 



ERIC 

iamaffamiaaa 



40 



When parents participate in their children's education — for example, by helping with 
homework, attending school events, conferring with teachers, serving as volunteers, or 
participating in school governance — low-income, language-minority students are considerably 
more likely to succeed. Parent involvement is associated with numerous benefits: sustained gains 
in academic achievement, enhanced English-language skills, increased cognitive growth, improved 
behavior in school, better home-school relationships, more favorable attitudes toward school, and 
higher self-concept, among others (Bermudez & Marquez 1996; Tse 1996). 



Nevertheless, there are numerous barriers to language-minority parent participation. These 
include not only limited English skills and unfamiliarity with the culture of American schools ( see 
section II. C), but also family mobility, work schedules, lack of self-confidence, negative personal 
experiences with education, and insensitivity of school personnel (Delgado-Gaitan 1991; Bermudez 
& Marquez 1996). So special efforts are needed to involve such parents; these are a component 
of most successful programs for LEP children, as testified by a host of recent of case studies (e.g., 
Kang et al. 1996; Navarette 1996). 27 



One promising approach, supported by Title VII grants since 1984, is the Family English 
Literacy Program. An alternative to traditional ESL classes, such projects target the needs of LEP 
parents with children in Title VII classrooms. Family literacy efforts encourage parent 
participation in various ways, such as stressing parent-child reading activities, teaching second 
languages through practical activities, and offering opportunities to develop literacy skills in the 
native language. In a study of 54 Family English Literacy projects, a majority of parents reported 
that their English had improved in various practical domains. They also cited increased abilities 
to help with children's homework, better communication within the family, more involvement with 
the school, and — as a result — enhanced student achievement (Atlantic Research Corp. 1991). 



A salient feature of exemplary parent-involvement programs has been respect for cultural 
diversity and active efforts to strengthen the native language in the home (McCollum & Russo 
1993). This represents a departure from deficit-model approaches that stress English above all else 
and encourage language-minority parents to use the second language at home with their children. 
Recent research has shown that, when parents' English is limited, they serve as poor models for 
children acquiring the language. More important, LEP students already feel social pressures to 




41 



50 



relinquish their home language — sometimes intensified by English-only preschools — which can 
retard their cognitive and linguistic development. Home language loss can also have "serious 
[negative] consequences for parent-child relationships" (Wong Fillmore 1991). 

Fallacy: Language-minority parents do not support bilingual education because they feel it is 
more important for their children to learn English than to maintain the native language. 

Naturally, when pollsters place these goals in opposition (e.g., LaVelle 1996), immigrant 
parents will opt for English by wide margins. Who knows better the imperative of second- 
language acquisition than those who struggle with language barriers on a daily basis? 28 But the 
premise of such surveys is false. Truly bilingual programs seek to cultivate proficiency in both 
tongues, and research has shown that students' native language can be maintained and developed 
at no cost to English. When polled on the principles underlying bilingual education — e.g., 
"developing literacy in the first language facilitates literacy development in English" or 
"bilingualism offers cognitive and career-related advantages" — a majority of parents are strongly 
in favor of such approaches (see Krashen 1996 for a review of several studies). 



K. Improving Research, Evaluation, and Data Collection 

The Congress finds that— 

(13) research, evaluation, and data-collection capabilities in the field of bilingual education need 
to be strengthened so that educators and other staff can better identify and promote those 
programs, program implementation strategies, and instructional practices that result in effective 
education of limited English proficient children; 

Research 



Federally funded research on the education of LEP students has historically stressed 
massive, time-consuming, and costly attempts to answer a narrow policy question: Which program 
alternative "works" best — bilingual or English-only instruction — and thus deserves the lion's 
share of Title VII funding (August & Hakuta 1997). Yet, as described above, program-evaluation 
research is prone to inherent difficulties in design and execution — not least the diversity of 
language-minority communities, students, and the schools that serve them. Large-scale 
comparisons are problematic when the same program model often yields different results in 





42 



different social contexts (Meyer & Fienberg 1992). More important, the theoretical framework 
of such research is too constricted to explore a range of questions about learning. It tends to 
neglect the complex interactions between linguistic and cognitive growth and between language 
usage and social inequality, which help to shape LEP children's educational experience. Finally, 
by focusing heavily on language of instruction, it tends to reduce other program components to 
insignificance, including effective practices developed through classroom experience. 

After investigating the history of bilingual education research over the past 25 years, the 
National Research Council concluded that: 



There is little value in conducting evaluations to determine which type of program is best. 
The key issue is not finding a program that works for all children and all localities, but 
rather finding a set of program components that works for the children in the community 
of interest, given that community's goals, demographics, and resources [August & Hakuta 
1997], 



The NRC seconded the recommendation of the Stanford Working Group, a panel of researchers 
and policy analysts in language-minority education, which called for studies that are coordinated 
more closely with the needs of practitioners, such as "the development of theoretically sound, 
appropriate assessments to measure the mastery of LEP students in meeting . . . national content 
standards" (Hakuta et al. 1993). 



Evaluation 



Title VII's evaluation component has long been identified as a weak link in the program. 
A majority of project evaluations conducted before the mid-1980s were of such poor quality that 
they offered little guidance to educators or policy-makers (Talmadge et al. 1987). Congress 
responded in 1984 by authorizing two Evaluation Assistance Centers to assist local school 
districts, and in 1986 the Department of Education issued detailed requirements for evaluating 
Title VII projects. Nevertheless, significant problems persist. A recent study concluded that most 
evaluations focus primarily on outcomes — information such as test scores that can be valuable for 
accountability purposes. Meanwhile, they neglect process — information about staffing, 





43 



52 



curriculum, facilities, and other factors that can be valuable for program improvement. In other 
words, Title VII evaluations tend to favor the needs of the grantor over those of the grantee. Yet 
limited use is made of the end-product, either in reviewing grant applications or in analyzing 
policy issues of interest to the field. Moreover, the amount of resources available — an average 
of $3,000 to $4,000 and four to five days of a professional evaluator's time — are insufficient to 
yield meaningful findings, especially in process evaluation (Hopstock et al. 1993b). 

Data Collection 

Data collection on language-minority education, another problematic area, is handicapped 
by such factors as difficulties in appropriate assessment, inadequate record-keeping, and uneven 
reporting by SEAs. Most LEP children have been excluded from the National Assessment of 
Educational Progress (NAEP) for lack of accommodations, such as native-language instruments, 
to make the tests meaningful. 29 NAEP has recently begun to address these problems (Olson & 
Goldstein 1996). 



The annual SEA Survey, required for Title VII state grantees, currently yields a limited 
range of information about LEP students — numbers identified in public and private schools; 
enrollments in federal, state or local programs; achievement test scores; grade retention rates; and 
identification techniques. Unfortunately, a lack of uniform definitions and reporting procedures 
renders much of these data questionable (Donly et al. 1995). Certain states take a more rigorous 
approach — notably California, which requires LEAs to conduct a thorough language census each 
year (CDE 1995). Following this example, an SEA Survey with enhanced reporting requirements 
could gather better-quality national data in additional areas of interest to policy-makers — for 
example, teacher supply and demand, enrollment in various instructional models, and costs of 
program alternatives.

L. Goals of the Title VII Program 

The Congress finds that— 

(14) the use of a child or youth's native language and culture in classroom instruction can — 

(A) promote self-esteem and contribute to academic achievement and learning English by 
limited English proficient children and youth; 

(B) benefit English-proficient children and youth who also participate in such programs; 

and 

(C) develop our Nation’s national language resources, thus promoting our Nation's 
competitiveness in the global economy; 



Promoting Self-Esteem and Academic Achievement 



School programs that strive for additive bilingualism — supporting LEP children's native 
language while they learn English — have proven superior to subtractive approaches not only in 
cognitive-academic benefits (Ramirez et al. 1991; Lambert 1984) but in sociocultural advantages 
as well. Such pedagogies do not treat children as "culturally deprived," or "linguistically 
deficient." Instead, they recognize and build upon the skills, knowledge, and resources that 
students bring from their homes and communities. Thus additive approaches, if well designed and 
executed, can have a strong impact on student attitudes toward school and toward themselves. 
Rather than feeling devalued by their "minority" status, children are encouraged to take pride in 
their backgrounds, expect to succeed academically, and set high career goals. These are among 
the potential effects of bilingual programs — summed up as improved self-esteem — and they are 
correlated with improved achievement, according to a variety of case studies (see, e.g., Garcia 
1992). 



Recently some critics have ridiculed concerns about self-esteem as a symptom of indulgent, 
“feel good” schooling that makes excuses for limited achievers rather than spurring them on to 
success. Such complaints miss the point. Low self-esteem is a social phenomenon, affecting a 
sizable percentage of minority children, not just a handful of laggards. It is a syndrome of 
disempowerment and alienation, exacerbated — if not entirely created — by school experiences 
such as insensitivity toward minority cultures, low expectations by teachers, and deficit models 
of education; in short, by institutional racism (Cummins 1989). On the other hand, schools can 
help to counteract low self-esteem — for example, by incorporating minority languages into the 
curriculum, encouraging parent and community participation, promoting student-directed learning. 



ERIC 




54 



and offering assessments that consider cultural factors, such as students' "disabling" interactions 
with the school (Cummins 1989). Developmental bilingual approaches are consistent with this 
orientation; nevertheless, such interventions must be conscious in order to succeed. 



Fostering Bilingualism and Multicultural Understanding 



Bilingual education is far more than a remedy for limited English proficiency or a stopgap 
to keep LEP students from falling behind in other subjects while acquiring a second language. It 
has great potential, only beginning to be realized, to develop critical language skills that are now 
in short supply (see section II. H). One promising approach — described variously as two-way 
bilingual education, dual-language instruction, and bilingual immersion — enrolls both native- 
English-speaking and LEP students, to the mutual benefit of both groups. Children serve as peer 
tutors, learning each others' languages more effectively than in traditional foreign-language or 
ESL instruction. Two-way approaches draw on research in immersion education, which shows that 
second languages are best acquired naturally, through their use in meaningful communication — 
for example, through sheltered content instruction in academic subjects, which makes input 
comprehensible. They also rely on developmental bilingual strategies for cultivating — rather than 
replacing — the native-language skills of minority students (Christian & Mahrer 1992). 



These programs can foster fluent bilingualism, at no cost to progress in other subjects, as 
documented by longitudinal studies in which both LEP and non-LEP students achieved at or above 
national norms. Indeed, the higher the bilingual proficiency, the higher the academic achievement 
(Lindholm & Aclan 1991). Minority children appear to benefit in particular from social 
interactions in the two-way bilingual classroom — not only by mixing with native-English 
speakers, but also by sharing a valuable resource: their native tongue. Defined by what they know 
rather than by what they lack, these students tend to develop more positive feelings toward school 
and toward their own capabilities than their counterparts in traditional LEP programs. Meanwhile, 
this model stimulates in both groups a greater interest in other cultures and provides a practical 
key — language — for unlocking them (Merrill 1993). 

Two-way bilingual education is growing rapidly in popularity. From only 30 documented 
programs in 1987, by 1994-95 it had expanded to 182 schools in 10 states. Spanish is by far the 



O 

me 



46 



55 



predominant minority language used for instruction, followed by Korean, French, Navajo, 
Chinese, Arabic, Japanese, Russian, and Portuguese (Christian & Whitcher 1995). 



M. Title VII and Equal Opportunity 

The Congress finds that— 

(15) the Federal Government, as exemplified by title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and section 
204(f) of the Equal Education Opportunities Act of 1974, has a special and continuing obligation 
to ensure that States and local school districts take appropriate action to provide equal educational 
opportunities to children and youth of limited English proficiency; 



A substantial minority of LEP children — estimates range from 22 to 30 percent (Moss & 
Puma 1995; CDE 1995; Donly et al. 1995; CCSSO 1990) — receive no language assistance 
whatsoever. That is, as many as 1.1 million children, depending on which estimate of the LEP 
population one uses, may be receiving neither bilingual nor immersion nor ESL instruction. 30 The 
Supreme Court has ruled, in Lau v. Nichols (1974), that denial of special help to any LEP child 
is a violation of that child's civil rights. Schools must take "affirmative steps" to help students 
overcome language barriers impeding their access to the curriculum. This principle, codified in 
the Equal Educational Opportunity Act (EEOA) of 1974, has led courts to order numerous school 
districts to improve their services for LEP children (Jimenez 1992). 



Nevertheless, there remains considerable unevenness among states, districts, and schools 
in their commitment to meet this obligation. Some SEAs enforce state mandates to provide 
bilingual or ESL instruction to LEP students under varying conditions. Still, the major 
responsibility in civil rights enforcement rests with the U.S. Government. During the 1970s the 
federal Office for Civil Rights (OCR) aggressively monitored districts for compliance with the Lau 
decision and required nearly 500 to adopt "Lau Plans" — remedies for their past neglect of LEP 
students. During the 1980s OCR sharply reduced its Lau enforcement. 31 During the 1990s, as 
school reform presents new opportunities — and new dangers — for language-minority students 
(Crawford 1996b), vigorous efforts are still needed to safeguard their civil rights.

Fallacy: Bilingual education is a federal mandate imposed on states and localities , 32 



Under the Lau decision and the EEOA, a school district is free to adopt any approach in 
teaching LEP children, provided that it takes "appropriate action" to ensure their access to the 
curriculum. That is, the program must be (1) based on "a sound educational theory"; (2) 
"implemented effectively," with adequate staff and resources; and (3) evaluated, after a trial 
period, as effective in overcoming language barriers ( Castaneda v. Pickard 1981). 33 



To compete for federal grants under Title VII, local programs were once required to use 
some form of native-language instruction. But since 1984, a portion of such funding — currently 
25 percent — may go to support alternative, all-English approaches (P.L. 103-382, Sec. 7116). 



N. Capacity-Building for Language-Minority Education 

The Congress finds that— 

(16) the Federal Government also, as exemplified by the Federal Government's efforts under this 
title, has a special and continuing obligation to assist States and local school districts in 
developing the capacity to provide programs of instruction that offer limited English proficient 
children and youth an equal educational opportunity. 

Since 1968, the Bilingual Education Act has enabled thousands of schools to create, 
improve, and sustain instructional programs for LEP students. It has authorized grants to LEAs, 
not' as permanent subsidies, but as "seed money" to encourage innovative approaches that would 
become self-supporting. This capacity-building function has been one of Title VII's greatest 
successes. According to a recent national study, "A great majority of districts surveyed had been 
able to institutionalize many features of programs initiated with Title VII funding." These included 
the continuation of bilingual services after federal grants ran out, such as assessment procedures, 
instructional aides, and materials purchases; sustained support from parents, communities, 
administrators, and school boards; and permanent inservice training programs (Kim & Lucas 
1992). 



Title VII has also helped to disseminate exemplary models and practices through the 
Academic Excellence Grant Program. These include, for example, effective approaches to using 
educational technology, involving language-minority parents and communities, and integrating

Native American cultures into the curriculum. Since 1987, such program models have been 
adopted in an estimated 150 schools, 70 percent of which have reported positive impacts on 
student achievement (Wilson et al. 1994). 



The Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 maintains federal support for local capacity- 
building, but with a new emphasis. Congress recognized that, while Title VII is needed to foster 
innovative approaches in bilingual education, it cannot do the job alone. SEAs and LEAs must do 
more to coordinate services for LEP students throughout the full range of federal and state 
programs, including immigrant education, Indian education, special education, vocational 
education, migrant education, and — most important in financial terms — Title I. By and large, 
such programs have poorly addressed the needs of LEP students in the past. Although one-third 
of these children are "served" by Title I, this has often meant the same remedial instruction that 
was provided to underachieving, English-speaking children, according to a survey of SEA officials 
(CCSSO 1990). As for the language barrier, state and local administrators have tended to assume 
it was a "special problem" that the bilingual program was "taking care of." So they have rarely 
included LEP children in broader reform initiatives or coordinated efforts between Title I and Title 
VII (Strang & Carlson 1991). 



Language-minority students' lack of inclusion in educational planning has frequently 
resulted in a denial of equal opportunity. In a study of 27 secondary schools in California, for 
example, Minicucci and Olsen (1992) found that less than 25 percent offered "full [academic] 
programs for students learning English," while 13 provided "few or no content area classes" for 
LEP students. 



Under Title VII, as reauthorized in 1994, capacity-building means enabling school districts 
to serve LEP students — no longer in isolation, but in the context of efforts to ensure educational 
equity. Consistent with Goals 2000, the new law requires SEAs and LEAs to strive for the 
inclusion of language-minority concerns at all levels of school reform. While such efforts "hold 
promise for improving instruction and learning for all students," attention must be paid to the 
special situation of LEP students in such areas as standards, assessment, accountability, and 
educational research. Otherwise, "well-intentioned reforms could jeopardize a generation of 
progress" for these children (August et al. 1994).

III. Conclusion 



Federal policies on bilingual education, as articulated by the Congressional findings on 
Title VII, are well supported by scientific research. Such evidence becomes stronger each year. 
Certainly, much remains to be learned — for example, about how children acquire second 
languages, how social and cognitive variables affect the process, and how bilingualism interacts 
with literacy development and academic achievement. More basic research in these areas is 
necessary to improve the schooling of LEP children. At the same time, studies over the past three 
decades have laid a solid foundation for bilingual pedagogies. We know that native-language 
instruction supports — rather than retards — English acquisition, and that quality bilingual 
programs can help students meet high standards and cultivate valuable language skills. 

Nevertheless, Title VII continues to excite controversy. Bilingual education evokes a nexus 
of issues — civil rights, immigration policy, ethnic diversity, cultural pluralism, and national 
identity — that are among the most sensitive of our times. Though far removed from classroom 
realities, these political conflicts have too often shaped the discussion of language-minority 
education. Myths and misinformation tend to dominate this debate. Partisan condemnations are 
issued. Ideologues, not experts, command center stage. 

Porter (1996) describes bilingual education as "a panacea that failed." To the contrary, it 
is the quest for panaceas that has failed to produce consensus. Not all children learn in the same 
way, their needs are strikingly diverse. Limited English proficiency is but one among numerous 
factors - including poverty, family illiteracy, cultural barriers, and institutional racism - that 
account for underachievement. Thus doctrinaire cure-alls are ineffectual. Worse, they become a 
prescription for educational neglect, as LEP students long experienced in English-only schools. 

Since 1968, researchers have identified a variety of bilingual program models that have 
proven successful when adapted to diverse communities. They have also documented a range of 
effective practices in the bilingual classroom. Pedagogical experimentation is healthy, as Title VII 
has always recognized. Federal policy must be flexible enough to respect local preferences and 
to support innovation, while promoting the approaches that seem most promising — according to 
the best evidence available. Judged by this standard, the Congressional findings on the Bilingual 
Education Act signify an important advance.

Glossary 



Language-minority students — children in grades K-12 from homes where a language other than 
English is spoken. 

Limited-English-proficient (LEP) students — also known as English language learners; 
language-minority children who have difficulties in speaking, comprehending, reading, or writing 
English that affect their school performance (see Note 6). 



Teaching Methods 

Native-language instruction — use of a child's home language (generally by a classroom teacher) 
to provide lessons in academic subjects or to teach reading and other language arts. 

Native-language support — use of a child's home language (generally by a teacher's aide) to 
translate unfamiliar terms or otherwise clarify lessons taught in English. 

English as a second language (ESL) — also known as English language development (ELD); 
various approaches to teaching English, adapted to the needs of minority-language speakers, 
including: 

Grammar-based ESL — instruction in English that teaches about the language: its structure 
and vocabulary, typically stressing drills, translation, and conversational exercises. 

Communication-based ESL — teaching English by using the language in meaningful contexts; 
for example, the Natural Approach, which stresses simplified conversation and visual or 
physical cues to make English input comprehensible. 

Sheltered English — also known as content-based ESL or immersion; English-language 
instruction in content areas, adjusted to learners' level of second-language proficiency, 
enabling them to acquire academic English naturally as they learn academic content. 



Program Models 

Bilingual education — various models that use both English and native-language instruction to 
teach school subjects and that feature some form of ESL, including: 



Transitional bilingual education (TBE) — also known as early-exit bilingual education; a 

model whose primary goal is to "mainstream" students to all-English classrooms; uses native- 
language instruction to help students keep up in other subjects, but phases in English 
instruction as quickly as possible (see Note 21 ) . 

Developmental bilingual education (DBE) — also known as maintenance bilingual 
education; a model whose goals include fluent bilingualism as well as academic excellence; 
typically phases in English more gradually than TBE and continues to develop students' skills 
in the native language (through language arts or content-area instruction) after they have 
become fully English-proficient (see Note 21). 

Two-way bilingual education — also known as dual-language instruction or bilingual 
immersion; a model that combines DBE for language-minority students and foreign-language 
immersion for English-proficient students, with the added benefit of peer tutoring; seeks to 
enable each group to learn the other's vernacular while also meeting high academic standards 
(see Section U.J.). 

Immersion education — various models that use communication- and content-based approaches 
to teaching second languages, with little or no use of students' first language, including: 

Special alternative instructional program (SAIP) — also known as structured immersion 
or immersion strategy; a model in which language-minority, LEP children are taught 
primarily through sheltered English techniques, with the native language used — if at all — 
only for purposes of clarification (see Note 21); a subtractive approach that does not promote 
the development of bilingual skills. 

Foreign-language immersion — a model in which language-majority students are instructed 
primarily or exclusively through sheltered instruction in a second language, later combined 
with native-language classes; an additive approach whose goal is functional bilingualism at no 
cost to academic achievement (e.g., French immersion in Canada; see Section II. G.). 

Native-language immersion — a model in which Native American (or other indigenous) 
students are taught through sheltered instruction in an endangered language; promotes the 
goals of revitalizing a community's vernacular and strengthening students' cultural identity, 
while fostering academic achievement (see Section II. D). 

Submersion — also known as sink or swim; teaching LEP students in mainstream, English- 
language classrooms that offer no special language assistance; violates civil rights guarantees 
under the Supreme Court's Lau v. Nichols (1974) decision. 

ESL pullout — supplemental instruction for LEP children removed from submersion classrooms, 
typically for 30 to 45 minutes each day; usually provided by teachers who do not speak the native 
language of their students.

Notes 



1. The disparity is significant since, as other studies have determined, a majority of decision-makers rely 
on newspaper accounts for information on social science research (Weiss & Singer 1987, cited in 
McQuillan & Tse, in press). 

2. The census questions on language were part of the "long form" sent to a 12 percent sample of the U.S. 
population in 1980 and 1990. Respondents were asked: "Does this person speak a language other than 
English at home?" If so, "What language?" and "How well does this person speak English? — Very 
well? Well? Not well? or Not at all?" 

Unfortunately, these questions are open to various interpretations not intended by the Census 
Bureau, such as: "Can this person speak, at any level of proficiency, a language other than English?" 
or "Does this person ever speak another language at home?" Misunderstandings like these may tend 
to overstate the population of language minorities (e.g., a substantial minority of those who report 
speaking Spanish at home are of non-Hispanic background; perhaps they have studied the language in 
school). 

On the other hand, immigrants who marry monolingual English speakers often have no opportunity 
to speak their first language at home; if so, their native languages go uncounted. In addition, the home 
language questions require a degree of English literacy to answer, since the written form is mailed and 
no interviewer is present to explain the purpose of the questions. This may yield an undercount of 
limited-English speakers — e.g., among American Indians on reservations, where census forms tend 
to pile up, unanswered, at remote trading posts. 

Finally, self-reports of proficiency in both English and minority languages have been shown to be 
unreliable when compared with objective measures. For example, they may be "contaminated" by 
various feelings about ethnicity, such as pride in the native tongue or identification with the dominant 
culture (Hakuta & D'Andrea 1992). 

Since identical language questions were asked in 1980 and 1990, the responses can still be useful 
in plotting general trends. Unfortunately, no data about current usage of non-English languages were 
gathered in censuses from 1930 to 1970 (to the extent they were asked, questions focused on home 
languages spoken in childhood). Even English proficiency questions were sporadic during this period. 

3. In the 1982 English Language Proficiency Survey, conducted by the Census Bureau for the U.S. 
Department of Education, there was a strong correlation between persons whose English proficiency 
was limited and those who rated their English-speaking abilities in the three lowest categories: "well," 
"not well,” or "not at all" (Kominski 1989, cited in MacArthur 1993). 

4. One obvious pattern is that SEAs with substantial Native American enrollments (e.g., Montana) 
identify significantly more LEP children than the census. On the other hand, SEAs with small, 
primarily immigrant populations of language minorities (e.g., South Carolina) identify significantly 
fewer LEP children than the census (see Table III). 

It is also important to bear in mind that the census asks only about English-speflU/tg ability — not 
about reading, writing, or listening. Thus the LEP student population is likely to be larger than the 
number of language-minority youth who report difficulty with English. Taking into account the 
percentages of this population that scored at the 20th and 40th percentile in reading, Waggoner (1993a) 
estimates a national LEP enrollment of 5 million to 7.5 million.

5. The Department of Education has never developed detailed standards on how schools should assess 
children's language proficiency. The statutory definition is as follows: 

The terms 'limited English proficiency' and 'limited English proficient’, when used with reference 
to an individual, mean an individual— 

(A) who— 

(I) was not born in the United States or whose native language is a language other than English 
and comes from an environment where a language other than English is dominant; or 

(ii) is a Native American or Alaska Native or who is a native resident of the outlying areas and 
comes from an environment where a language other than English has had a significant impact on 
such individual's level of English language proficiency; or 

(iii) is migratory and whose native language is other than English and comes from an 
environment where a language other than English is dominant; and 
(B) who has sufficient difficulty speaking, reading, writing, or understanding the English 
language and whose difficulties may deny such individual the opportunity to learn successfully in 
classrooms where the language of instruction is English or to participate fully in our society [P.L. 
103-382, Sec. 7501], 

6. See, e.g., Chavez (1991): "The purpose [of bilingual education] is not to assimilate Hispanic children, 
however, but to maintain and strengthen their ethnic identity by teaching them in their native language 
and by inculcating in them their native culture. In the process, these children have become the most 
segregated students in American public schools, kept apart from their English-speaking peers even after 
they have acquired basic English skills, sometimes for years." 

7. E.g., these include Hawaiian Creole English, or "Pidgin," as well as varieties of American Indian 
English. 

8. For FY1996 and FY1997, however, Congress declined to appropriate any funds for professional 
development. 

9. One explanation for the low rate of graduation among doctoral candidates is that Title VII fellowships 
are awarded for a maximum of three years, while the average doctoral degree in education takes 8.3 
years to complete (MayaTech 1991). 

10. See, e.g., Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Calif.): "Under these doctrinaire and disruptive bilingual policies, 
in too many U.S. schools children who wish to learn English are given only a few minutes of English 
instruction each day. Ignoring the time-tested wisdom that practice makes perfect, children are taught 
all day long in the foreign language they already speak, rather than in English" {Congressional Record, 
Aug. 1, 1996, p. H9751). 

11. See, e.g., Rep. Bill Emerson (R-Mo.): "The goal of bilingual education was and is to help children 
become fluent in English as quickly as possible. For example, while I recognize that there is a 
transition period whereby children need time to learn English, I do not agree with some educators and 
policymakers about the length of the transition period — which some believe should last as long as 8 
years. Bilingual education was enacted because Congress wants limited English proficient students to 
quickly learn English and move on" {Congressional Record, March 21, 1994, p. H 171 1). 




56 

63 



12. See, e.g.. House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.): "[A]sk yourself, in an America where their are over 
80 languages taught in the California schools as the primary language, not as the secondary language 
but as the primary language, in a country where in Seattle there are 75 languages being taught, in 
Chicago there are 100; this is not bilingualism, this is a level of confusion which if it were allowed to 
develop for another 20 or 30 years would literally lead, I think, to the decay of the core parts of our 
civilization" {Congressional Record, Aug. 1, 1996, p. H9768). 

13. See, e.g., Rep. Joe Knollenberg (R-Mich.): "By teaching young people in their native languages, we 
are handicapping their performance in a highly competitive arena. Bilingual education may make the 
school day easier for children speaking English as a second language. However, it creates another class 
of student unable to read, speak, and write English in an English-speaking society" {Congressional 
Record, March 21, 1994, p. H1716). 

14. The remaining 12.6 percent supported various other Part A programs, including Family English 
Literacy, Academic Excellence, and Special Populations grants. Figures are drawn from information 
provided by OBEMLA to the House Appropriations Committee for FY1985 through FY1992. 



15. See, e.g., Rep. Toby Roth (R-Wisc.): "Mr. Speaker, much has been said this morning about education 
and wasting of money. We spend some $12 billion a year in this country, $12 billion a year on 
bilingual education, which means we teach kids in other than the English language" {Congressional 
Record, March 13, 1996, p. H2127). 

16. Reliable estimates are available for the number of LEP children enrolled in Title VII, Part A, 
classrooms — e.g., 349,500 in 1993 (Planning and Evaluation Service 1995). But these federally 
funded programs, both bilingual and alternative, serve only 10-15 percent of LEP students nationwide. 

17. If the nation did indeed spend $12 billion a year on these students — an amount equivalent to average 
per pupil expenditures — the marginal cost of special language programs would be zero. That is, they 
would cost no more than placing children in mainstream classrooms. 

18. Because this was not a random sample, the results are not "generalizable" to all programs for LEP 
students. Nevertheless, the cost differentials are instructive. 



19. See, e.g., U.S. News & World Report: "What all these problems [with bilingual programs] add up to 
is impossible to say precisely, but one statistic is hard to ignore. The high-school dropout rate for 
Hispanic students is nearly 30 percent. It remains by far the highest of any ethnic group — four times 
that of whites, three times that of blacks — and it has not budged since bilingual education began" 
(Sept. 25, 1995, p. 46). 

20. The early-exit programs used English two-thirds of the time in kindergarten, three-fourths of the time 
in 1st grade, and virtually all the time by 4th grade. The late-exit programs used English less than 10 
percent of the time in kindergarten, 33 percent in 2nd grade, and 60 percent in grades 4 through 6. 
Finally, the immersion programs used English 94 to 98 percent of the time, with Spanish used only for 
purposes of clarification (Ramirez et al. 1991). 

21. For a helpful summary of the Ramirez study and its implications, see Dolson & Mayer 1992.

22. This study applied meta-analysis to an earlier narrative review by Baker and de Kanter (1981), which 
— after disqualifying most studies — yielded negative findings about the effectiveness of bilingual 
instruction. Willig (1985) re-analyzed the same body of research, while statistically controlling for 
numerous variables that Baker and de Kanter had failed to consider. This meta-analysis found mean 
"effect sizes" favoring bilingual education over submersion. Perhaps more important, Willig 
determined that the better the quality of the study, the better the outcome for bilingual programs. 

23. Testifying in a civil-rights lawsuit, Rossell described her 1988 study of LEP student performance in 
the Berkeley, Calif., schools, which judged the district's ESL program superior to its bilingual 
education program (Rossell 1990). But she could provide few pedagogical details. Rossell conceded 
that her conclusions were based on (1) three minutes of classroom observation, (2) brief conversations 
with teachers, and (3) a partial comparison of test results for about 20 percent of the district’s LEP 
students ( Teresa P. v. Berkeley Unified School District, Case No. C-87-2396-DU [N.D. Calif. 1989], 
trial transcript, pp. 12-2074, 2075). 

24. The review cites only one such reference in the published literature — Gersten (1985) — a study 
involving only 28 immersion students and 16 bilingual students that has drawn sharp criticism from 
several quarters (see, e.g., Krashen 1996; Cummins 1988). 

25. Rossell and Baker (1996) portray themselves as victims of a politicized "atmosphere in which it is 
difficult for anyone to criticize current policy in this field" without being regarded as racist. Guilt over 
the historic abuse of language minority students, they speculate, has encouraged many bilingual 
education researchers and practitioners to view "any policy which maintains the mother tongue, 
however inadequately, fas] equitable" (pp. 9-10). Yet they provide no evidence of such ideological bias 
among those with whom they disagree. Nor do they acknowledge the conservative agenda of the 
organization that has supported their own work, the Pioneer Institute for Public Policy Research. 

26. One problem is that 94 percent of college students and 98 percent of high school students study just 
three modern languages: French, Spanish, and German (Brecht & Walton 1994). 

27. These are among several studies in volume 16 of The Journal of Educational Issues of Language 
Minority Students, a special issue on parent involvement (Summer 1996). 

28. E.g., in a 1985 survey, 98 percent of Hispanics in Dade County, Florida, said that it was essential for 
their children to "speak and write English perfectly," compared with only 94 percent of Anglo parents 
(cited in Crawford 1992). 

29. In 1992, only 25 percent of LEP students were assessed in grade 4, 33 percent in grade 8, and 50 
percent in grade 12. In 1994, these proportions increased to 50 percent, 50 percent, and 66 percent, 
respectively. Since 1995, NAEP has been working on ways to increase the percentage of LEP students 
assessed, developing new inclusion criteria and test adaptations that can gauge children’s progress in 
valid and reliable ways. But field tests indicate that results for LEP students assessed with nonstandard 
procedures in 1996 will not be comparable to results for other students (Olson & Goldstein 1996). 

30. When LEAs and schools were surveyed directly, they reported that only about 3 percent of LEP 
students went unserved; for an additional 9 percent, no information about instructional treatment was 
provided (Fleischman & Hopstock 1993). But SEAs tell a different story. In a survey by the Council 




58 

G5 



of Chief State School Officers, an average of 29 percent of LEP children received no language 
assistance in 32 responding states. In four states, more than 60 percent went unserved, and in one, 100 
percent (CCSSO 1990). 

31. Between 1981 and 1985, school districts were nine times less likely to be monitored for Lau 
compliance than between 1975 and 1980. OCR's Lau enforcement continued to decline until 1993, 
although precise figures are unavailable (Crawford 1995). 

32. See, e.g., Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.): "[W]hat laws we have passed, what regulations we have 
passed in this body, end up mandating, end up forcing, local schools to adopt bilingual education 
programs whether they want it or not, and it costs them a lot of money" ( Congressional Record, March 
21, 1994, p. H1717). 

33. OCR has adopted the Castaneda standard, from a 1981 ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals, as part of its Lau enforcement policy.
