SPANISH BOOKS AND SOURCES 
RECOMMENDED FOR 

SPANISH SPEAKING CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS 



Libros de Ciencia 
en Espanol 

Consider these science trade books recommended for 
Spanish-speaking students. 

By Isabel Schon 



S panish-speaking chil- 
dren of all ages can learn 
about the world of science 
and technology through a 
wonderful variety of well- 
written, well-designed 
books. In contrast to those published 
just a few years ago, books available 
today will delight teachers, parents, 
and librarians as well as Spanish- 
speaking scientists-to-be. These books 
compare in reader appeal and physi- 
cal format to ones long available in 
English. 

As a guide for teachers and librar- 
ians, the selection that follows lists 
' recent, noteworthy Spanish-language 
books in science. I have provided a 
tentative grade level for each series, 
but the individual student’s Spanish 
reading ability, interest, and purpose 
will determine the appropriate level 
more accurately.

at the seashore, in the mountains, and in 
the countryside — gathering, conserving, or 
collecting leaves, algae, feathers, and min- 
erals. The only weakness of this otherwise 
outstanding guide are several awkward il- 
lustrations that are more condescending 
than cute.

the lighthearted tale.

oasis is growing smaller and her people are 
disappearing because they have forgotten the 
songs of their ancestors. The story is set in the 
beautiful Sonora Desert and illustrated with 
photographs of colorful woven tapestries that 
give this bilingual (English/Spanish) story a 
mythlike quality. The original Spanish text is a 
special pleasure.

Gr. 2-4. As a simple introduction in Spanish to math and science 
terms, this series might be useful, but the simplistic albeit cheerful 
cartoons add little to the readers’ understanding of the terms. The 
Spanish definitions are, with a few exceptions, understandable — 
. especially if explained by a helpful adult. Several typos and awkward 
sentences as well as a dumsy. literal translation of the introductions 
detract from the value of the series.

Gr. 1-2. Including full-color photographs and simple texts, like 
previous titles in this series, these six books introduce readers to the 
five sensesand the importance ofthe sun. Despite their small sue — 6 
1/4 inches by 7 1/4 inches — and generally monotonous tone, these 
science books for the very young will be welcomed by Spanish- 
speakers. 

Freeman, Don. Un bolsillo para Corduroy (A Pocket for Corduroy). 
1992. 32p. illus. Viking. $12 (0-670-64483-7). 

PreschooMC Spanish-speaking fans of the popular Corduroy will 
be satisfied with this lively Spanish translation. The full-color 
illustrations of the appealingly portrayed stalwart bear who wants a 
pocket for himself are the best part of the story. 

HeUer, Ruth. Las galinas no son las unicas (Chickens Aren’t the 
Only Ones). Tr. by Alma Flor Ada. Grosset & Dunlap. $10,95 
(0-448-40586-5). 

Gr. K-2. Like the original English version, first published in 1981. 
this festive science lesson for young Spanish -speaking readers with 
buoyant but realistic full-color drawings explains that it’s not only 
chickens who lay eggs. The well-done Spanish translation is just right 
forsdentists-to-beas well asyoungsters eager to read or hear about 
otheranimals and theireggs.

(0-945354-34-7): paper, $6.95 (0-945354-33-9). 

Gr. 2-4. The purpose of this bilingual (English-Spanish) story is to 
help children and their parents to feel more familiar with the 
therapeutic process. Through Tanya's continuing fear of the Tobo 
Man, readers are exposed to her mother's apprehensions, visits to a 
therapist, and the happy results. The black-and-white drawings of a 
black mother and her daughter are realistic and appropriate. The 
Spanish translation isadequate though marred by four typographical 
mistakes.

Gr. 1-3. This warm story about the immigration period of the late 
1 800s has been ably translated into Spanish. The gentle illustrations • 
depicting the old-fashioned ambience will charm and inform 
Spanish-speakers unfamiliar with this period in American history. 

Madina veltla, Horaclo. La gran aventura de Don Roberto (Sir 
Roberto's Little Outing). 1991. 29p. W. W. Publishers, $13 95 
(1-879567-02-4). 

Gr. 3-5. Don Roberto, an unconventional and brave knight, sets out 
in search of adventure. In his spedal way, he defeats the fearsome 
dragon, saves the kingdom, marries the beautiful princess and 
returns home where he and his princess live happily ever after. The 



three-tone, humorous, albeit tiny illustrations are a beautiful 
complement to the slightly ironic story of chivalry and courage. 
Unfortunately, the "conversation pieces" — questions framed to help 
readers express their own thoughts about the themes and issues 
explored in the story — are unnecessary at best and may encourage 
well-meaning adults to turn the story into a deadly lesson about 
courage, friendship, teamwork, and other noble topics. 

Mis primeros conoclmientos (My First Knowledge). IOv. 1989. 
Grolier International. $149 (968-3 3 -05 2 7-X). 

Gr. 4-7. Originally published in English by Franklin Watts, this series 
is a collection of high-interest topics that should appeal to students 
in the middle grades. The excellent Spanish translation (done by 
Editorial Cumbre in Mexico City) is easy to read and to understand. In 
addition, numerous full-color illustrations add interest toeach topic 
Subjects include: pets, transportation, aquatic animals, astronomy, 
computers, selected sports, volcanoes, earthquakes, dinosaurs, and 
serpents. As an overview to these topics, the series is definitely 
worthwhile. This is not, however, a science and nature encyclopedia, 
asstatedinthe publisher’s catalog. 

Roe, Eileen, illus. by CasiUa, Robert Con Mi Hermano (With My 
Brother). 1991. 32p. Bradbury. Si 2.95 (0-02-777373-6). 

Gr.K-2. In a simple bilingual (English/Spanish) text, a little boy tells 
why he admires his brother and aspires to be like him. The bold 
watercolor illustrations of two Latino boys beautifully capture the 
spedal relationship between the two brothers. It must be noted, 
however, that even though this is a relatively good Spanish transla- 
tion. the bilingual format (English and Spanish sentences on the 
same page) definitely has a negative effect on one language. In this 
case the Spanish version, a copy of the English, loses the language's 
beautyand natural rhythm. In addition, an unfortunate typo ina book 
with very few sentences in Spanish really stands out. 

Ryan, Elizabeth A Hablemos franca mente de las drogas y el 
alcohol (Straight Talk about Drugs and Alcohol). 1990. 152p. Facts 
On File, $16.95 (0-8160-2496-0). 

Gr. 7-12. In a candid and easy-to-understand manner, the author 
discusses the physical and social effects of drug and alcohol abuse, 
how to recognize an addiction, and how to get help for a dependency 
problem. Adolescents will especially appreciate the author's efforts 
toavoid lecturing on the evils of these substances and yet present the 
facts so that readers can reflect and make their own decisions. An 
excellent translation of a useful and timely book. 

Santiago Nodar, Carmen. Illus. by Paterson. Diane. El parafsode 
abuelita (Abuelita’s Paradise). Tr. by Teresa Mlawer. 1992. 32p. 
Whitman. SI 3.95 (0-8075-6346-3). 

Gr. K-3. Marita tenderly and lovingly reminisces about her 
grandmother and her descriptions of life in beautiful, rural Puerto 
Rico, Lush watercolor illustrations of a little girl and her family 
enjoying life in a pastoral Puerto Rican setting and a simple, fluid 
Spanish text will make this story a favorite of Puerto Rican families 
who long for abuelita’s paradise. 

Shulevitz, UrL El tesoro (The Treasure). Tr. by Maria Negioni. 1991. 
32p. illus. Fanar/Mirasol, $ 1 6 (0-374-37422-8). 

Gr. 1-3, Shulevitz's time-honored folktale about a poor old man who 
finds treasure in his own home after a dream directs him to look 
elsewhere has been appropriately translated into Spanish. The 
illustrations, full ofwell-modulated color and striking light use, are as 
captivating as the originals. 

Singer, Isaac Bashevis. Illus. by Carie, Eric. Por qu6 No6 eligid la 
paloma (Why Noah Chose the Dove). Tr. by Afda E. Marcuse. 1991. 
32p. Farrar/Mirasol, $16 (0-374-36085-5). 

Gr. K-2. Spanish-speakers will enjoy this exquisite translation of 
Singer's story of why Noah chose the modest dove as his messenger. 
Carle's expansive, full-color illustrations — stiff, cutout-style figures 
that romp gaily to the edges of each big page — are as charming as the 
originals.

Zelinsky, Paul O. El enano saltarfn. cuento de los Hermanos Grimm 
(Rumpel stiltskin). 1992. 38p. illus. Dutton. SI 5 (0-525-44903*5). 

Gr. K-2. Zelinsky's exquisite artistic interpretation of the Grimms' tale 
about a miller's daughter who gets unexpected help from a gnomelike 
little man in turning hay into gold thread can now be enjoyed by 
Spanish-speaking youngsters in the U.S. The direct, easy-to-read 
Spanish text, translated in Spain in 1987. is a real joy to listen to or to 
read. However. Spanish-speakers in the U.S. might object to one 
peninsular Spanish conjugation, Imaginad. Although recognizable, this 
inflected verbal form sounds old-fashioned to Spanish-speakers from 
Latin America and the U.S. This minor caveat is certainly not meant to 
deter the enjoyment of this wonderful adaptation with jeweled tones 
and museum-quality illustrations.

Gr. K-3. The immensely satisfying tale of a rabbi's response to a 
poor man’s complaint about his terrible life is now available to 
Spanish-speaking readers with Zemach’s original zesty. action-pack- 
ed illustrations with their strong colors and careful composition. It 
must be noted that in this otherwise fluid Spanish translation, young 
Spanish-speaking readers will be confused by the regionalism como 
ser. uno a dos polios. This usage is too dialect-specific; such 
regionalisms fail to communicate to larger audiences of Spanish- 
speakers. (See Diccionario de dudus y difteuluides de la lenguc i espanola by 
Manuel Seco. EspasaCalpe. 1986. p. 106,) 



Nonrecommended Titles 

It Is wonderful to see the new interest of U.S. publishers in publishing 
books in Spanish for young readers. However, as I noted in a previous 
column [BKL la 1 92\, there are still major inadequacies in many of these 
books. My plea, one more time, is to urge U.S. publishers to take a serious, 
in-depth look into their translating/publishing efforts. Obviously. U.S. 
publishers know how to serve the reading needs of young English-speak- 
ing readers. And. they are trying to serve the needs of Spanish-speakers. 
But. to do so. they've got to pay attention to what they are doing with their 
books in Spanish. The following inexcusably inferior recently published 
books are not recommended. 

Bailey, Donna. Las^guilas (Eagles). (0-81 14-2660-2). 

Bailey, Donna. Los delfines (Dolphins). (0-81 14-2656-4).

Ea. v.: illus. by Chasty, Paula. 1 992. 33p. Steck-Vaughn. $ 1 1 .95. 

Gr. 3-5. Numerous vocabulary and grammatical mistakes in every book 
mar these literal translations. The original English version was published 
by Hein emann Children's Reference in 1991. 

Carie, Eric La mariquita malhumorada (The Grouchy Ladybug). Tr. by

(0-06-020549-0); paper. $5.95 (0-06-443301-3). 

Ages 5-8. Carle’s bold watercolor illustrations of a grouchy ladybug who 
Is looking for a fight are the best part of this story. The Spanish translation, 
however, leaves much to be desired: it indudes words not in general use 
as well as dumsy sentence constructions and two incredible spelling 
mistakes. (It is important to note that as bad as this Spanish translation 
is. It Is not as bad as that of another Carle book, la oruga mug hambrienta 
17k Very Hungry Caterpillar}]. 

Harvey, Bob and Harvey, Diane Kelsay. Illus. by Johnson, Carol A 
loumey of Hope/Una jomada de esperanza. 1991 . 42p. Beautiful 
America Publishing Company. $12.95 (0-89802 h503-2). 

Gr. 3-5. The obvious purpose of this bilingual ‘story" Is to help turtles 
"climb out of their nests of sand and make the long journey to the sea. 
Forever." So. through Hope, a Ridley sea turtle, children learn about ‘a 
journey of hope." The only commendable aspects of this ‘journey" are the 
outstanding dear photographs and drawings of a tu rtle at sea. The English 
text Is schmaltzy at best The Spanish translation can be used as an 
example of how not to translate bilingual books: it is a literal translation 
of the English version, hence it lacks the richness and fluidity of the 
Spanish language. In addition. It has misaccen ted words, grammatical and 
spelling mistakes, anglidsms, and other barbarisms. 

Keats, Ezra fade Silba por Willie (Whistle for Willie). 1992. 32p. illus. 
VikJng, $14 (£>-670-84395-4). 

Ages 3-7. A most unfortunate incorrect literal translation into Spanish 
In the only sentence on the first page of the amusing story about Peter, 
he small boy who longs to be able to whistle for his dog. Willie, will 



disappoint and confuse Spanish-speakers. Like the original English ver- 
sion, first published in 1964. the colorful illustrations include bits of 
patterned paper to supplement Keats' joyous paintings. It should be noted 
that even the book's Spanish title is absurd: S ilha por Willie means "You 
Whistle Instead of Willie." which doesn t make any sense. What a misfor- 
tune for young Spanish-speakers!

Ages 2-5. Only parents desperate for bilingual (Engiisfv5panish) bocks 
for their little ones will be interested in these tin'/ — 5-by*5-inch — board 
books. The insipid, lifeless illustrations are. at times, difficult to figure out 
and will confuse young learners. In addition, misspelled words and the 
use of regionalisms — bodega . chomra. guinea — as opposed to standard 
Spanish words will make it even more difficult for those learning the 
Spanish language. The sloppy translation is also evident in the occasional 
use of articles, which are indeed important in Spanish.

Ea. v.: Tr. from the Spanish by Lori Ann Schatschneider. 1992. 24p.

Gr. 1—4. What an incredible disappointment! Originally published in 
Spain, these were fun-filled books with tiny, delightful, colorful full-page 
spreads and enjoyable Spanish texts in vtfuch lovers of detail are en- 
couraged to search for David, his two friends, and other objects. Unfor- 
tunately. however, these U.S. editions have "adapted" the original, fluid, 
amusing, well-written, rich Spanish texts into stale, incorrect, awkward, 
and generally inferior Spanish ones that are full of grammatical, usage, 
and other mistakes. It appears that the only reason for this U.S. "adapta- 
tion" is to facilitate the dull English translation. 

My First 100 Words In Spanish and EngQsh/Mls prim eras palabras en 
espanol e Ingles. 1992. 12p. Simon & Schuster, $1 1 (0-671 -74965 -X). 

Ages 4-7. Through this illustrated, bilingual "pul!-the-tab" book, children 
ostensibly will leam words in English and Spanish used in the farm, store, 
.park, town, and home. The idea and physical presentation of this book are 
outstanding. However, it includes so many obsolete, nonstandard, and 
misspelled words in Spanish that it is best to find other means to expose 
children to their "first 100 words in Spanish" (It is interesting to note that 
no such problems appear In the English words).

Mexico 



by Isabel 5 cfton 



A lthough Mexico shares a 
2,000-mile border with the 
United States, in the minds 
Land hearts of many 
Americans it is far away. Our southern 



neighbors are often misunderstood, 
slighted, or ignored. Stereotyped views 
of the people as lazy and im- 
poverished prevail, and the country is 
often considered useless except as a 
vacation spot. This problem is compli- 
cated by the fact that for many years 
too few books were written about 
Mexico, and those that were published 
too often gave a limited or one-sided 
view of the country. This situation, for- 
tunately, is changing; in recent years 
the number of good books has in- 
creased. Listed here are some high- 
quality selections that can introduce 
young readers to the broad panorama 
of Mexico: its beauty, variety, and joy 
as well as its sad realities, past and 
present.
