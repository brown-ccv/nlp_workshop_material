NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PREVENTION AND 
INTERVENTIONS IN YOUTH SUICIDE 



INTRODUCTION 

Since the mid-1950s, fundamental and im- 
portant changes occurred in suicide patterns 
in the United States. Suicide rates among 
older persons decreased while rates for 
young persons between ages 15 to 24 nearly 
tripled. Between 1970 and 1985, ap- 
proximately 75,000 young people took their 
own lives. Beginning in 1980, more than half 
of all suicides occurred among persons less 
than 40 years old. The taking of one's own 
life is now the second leading cause of death 
among those ages 15 to 24 and is one of the 
leading causes of pi emature death-200,000 
potential years of life are lost annually be- 
cause of suicide. Miite males account for 
the preponderance of all suicides and more 
males are using guns to commit suicide. 

Suicide among the young was recognized as 
a public health issue of national importance 
when the nation's health priorities were reor- 
dered in 1979. The Surgeon General's 
report. Healthy People .called for reducing the 
suicide rate among persons 15 to 24 from 12.4 
per 100,000 (in 1978) to 11 per 100,000 by 
1990. 

The Secretary's Task Force on Youth 
Suicide was established as a response to the 
public demand for action to end these tragic 
events. It was charged with the responsibility 
for coordinating suicide activities among 
various Federal agencies. Congress, State 
and local governments, private agencies, and 
professional organizations. Its major func- 
tions are to assess and consolidate informa- 
tion on suicide, to provide a forum for 
communication among health care 
providers, educators, social service profes- 



sionals, and families; and to recommend and 
initiate activities to address the problem. 
The ultimate goal of this task force is to for- 
mulate a national plan comprised of research 
activities, educational efforts, and health ser- 
vices involving the public and private sector 
in efforts to reduce youth suicide. 

NATIONAL CONFERENCES 

The Task Force on Youth Suicide sponsored 
a series of national conferences which served 
as forums for exchanging the most up-to-date 
information on risk factors and preventive 
strategies. The first of the conferences made 
clear that while each suicide is different, a 
complex interplay of characteristics, or risk 
factors, contribute to suicide in general and 
youth suicide in particular; these contribut- 
ing factors are complex, often interrelated, 
and only partially understood. 

Indicators of risk include, but are not limited 
to, the presence of psychiatric disorders such 
as depression or schizophrenia, parental loss 
and family disruption, being abused or 
neglected, being a friend or family member 
of a suicide victim, having genetic or 
biochemical factors (such as elevated 
serotonin or 5-HIAA levels), sexual identity 
problems, being a runaway, having a family 
with a history of substance abuse, having an 
unwanted pregnancy, suffering a humiliation 
or perceived humiliation, and having a 
propensity toward impulsive and aggressive 
behavior. Alcohol and drug abuse often 
complicates and sometimes precipitates 
suicidal behavior. Cultural pressures and

socioeconomic variables also contribute to 
suicide among minority youth. 

Conference on Prevention and 
Interventions in Youth Suicide 

In June 1986, a national conference was held 
in Oakland, California to review the current 
state of knowledge in suicide prevention ac- 
tivities and intervention strategies. Par- 
ticipants in the conference included persons 
in many disciplines who work with troubled 
youth: researchers who study suicide; 
professionals in mental health, medicine, 
education, and social work; representatives 
of national and professional organizations, 
representatives of community-based service 
programs, including volunteers, civic and 
religious leaders, parents, and others who 
work at the front lines of prevention 
programs. 

The papers and research studies presented at 
the conference addressed intervention 
strategies on several levels— primary and 
secondary prevention, community-level 
health and social services, the role of volun- 
teers in suicide prevention, school-based 
education, interventions for special popula- 
tions, early detection and treatment for 
suicidal adolescents, and federally supported 
research and demonstration centers. Issues 
relating to the effectiveness of prevention ac- 
tivities were thoroughly aired. The value of 
the conference was expanded by frequent 
open discussion periods and review panels 
that critiqued the presentatioas. 

Many recommendations for intervention and 
evaluation approaches made by repre- 
sentatives of public and private interests have 
been integrated into the task force's recom- 
mendations to the Secretary; many more sug- 
gestions are included in the commissioned 
papers contained in this volume. 

For many years, research into suicide con- 
centrated on the well established relation- 
ship between suicide and psychiatric 
disorders in adults, usually white males over 
the age of 40. Intervention and prevention 
efforts generally involved the detection and 



treatment of mental illness, most commonly 
depression. Recent research, however, sug- 
gests that among the young, the patterns of 
suicide differ finom the traditional picture; 
only a portion of young people who commit 
suicide are known to have a diagnosable 
mental disorder. Mapy investigators now 
believe that treatment modes used for adults 
(e.g., treating depression) will not be effec- 
tive with young people and that conclusions 
drawn from research on adults cannot be 
generalized to youth. 

From the conference on risk factors, we 
learned that a multiplicity of factors con- 
tribute to a young person's decision to end 
his or her life, and from the conference on 
prevention and interventions that no single 
therapeutic model is ideal to combat the 
problem; multiple interventions arc neces- 
sary. Clearly, we need to know a great deal 
more about the usefulness and effectiveness 
of interventions. Good epidemiologic data 
on suicides will help in identifying risk factors 
and in planning prevention and intervention 
approaches targeted to specific needs in the 
populations at risk. We need to evaluate 
carefully the service's now in use and to 
develop well-planucJ interventions that in- 
clude rigorous analyses and interpretation of 
results. 

The participants in the conference believe 
that the precursors to suicide can be treated 
and that many potential suicides can be 
redirected toward alternate, life-sustaining 
choices. Success \^ill require the combined 
efforts of all sectors of society: parents, peers, 
and caring people; and professionals in the 
fields of health, education, social and mental 
health services, collaborating to prevent a 
broad range of self-destructive behaviors in 
youth. 

CONFERENCE SUMMARY 

Suicide is a rare phenomenon, affecting 
about 1 out of 10,000 people. Most of our 
knowledge about the causes and prevention 
of suicide is based on relatively few cases. 
Research projects studying young people

are, with a few exceptions, poorly designed, 
lack adequate compantion groups cr realistic 
outcome measures, and often involve too few 
subjects to be considered statistically sig- 
nificant 

A strategy for prevention of youthful suicidal 
behavior must reconcile two points of view. 
One view sees completed suicides as the cul- 
mination of processes that begin with some 
problem early in life-educational, be- 
havioral, family, psychosocial, physical-and 
progress along a continuum of suicidal 
thoughts, attempts, and finally successful 
suicide. Many of these young people are 
highly vulnerable to the stresses of life and 
they are unable or refuse to adapt to life con- 
ditions. Inability to cope with these problems 
may be predictive of a number of self destruc- 
tive behaviors, including suicide threats, at- 
tempts, and completions. 

The other point of view characterizes at- 
tempted suicides and completed suicides as 
distinct but overlapping entities. An es- 
timated 25 to 40 percent of those who com- 
plete suicide are known to have made a 
previous attempt. 

A prevention effort for the former entails a 
broad-based primaiy intervention at early 
points along the continuum, while the latter 
group requires an approach tailored to a 
smaller group of individuals whose charac- 
teristics or specific problems place them at 
high risk for suicide. A prevention program 
targeted only to those with demonstrable risk 
factors may miss reaching some potentially 
suicidal individuals in the larger population; 
on the other hand, a broad-baseid effort re- 
quires a large cohort, but one in which low 
risk individuals may be strengthened while 
helping those who need to be helped. 

Primary prevention in youth suicide 

The concept of primaiy prevention dictates 
that preventive efforts, grounded in a sound 
knowledge base, be administered before 
signs of a condition or problem develop. For 
suicide, this refers to any intervention that 
reduces the possibility of suicide by an 



r 



adolescent. Because the pathways that led to 
suicide are so varied, the issue of when to 
apply primary prevention may become a 
problem. For example, should efforts be in- 
stituted when a specific disorder identified 
with suicide appeals? Or, should efforts 
begin when risk factors appear, such as early 
trauma, sexual identity problems, drug 
problems, or negative social behavior? 

Dr. Felner (see paper, this volume) avers that 
youth suicide is part of a developmental pat- 
tern of general emotional and behavioral 
problems related to stress, including depres- 
sion, acting out problems, risk-taking and 
other self-destr.ctive behaviors such as al- 
cohol and substance abuse, confounded by 
the intentional, perhaps impulsive, use of 
lethal means. 

A broad-based primaiy prevention model as 
proposed by Dr. Felner involves two 
strategies. One strategy would be devoted to 
modifying social systems in which youth func- 
tion in ways that make the youngsters' en- 
vironment less difficult to adapt to. Making 
the school environment less anxiety-produc- 
ing, for example, might affect the mental 
health and well-being of individuals such that 
stress is reduced and life opportunities are in- 
creased. The second strategy seeks to help 
youths develop skills that enable them feel 
better about themselves and less anxious 
about the future. Enhancing young persons' 
problemsolving, decisionmaking, and coping 
skills through educational programs and sup- 
port networks are examples that might equip 
youngsters to function better in their en- 
vironment. 

While broad-based prevention programs re- 
quire exposing a very large population of 
children to a "treatment," reducing suicide is 
not the only expected outcome. Numerous 
beneficial effects are possible with this ap- 
proach that may generate better mental 
health even among persons at low risk for 
suicide including enhancing self-esteem, 
reducing school failure, increasing the sense 
of control young people have over their fu- 
ture, and reducing depression and a range of 
other health-related risky behaviors in 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



adolescents. 

The effects of primary prevention are hard to 
isolate from other variables that may in- 
fluence a potential suicide. Few data, no es- 
tablished models or sound evidence suggest 
that a broad-based primary prevention ap- 
proach would be effective in reducing suicide 
among young people. Before proceeding 
with such a costly effort, models confirming 
the benefits of such programs need to be 
tested and evaluated. 

Overview of prevention activities 

Opinions of scientists in the Held vary regard- 
ing the relationship between suicide at- 
tempters and completers. Data on 
unsuccessful suicide attempts are skimpy and 
uncertain, and it is not clear to what extent 
the psychological problems of attempters 
resemble those of completers. Nevertheless, 
it seems prudent to regard any suicidal be- 
havior as presaging completion. In his 
review, therefore. Dr. Shaffer addressed a 
wide range of primary and secondary preven- 
tion activities (See Shaffer, this volume). 
The primary prevention activities critiqued 
by Dr. Shaffer include providing psychiatric 
care to vulnerable groups; increasing sen- 
sitivity of school personnel to the characteris- 
tics of the suicide-prone child, and providing 
slcills for teachers, counselors, and other 
pupils to use when they identify a child at risk; 
providing information on suicidal behaviors 
to school children; encouraging students to 
talk about their suicidal thoughts; suggesting 
referrals to students suspected to be at risk; 
and intervening early and treating conditions 
which are known to predispose toward 
suicide. 

Secondary prevention encompasses ac- 
tivities directed toward preventing comple- 
tion of suicide among persons who have 
already threatened or attempted suicide. 
Approaches include psychological treatment 
for suicidal individuals, providing emergency 
crisis intervention at times of maximal stress 
(including crisis centers and telephone hot- 
lines for counseling and referral), and ongo- 
ing treatment after the crisis has passed. 



Identifying suicidal youth througti 
psyciiological autopsies 

The psychological autopsy is a method used 
by investigators to obtain more information 
about suicide victims with the goal of iden- 
tifying a set of conditions or warning signs 
which may predict other suicides. (See Lit- 
man, this volume.) Through interviews with 
family members, friends, teachers, and other 
contacts, the researchers attempt to 
reconstruct the lifestyle, symptoms and be- 
haviors, personal and occupational histories, 
and medical records of deceased persons. 

Psychological autopsies of adults show that 
depression and alcoholism account for most 
suicides. Analyses of younger victims, 
however, show that while adolescent suicides 
are preceded by psychological maladjust- 
ment, fewer young suicide victims suffered 
from depression; most had a combination of 
affective and antisocial, aggressive be- 
haviors. The largest group of young suicides 
(mostly males) are those with conduct or per- 
.sonality disorders, often mixed with drug use. 
These include impulsive or antisocial young 
people, many of whom had gotten into some 
kind of trouble. Another group (usually 
females) suffer from depression. A third 
group of suicides consist of youngsters who 
are compulsive, hard striving perfectionists, 
socially inhibited and prone to extreme 
anxiety in the face of any social or academic 
challenge. A proportion of youngsters do 
not appear to have diagnosable psychologi- 
cal disorders and their emotional or 
psychological problems are sometimes un- 
recognized and untreated. 

The researchers further found that adoles- 
cents who were presuicidal differed from one 
another in behaviors, psychological diag- 
noses, and responses to environmental stres- 
ses. School problems and conduct disorders 
were common as were social withdrawal and 
friendlessness. Some were high achievers, 
some were low achievers. The breakup of a 
relationship was a traumatic factor strongly 
contributing to suicide. Many suicide victims 
had been exposed to suicide previously

14

through suicidal siblings, friends, parents, or 
other relatives. Many had thought about, 
threatened, or made a previous suicide at- 
tempt. 

What all had in common were periods of 
hopelessness \nd thoughts of death as a solu- 
tion to theii problems. Most of the 
youngsters gavt i^lues to their suicidal inten- 
tions, to a peer, a family member, or a profes- 
sional person, either verbally or by their 
behavior. These clues might be construed as 
"reaching out for help." Clues, however, 
were often recognizable only in hindsight be- 
cause adolescents tended to camouflage 
them well. About half of the young suicides 
had recent, but brief contact with the mental 
health system. lu fact, a major problem with 
young people at risk for suicide is getting 
them into a therapeutic contact and keeping 
them there. Families and therapists tend to 
ignore or deny clues to suicide, thus making 
it even more difficult for a child in trouble to 
enter treatment 

Role of alcohol and substance use 

Few clinicians doubt the close association of 
alcohol and heavy drug use with suicide. An 
estimated one-half of all suicides are as- 
sociated with alcohol use. The effects of 
chronic drug use increase the likelihood of 
depression, despair, and feelings of hopeless- 
ness. Dr. Meeks points out that a great deal 
of depression found in chemically dependent 
individual is a result of addiction rather than 
its cause (see Meeks, this volume). Chronic 
use of cocaine, for example, produces 
depression and dysphoria. These drug ef- 
fects are enhanced in adolescents who are 
developing emotionally and physically. 
Adolescents heavily involved in drugs are 
particularly susceptible to increasing feelings 
of guilt resulting from the loss of judgment 
and self control, alienation from families, z > 
cumulating failures, and personally unaccep- 
table behaviors which the adolescent had to 
perform in order to get drugs. Although 
these feelings may be denied at first, con- 
tinued drug use coupled with the feelings of 
uselessness, failure, and confusion, eventual- 



ly may overwhelm the young person and lead 
to suicidal behavior as a way out of 
psychological pain. 

In addition to depression, other frequently 
observed factors make chemically dependent 
3K)ungsters more vulnerable to suicide: a 
strong family history of alcoholism or other 
drug abuse, and a recent loss or separation 
(most commonly parental separation or 
divorce). 

In treating suicidal adolescent drug users, the 
crucial aspects in preventing suicide are 
recognizing when the adolescent is in crisis 
(e.g., stating a desire to die) and providing 
care and protection at the time. These 
patients are difficult to treat partly because 
adolescents and their parents resist treat- 
ment and try to make the process as difficult 
as possible. In addition, the underlying 
problems that led the youngster to use drugs 
in the first place are difficult to change on a 
permanent basis. They require long-term 
treatment and continued alertness to the 
recurrence of suicidal risk. A team approach 
treatment-involving family, friends, and 
peers-seems to work well for chemically de- 
pendent adolescents. 

MINORITY AND GAY YOUTH 

Some young people may respond to external 
pressures with which they cannot cope by ex- 
hibiting self-destructive behaviors, the most 
extreme of which is taking one's own life. 
Suicide victims who are homosexual, belong 
to minority groups, and children who are un- 
duly influenced by violence in the media may 
fit this model. 

Many significant life events ultimately deter- 
mine one's behavior, personality, and coping 
styles. Adolescence is a turbulent period 
filled with many complex physical and 
psychosocial developmental problems which 
make the transition from childhood to adul- 
thood difficult. A major developmental task 
for adolescents is to establish a stable iden- 
tity. Adolescents are beginning to develop 
sexually and trying to understand their sexual 
identity. Those who have homosexual ten- 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



dencies are confused about their feelings and 
face a tremendous internal struggle to under- 
stand and accept themselves. 

Stresses related to being a member of a 
minority group in the UnitedStates may com- 
plicate the adolescent maturing process. En- 
vironmental factors and conflicts a young 
person encounters in reconciling minority 
cultures with the dominant American culture 
have been postulated as contributing factors 
to suicides among black, Native American, 
Hispanic, and Asian youth. 

Gay youth 

Gay and lesbian youth are two to three times 
more likely to attempt suicide than other 
young people (See Gibson, this volume). 
Gay youth ( ice a hostile and condemning en- 
vironment, verbal and physical abuse, and 
rejection and isolation from families and 
peers (an estimated 25% of young gay males 
are forced to leave home because of conflicts 
over their sexual identity). The traumatic 
consequences of these external pressures 
make gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transsexual 
youth more vulnerable than other youth to a 
variety of psychosocial problems and self- 
destructive behavior, including substance 
abuse, chronic depression, relationship con- 
flicts, and school failure, each of which are 
risk factors for suicidal feelings and behavior. 

Help for these adolescents needs to derive 
from all levels of a society that stigmatizes 
and discriminates against gays and lesbians. 
For example, mental health and youth ser- 
vice agencies can provide acceptance and 
support for young homosexuals, train their 
personnel on gay issues, and provide ap- 
propriate gay adult role models; schools can 
protect gay youth from abuse from their 
peers and provide accurate information 
about homosexuality in health curricula; 
families should accept their child and work 
toward educating themselves about the 
development and nature of homosexuality. 

Minority youth 

Data show that the highest suicide rates 



among minorities (Native Americans, blacks 
and Hispanics) occur in the younger age 
groups, a pattern that differs from whites 
among whom sviicide rates increase with age. 
Strong cultural traditions and social support 
systems among minority groups arc believed 
to play a role in protecting older age groups 
from suicide. 

Because minority groups are made up of 
many different cultural entities, one must be 
cautious about using aggregate data to 
generalize about a segment of a larger group. 
For example, Hispanics include people with 
Mexican, Cuban, Puerto Rican, and other 
Latin American heritages; Native Americans 
include members of more than 500 federally 
recognized tribes, many of whom have dif- 
ferent languages, customs, and cultural tradi- 
tions. 

Native Americans 

Dr. Thompson (see report, this volume) 
points out that a true picture of suicide 
among Native American youth may not be 
accurate from the aggregated data furnished 
by the Indian Health Service (IHS). Suicide 
rates vary considerably among individual 
American Indian tribes and data from a few 
tribes cannot be generalized to all Indians. 
Several other reasons contribute to the un- 
reliability of American Indian suicide data; 
few data are available on American Indians 
who live outside IHS service areas and off 
reservations. American Indians living in 
urban areas may not be correctly identifled as 
Indians on death certificates; deaths may not 
be reported as suicides partly because of 
reluctance to bring adverse publicity to an 
American Indian community; and small 
changes in raw numbers of suicide may look 
very large in terms of changes in rates. 

The IHS, nevertheless, report« an average 
rate of 27.9 suicides per 100,000 Native 
Americans of ages 15 to 24 during 1981 to 
1983; the suicide rate for all Americans 15 to 
24 was 12.2 during the same time period. The 
base population, however, used by the IHS 
to calculate these rates has changed over 
time, thereby prssenting problems in observ- 



3-10 



16 



National Conference on Prevention and Interventions 



ing suicide trends. Suicide patterns among 
Native Americans differ from those of their 
white peers in that the peak rate of suicide 
occurs between ages 15 through 24; white 
suicide rates are higher after age 35. 

Preventive interventions for Native 
Americans should focus on those com- 
munities which can be demonstrated by 
epidemiologically sound research to have a 
problem needing a specialized response. A 
better approach is needed for suicide data 
collection and data comparisons. Addressing 
the enormous cultural conflicts between the 
white and Indian cultures is a necessary 
preventive strategy. Other efforts, such as 
primary prevention and early recognition 
and treatment of the social and psychiatric 
conditions which lead to self-destructive be- 
haviors, must be p'anned in conjunction with 
the individual tribes themselves with un- 
obtrusive measures and with cultural sen- 
sitivity. 

Blacks 

Dr. Baker (see report, this volume) reviewed 
black suicide rates and characteristics of 
black suicide attempters in an effort to dis- 
cern reasons for the large increase in black 
suicide rates for 15 to 24 year olds-from 
4.9/100,000 in 1950 to 11.1 in 1981. Except 
in specific instances, the suicide rate for 
blacks is roughly half as great as among 
whites for both males and females. Black 
male suicides outnumber black females by 
about 4 to 1. 

Many scientists have suggested that the 
lower suicide rates reflected a strong support 
system in traditional black culture, rein- 
forced by the black church and social and 
fraternal organizations, but that marked 
sociocultural changes in black families and 
black communities have caused those institu- 
tions to lose their appeal to many black 
people. 

Dr. Baker discusses several theories that 
have been advanced to explain the rise of 
suicide among blacks, but only the theories 
which emphasize interpersonal conflicts. 



familial discord, financial concerns, and the 
impact of poverty and racism on the in- 
dividual and his family seem to hold up as 
speciflc etiologies of suicide attempts and 
completions among blacks. 

Primary \ eventive strategies, Dr. Baker sug- 
gests, should focus on helping black youth 
understand the sources of their stress and 
identify effective action. For example, im- 
proving families' knowledge of symptoms of 
mental illness and alcohol and drug abuse will 
allow a family to seek help before a destruc- 
tive episode occurs. Secondary prevention 
should focus on evaluation and crisis inter- 
vention for suicide attempters and their 
families, and, to prevent further suicide at- 
tempts, provide a family with alternatives for 
help in the event of a future crisis. 

HIspanlcs 

Suicide data on Hispanic youth were ob- 
tained from five southwestern States where 
more than 60 percent of all Hispanics in the 
United States reside (see Smith, this 
volume). The suicide rate for Hispanics 
(mostly Mexican-American in this 
geographic area), is lower than the rate for 
non-Hispanic whites but higher than rates for 
blacks. Young Hispanic males, however, in 
the 15 to 19 year age group, have a slightly 
higher suicide rate than non-Hispanic white 
males in the same age group. Contrary to the 
patterns observed among non-Hispanic 
whites for whom the suicide rate increases 
with age, the highest suicide rates for 
Hispanics occur in the 20 to 24 year age 
group. The ratio of male to female suicides 
is 4.3 to 1 for Hispanics. 

The lower overall suicide rate among 
Hispanics likely reflects the strength of 
Hispanic cultural traditions in which close 
family ties along with the desire not to 
dishonor one's family through suicide 
decrease the risk of social isolation. The ex- 
tent to which these cultural traditions con- 
tinue to be held within Hispanic communities 
may influence the future incidence of suicide. 
As younger Hispanics become assimilated 



17 



■3-11 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



into American culture, Hispanic traditions 
may lose their power to influence behavior. 
HispaDJc youths, caught between traditional 
values and their expenences in the larger so- 
cial order, coupled with the marginal 
socioeconomic status of this group, may ex- 
perience stresses that explain the younger 
age distribution pattern of Hispanic suicide 
victims. 

Asian-Americans 

Very few studies have examined suicide 
among Asian American youth. Available in- 
formation indicates that Chinese, Japanese, 
and Filipino male suicide rates are generally 
lower than those of American males except 
in the oldest age groups. Dr. Yu analyzed the 
sparse suicide data for Asian American (see 
this volume). By calculating proportional 
mortality rates. Dr. Yu showed that, within 
Chinese and Japanese-American popula- 
tions, suicides have risen dramatically be- 
tween 1970 and 1980. Possible explanations 
may be rooted in the social problems faced 
by young Asian Americans in their struggle 
to excel and establish themselves in 
American society. 

Influence of the media on suicide 

Asocial factor often cited as having an effect 
on suicide is the popular media. Several re- 
search projects have suggested that violence 
on television leads to imitative aggressive be- 
havior by children and teenagers. 

Other studies suggest that televised news 
stories or Actional portrayals of suicide con- 
tribute to suicidal behaviors among young 
people with imitative behavior of suicides. 
One study reported an increase in teenage 
suicides during the week following news or 
feature stories about suicide. Another group 
analyzed the effect of four fictional television 
programs about suicide that were broadcast 
in the New York City area. Much advance 
publicity generated public awareness of 
youth suicide and some areas provided 
telephone hotline numbers and information 
about local crisis services. The rates of both 



completed and attempted suicides rose in the 
two weeks following the telecasts. 

In his review. Dr. Berman (see this volume) 
believes that television's influence on 
suicides is equivocal. Broadcasts portraying 
violence or suicide (including news reports of 
celebrity suicides) might influence the 
method of suicide in peksons already 
predisposed to killing themselves, but are un- 
likely to entice nonsuicidal youngsters. 

As a significant part of the sociocultural 
milieu in which children are raised, television 
and other mass media have the potential to 
profoundly alter the message environment to 
which children react The best use of the 
media for prevention may be in prosocial 
education in early childhood. Cooperation 
between media representatives and 
suicidologists might be useful in establishing 
guidelines for news reports and Actional 
presentations of suicides. Public informa- 
tion campaigns for suicide prevention should 
be guided by principles, learned from other 
health promotion campaigns, regarding dis- 
semination, targeting, timing, frequen(7, and 
duration of messages. A media campaign 
should be reinforced by supplementary ef- 
forts in the home, school, or other settings 
where interpersonal communication is 
promoted. Careful evaluations must be in- 
corporated into a public information cam- 
paign to establish rational bases for future 
campaigns. 

Religious beliefs and family 
structure 

Religion and the family are social contexts in 
which people are physically, emotionally, and 
psychologically bonded. Religious committ- 
ment and strong family ties, in general, 
provide protection from suicide by promot- 
ing shared values, strong social interaction 
and supportive connections with other 
people. The greater the intensity of people's 
ties and connections with each other, the less 
chance there will be of suicide.

National Conference on Prevention and Interventions 



Criminal and Juvenile Justice 

Eacli year about a half million juveniles are 
put in adult jails. The risk of suicide for these 
young persons is particularly high. Jails are 
frightening, intimidating environments, 
especially for youngsters detained for the 
first time. Although many facilities have in- 
corporated special precautions to minimize 
the opportunity for suicide and prevent 
detainees from taking their lives, the suicide 
rate for juveniles in jails is Hve times higher 
than the national rate. 

Most of the juveniles arrested are coming out 
of drug or alcohol intoxication, runaways, 
children fleeing from abuse or neglect, or are 
retarded, disturbed, mentally ill, or hand- 
icapped individuals. Approximately 10 to 15 
percent of young people are jailed for 
violence offenses. For all of them, the first 
few hours of confinement are the most 
dangerous. 

Young people who have been arrested 
should be evaluated by a mental health 
professional to determine whether incar- 
ceration or hospitalization is appropriate. If 
placed in jail, careful observation, separation 
of juveniles from adults, and removal of per- 
sonal items that can be used as a means for 
hanging might reduce the chance of suicide. 

COMMUNHY EFFORTS IN 
SUICIDE PREVENTION AND 
INTERVENTION 

Various suicide prevention programs 
emerged during the 1960s and expanded 
rapidly during the 1970s, but little attention 
was paid, until relatively recently, to the 
specific needs of young people. Very few 
reports appeared in the health or social 
scientific literature addressing detection and 
treatment of suicidal behavior in the young. 

Among the earliest prevention concepts 
were the suicide prevention centers, which 
were consortia of psychologists, social 
workers, psychiatrists, and trained volunteers 
combining suicide research with treatment of 
troubled individuals. Although supported 



initially with Federal funds, many suicide 
prevention centers evolved into locally 
funded, community-based services. About 
1,000 suicide prevention programs or crisis 
programs, exclusive of community mental 
health programs, are in operation in the 
United States today; about 200 are specifical- 
ly called suicide prevention centers. Most of 
the program names, however, e.g., crisis cen- 
ter, telephone hotline, reflect a broader, 
crisis intervention purpose th.;n suicide 
prevention. They offer counseling, caring 
voices and listeners (by telephone or in per- 
son), and other crisis services such as short- 
term therapy delivered by trained 
para-professionals. These programs 
generally focus their efforts on adults, but 
with the increasing importance of youth 
suicide, some, but not the majority, of these 
programs have established components 
specifically directed at adolescents (see 
Comstock, Simmons, Franklin, this volume). 

Centers usually have referral networks-a 
consulting staff of health professionals, ac- 
cess to other community services such as law 
enforcement, social service or mental health 
agencies, and emergency medical personnel, 
to serve as back-up resources. 

After a teen's suicide, the surviving parents 
and siblings experience significant stress and 
dysfunction. Many centers, as well as private 
therapists, offer grief counseling to help 
family members, friends, and peers to deal 
with the pain, guilt, anger, and other emo- 
tions following a suicide. Counseling sur- 
vivors often includes examining the 
emotional and mental problems experienced 
by the young suicide victim for the purpose 
of making it more difficult for survivors to 
identify with the dead person. Such therapy 
helps to lessen the chances of suicide by 
bereaved persons. (See Mitchell, this 
volume.) 

Role of volunteers 

Eighty percent of the suicide prevention 
centers in the United States operate with 
nonprofessional volunteers as their primary 



3-13 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force or) Youth Suicide 



staff. In fact, the centers are one of the few 
instances in which trained, lay volunteers 
provide clinical services that had traditional- 
ly been provided by professionals. The crisis 
worker's role is to establish a rapport with a 
caller, listen to a person's description of his 
problems, and work with him in setting a 
course of action. (Some researchers have 
reported that people with professional train- 
ing are not demonstrably more effective than 
lay volunteers as crisis intervention workers.) 
Since the early 1980s, operating standards for 
suicide prevention centers and training and 
performance evaluation criteria for volun- 
teer crisis workers promulgated by the 
American Association of Suicidology have 
made progress in alleviating public mistrust 
and professional skepticism about crisis in- 
tervention techniques and volunteer crisis 
workers. (See Wyatt, this volume.) Whether 
health professionals or lay volunteers serve 
as crisis workers, special training as well as in- 
service training is necessary to maintain the 
unique and special skills required for crisis in- 
tervention and suicide prevention. 

Caring and intelligent young people can also 
be involved in suicide prevention strategies 
(see Bolton, this volume). Young people ex- 
perience many losses and stresses (including 
body changes, moving away from friends and 
support groups, and living up to parental and 
social expectations) and need help in ac- 
knowledging and understanding their feel- 
ings and coping with sorrow and anger. With 
proper help and guidance, young people can 
take charge of their own lives, handle crisis 
and solve problems and feel valued and 
worthwhile. 

An independent suicide prevention or- 
ganization is The Samaritans, founded in 
England in 1953. (See Katzoff, this volume.) 
Samaritans have 275 branches worldwide and 
14 branches in the United States. The 
branches provide walk-in and 24-hour 
telephone crisis services for lonely, suicidal 
individuals. Volunteers offer "befriending" 
by listening without judging, offering un- 
wanted advice, or intervening without being 



asked. With the caller's permission, volun- 
teers can call in professional cocsultants. 
Several branches provide outreach programs 
such as developing school curricula on 
suicide awareness, distributing literature, 
and providing speakers for schools and 
universities. 

Despite the variety of programs and com- 
munity agenries available to assist young 
people in dealing with stressful situations, to 
obtain help, young people must be able to 
identify the appropriate community agencies 
(e.g., emergency medical centers, community 
mental health agencies, child abuse services, 
crisis hotlines or help centers). A high level 
of community awareness must be ac'iieved 
and sustained over time in order to fricilitate 
knowledge about resources available within 
the community which can provide services to 
people under various forms of stre&.s. 

Effectiveness 

Of the wide range of interventions that ad- 
minister to young people at risk for suicide or 
who have attempted suicide, little is known 
about their effectiveness-whether the inter- 
vention can prevent suicide or suicidal risk. 
The conference presenters emphasized that 
no evaluati 'n studies of preventive activities 
targeted exclusively to young people ap- 
peared in the scientific literature. For ex- 
ample, no data demonstrate that the 
numerous community-based suicide preven- 
tion programs for young people (telephone 
hotlines, school-based suicide education 
programs, peer support groups, counseling 
of runaways, and similar attempts) are effec- 
tive in preventing suicides. The same applies 
to psychiatric or psychological therapy and to 
other services that include suicide preven- 
tion as part of their mission, such as mental 
health centers, clinics, or counseling agen- 
cies. 

EARLY DETECTION AND 
TREATMENT 

A wide range of psychological, sociological or 



20 

o ?,-14 
ERIC 



National Conference on Prevention and Interventions 



psychiatric theories attempt to explain 
suicide among the young. Adolescence is a 
time when youngsters experience important 
physical and emotional changes, feel new 
desires, develop a sense of identity, and break 
the dependent bonds formed in childhood 
with parents. For some youngsters, this is a 
time of profound sadness, stress, and loss, 
causing serious mental and emotional adjust* 
ment problems. Understanding the be- 
haviors and life events that precede suicide 
are essential to designing models for detect- 
ing a potential suicide, preventing the act, 
and treating the individual. 

Detection 

Prevention would be most efficient if wf; 
could identify some common characteristic! 
which allow individuals who have a high 
probability of later suicide to be identified 
and brought into a prevention program. Drs. 
Blumenthal and Kupfer (see paper, this 
volume) have proposed a three-level mod^' 
for detecting potentially suicidal beha\ 
The first level represents a detection strategy 
in which high risk groups are identified and 
**red-flagged** for tracking and educational 
purposes. While level I includes individuals 
who are not in immediate danger of suicide, 
they have certain risk factors such as being 
children of substance abusing parents, or 
children who have experience id extreme 
stress 3uch as divorce or the recent death of 
a parent> Level II deals with young persons 
with major behavioral symptoms who do not 
meet criteria for a psychiatric disorder, but in 
whom assessment and intervention may be 
required. Children with emotional difficul- 
ties, learning disabilities, extreme aggressive- 
ness, runaways, and those with severe 
self-esteem problems fall into this group. 
Level III represents the detection of a 
psychiatric disorder of sufficient severity to 
require assessment and inte rvention by men- 
tal health professionals. 

The authors also propose a theoretical model 
of suicidal behavior consisting of five over* 
lapping "risk domains** or groups of risk fac- 
tors for suicide* Used together with the three 



detection awareness levels, the overlap 
model of suicide risk may be usefully applied 
to treatment, clinical investigation, educa- 
tion, and clinical intervention. The five risk 
domains are: 

1. Psychiiitric diagnosis of a patient. 

2. Personality traits that relate to suicide 
such is aggression, impulsiveness, hope- 
lessness, and borderline personality disor- 
der. 

3. Psychosocial factors, such as the strength 
of a person's social supports, number of 
negative life events, and presence of 
clironic medical illness. 

4. Genetic and family factors that predispose 
an individual to suicide. 

5 Neurochemical and biochemical variables 
which may indicate a biological vul- 
nerability to suicide. 

The authors stress that physicians-- 
pediatricians, internists, obstetricians, and 
others outside the mental health field-need 
to be aware of, recognize, and document 
suicidal risk behavior and psychosocial stres- 
ses. While health care professionals deal 
with stressful health issues such as chronic 
diseases or unwanted pregnancies, they often 
are unaware of the additional risk imposed by 
other factors in the model. Clinicians, there- 
fore, should be educated to diagnose 
psychiatric syndromes and suicidal behavior, 
and to intervene and reier when appropriate. 

Treatment of adolescent suicide 
attempters 

Suicide attempters often have a number of 
coexisting problems-mood and conduct dis- 
turbances, drug and alcohol abuse, aggres- 
sion-which are similar to those of other 
psychiatric patients. Suicide attempters are 
a very diverse group and it is difficult to know 
which problems will improve in therapy, but 
in general, suicidal behavior may not change 
in the long run. 

In his review of treatment strategies for 
suicide attempters. Dr. Trautman (see paoer , 



3-15 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



this volume) found that no specific treatment 
approaches-behavioral, psychotherapeutic, 
or psychopharamocologic-are superior to 
some other treatment or to no treatment at 
all. Or, are there specific treatments that are 
applicable only to suicide attempters? 

Once in the mental health service system 
after a suicide attempt, adolescents are dif- 
ficult to manage and retain in treatment. 
Most drop out early in the course of therapy. 
Dr. Trautman estimates that 40. percent of 
adolescent suicide attempters do not have a 
psychological evaluation and only 20 percent 
complete a brief therapy program of three 
months. In addition, parents are often resis- 
tant to their child's therapy, may deny the 
need for continuing treatment, and refuse to 
participate in the child's treatment them- 
selves. 

Many suicide attempters have immediate 
problems of a brief nature which are oftf.n 
quickly resolved. Therefore, brief, crisis- 
oriented treatment and followup, on an out- 
patient basis, makes sense for many patients. 
Longer treatment is necessary for more 
severely disturbed patients. Good therapy 
for adolescents is active, explanatory, teaches 
problem solving and other social and be- 
havioral skills, and uses outside resources 
(cognitive-behavioral therapy meets these 
needs). Because parent-child conflict is the 
most common immediate precipitating factor 
of suicidal behavior, family involvement, with 
the goals of decreasing destructive family in- 
teractions and increasing communication 
among family members, is an essential com- 
ponent of successful management of suicidal 
adolescents. New approaches, however, 
need to be developed to educate families 
about the therapy process, reach out to those 
who will not or cannot come to a treatment 
setting, and attract minority and low-income 
families to come for needed therapy. 

SCHOOl DASED PROGRAMS 
FOR SUICIDE PREVENTION 

School-based intervention programs are be- 
coming increasingly common, primarily bc- 




3-16 



cause schools offer a good opportunity for 
reaching the largest number of young people. 
Schools are the most accessible place to 
make an early identification of troubled, or 
potentially suicidal youth. Many school in- 
itiatives in suicide were instituted in response 
to local legislation or community pressure 
following a wave of suicides within a par- 
ticular school or school district. 

The types of programs offered in schools and 
the populations they serve vary greatly. Dr. 
Garfinkel's review of school programs (see 
paper, this volume) emphasizes that success- 
ful school programs should integrate an un- 
derstanding of risk factors for youth suicide, 
behavioral characteristics and clinical 
symptoms of suicidal individuals, and various 
psychosocial stressors experienced by 
suicidal adolescents. He proposes several 
components that he believes are critical in 
developing elective school-based preven- 
tion programs: 

• Early identification and screening by 
teachers and other school personnel, 
which includes recognizing certain be- 
havior patterns and stressful life events 
that suicidal adolescents experience. 

• Comprehensive psychological testing 
and psychiatric assessment of students 
identified as needing further evaluation. 

• Crisis intervention and management. 
Other individuais-for example, coaches, 
clergy, social workers-who may be able 
to provide help, should collaborate in 
therapy as part of a suicide prevention 
team, which should be present in every 
school. The team should act as an advo- 
cate for any youngster suspected of being 
at risk for suicide. 

• Programs immediately following a 
suicide of a young person in the com- 
munity. These efforts aim at preventing 
imitation and deemphasizing feelings of 
guilt, responsibility and anger from over< 
whelming the survivors. 

• Educational programs for students, 
teachers, and administrative school per- 

22 



National Conference on Prevention and Interventions 



sonnel to develop sensitivity and aware- 
ness of youth suicide. School programs 
that deal v^th raising awareness of the 
student body to suicide and its preven- 
tion include discussions led by trained 
professionals that encourage students to 
discuss suicidal thoughts, talk about feel- 
ings for friends lost to suicide, and discuss 
how friends can help when a troubled 
youngster is identified. 

Many school programs do not deal 
directly with suicide, but are designed to 
help youth function better in their en- 
vironment by developing skills to cope 
with stressful life events, communicate 
more clearly, recognize depression in 
themselves and their peers, and feel bet- 
ter about themselves. 

• Community linkage and networking. 
Any given school's suicide prevention 
team should link with other school dis- 
tricts and community social service and 
mental health resources in order to 
provide information or special resources 
in facilitating referrals for treatment and 
foUowup for young people at risk, or 
after a crisis or suicide attempt. Net- 
working further includes coordinating 
community needs for education 
programs, and resolving media issues 
dealing with public coverage of suicides. 

No one has been able to demonstrate that 
school programs directed to students or 
school personnel are effective in reducing 
suicide. In fact, school suicide prevention 
programs have generated controversy in 
some communities. Some parents fear that 
open discussion will introduce the idea of 
suicide to teenagers who were not suicidal, 
and some school officials believe that the 
many demands on the school system and 
limited funding for special initiatives 
preclude suicide prevention programs. 

Others, however, believe that numerous 
beneficial effects are possible. For example, 
open discussion of suicide might facilitate 
disclosure of some student's preoccupations 
with suicide, which in turn will lead to inter- 



ventions to reduce the risk of suicide. Im- 
proving coping skills might aid in raising self- 
esteem, reducing school failure, and reducing 
depression and self-destructive behaviors, 
thereby generating better mental health 
even among persons at low risk for suicide. 

In the long run, we must work toward the 
rigorous evaluation of in-school suicide 
prevention programs on a large enough scale 
to provide statistically significant results of 
their effectiveness. 

RISK REDUCTION 

The cost of suicide in terms of mortality, the 
effects on lives saved, and the costs of health 
care are great. The numerous factors as- 
sociated with suicide are far reaching and 
deeply rooted in the problems of society, 
family, and the biological makeup of the in- 
dividual. Each of these issues suggests a 
specific set of interventions. Dr. Cantor (see 
paper, this volume) discusses a variety of in- 
terventions aimed at reducing risk of suicide 
through changing the environment in which 
young people function. She concludes that 
the interventions most likely to have the 
greatest impact on youth suicide are: 
decreasing the cultural pervasiveness of 
violence; limiting the availability of lethal 
agents such as firearms, medications, and 
drugs and alcohol; and instituting education- 
al programs for youth, parents, and the 
public. Training others who come into con* 
tact with young people-school personnel, 
primary care health professionals, youth 
group leaders-to be aware of the warning 
signs of a disturbed youngster offers a way to 
bring young people into the helping system 
early enough to avoid feelings of hopeless- 
ness which can precede suicidal behavior. 

Suicides are rare events that are difficult to 
predict, and effective interventions have not 
been identified even for the groups at highest 
risk— suicide attempters and psychi'^tric 
patients. Screening large high-risk popula- 
tions is very expensive and catches relatively 
few suicides. Limiting screening to smaller 
high-risk groups yields even fewer suicides

risk to be identified so that intensive and 
specific therapeutic interventions may be

CONCLUDING NOTE 

A considerable amount of energy and good- 
will, human sensitivity and kindness has gone 
into suicide prevention activities. The costs 
are, for the most part, very high and little 
evidence demonstrates their effectiveness. 
Even though full knowledge of the etiology 
of suicide is not in our grasp and research on 
preventive strategies is not yet complete, the 
time for action is now. To postpone attempts 
at preventive interventions until answers are 
provided by experimental programs would be 
to ignore common sense and clinical ex- 
perience. We must continue with new ideas 
and fresh strategies, trying new approaches 
until evaluative studies point the way. Fur- 
ther, interventions must integrate the diverse 
interests in the field, public and private, and 
involve a wide variety of support systems 
within the youngster's environment-family, 
school, business and industry, health care 
professionals, and social and religious institu- 
tions. As new data emerge, the strength of 
the scientiHc base of suicide prevention will 
expand. 

The following major topics were convened in 
the papers presented at the conference on 
prevention and interventions: 

1. Better statistical data on suicide and 
suicide attempts by persons between ages 
IS and 24. Suicide, to an unknown extent, 
is universally understated as a cause of 
death in vital statistics. This underreport- 
ing results from difficulties in establishing 
suicidal intent, practical considerations 
(such as the loss of insurance benefits), 
and the social stigma associated with 
suicide. Problems with determining eth- 
nicity of a decedent may cause under- 
reporting of deaths in minority groups. 

2. Epidemiologic analysis of suicide patterns 



to facilitate identification of risk factors, 
high risk groups, and trends in suicide. 
Epidemiologic and empirical evidence is 
needed to lay the groundwork for a scien- 
tific understanding of youth suicidi^. 
Research should focus on the nature, cc- 
tent, and consequences of drug and al- 
cohol abuse among youths as well as the 
influence of mental illnesses such as 
depression, on risk and as precursors of 
suicide. 

3. New strategies for pi imary prevention and 
treatment. There ave few sp)ecific models 
of primary prevrmf.ion programs and little 
or no information on the effectiveness of 
such programs on suicide. Development 
of new techniques in primary prevention 
should be encouraged and tested ap- 
propriately. Treatment techniques similPi 
to those used to treat depression in adults 
are not, in general, applicable to young 
people. The mental health community 
must develop ways of identifying the early 
signs and behaviors related to suicidal in- 
tent and design specific interventions for 
those at varying degrees of risk. The ap- 
propriateness and effectiveness of in- 
dividual and group therapy must be better 
understood. 

4. Research into community level interven- 
tion efforts. While the nonmedical com- 
munity has responded to suicides by 
establishing crisis services, such as 
telephone hotlines or drop-in clinics, more 
research is needed to investigate whether 
these approaches are effective and how 
they may be made more effective. These 
services need to be publicized in such a 
way that teenagers can identify an ap- 
propriate community agency (or suicide 
prevention hotline) to assist in coping with 
a stressful situation. Specialized training 
in suicide prevention should be provided 
to persons who give help to young people 
at risk for suicide. 

5. Understanding the special conditions cf 
minorities. Attention needs to be given to 
the unique needs of gay, lesbian, black, 
Hispanic, Native American, and Asian 



3-18

youth, who may perceive a difTerent and 
sometimes hostile world. 

6. Education of the public. The general 
public and especially those who are in con- 
tact with youngsters, such as parents, 
teachers, and other gatekeepers (includ- 
ing the broadcast and print media) should 
become aware of the warning signs and cir- 
cumstances that may lead to suicide. 
Young people should become aware that 
they can receive help in dealing with their 
problems. Special care must be taken to 
ensure that discussion of suicide does not 
become a stimulus rather than a deterrent. 

7. School-based programs for prevention. 
Schools are one place for identifying youth 
at risk. School personnel, working with, or 
being trained by professionals, should 
develop screening methods for identifying 
children who may be experiencing stresses 
and personal problems. Prevention and 
intervention techniques and curricula for 
educating and counseling young people at 
risk and their peers are also needed. Al- 
though effectiveness has not been proved, 
teaching youngsters psychological 
strategies such as skills for coping with 
stressful life events, problemsolving, 
decisionmaking, confrontational skills, 
communication skills, and building self-es- 
teem can be helpful for all young people. 
Schools should develop networks with 
community and professional groups such 
that teenagers with problems can be 
referred appropriately for treatment. 



8. Developing services to detect and treat 
potentially suicidal young persons. Better 
methods of detection (triage techniques) 
in hospital emergen^ rooms should be 
developed to detect whether self-inflicted 
injuries are indeed suicide attempts. 
Protocols should be developed that 
provide for consistent diagnosis and treat- 
ment of young people suspected of having 
D^ade a suicide attempt. In addition, 
methods should be developed to retain 
young people at high risk for suicide in a 
treatment regimen. Primary care 
physicians should take careful histories re- 
lated to personal stress, substance abuse 
and psychological coping skills.

PRIMARY PREVENTION: A CONSIDERATION OF 
GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND FINDINGS FOR THE 
PREVENTION OF YOUTH SUICIDE 

Robert D. Felner, Ph.D,, Professor of Psychology, University of Illinois at Champaign/Urbana, 
Champaign, Illinois 

Morton Silverman, M.D., Associate Administrator for Prevention, Alcohol, Dmg Abuse, and 
Mental Health Administration, Rockville, Maryland 



The task that we were asked to address is one 
that we found both daunting and important: 
to provide a brief overview of the current 
state of knowledge in the area of primary 
prevention, discuss what we know about cur- 
rent research strategies, and link it to what 
we know about adolescent suicide, with a 
particular emphasis on the implications for 
future interventions and research. To begin, 
we need a common definition of primary 
prevention and then, what we mean by 
primary prevention of suicide among 
children and adolescents. The essential com- 
ponents of the most widely agreed upon 
definition of primary prevention are: 

1. Primary prevention seeks to reduce he in- 
cidence of new cases of a disorder in a 
population, as well as the prevalence of 
that disorder; 

2. A key distinguishing feature of primary 
prevention, when contrasted to secondary 
or tertiary prevention, is the timing of the 
intervention. That is, primary prevention 
efforts are by definition T^efore the fact" 
in their application, i.e., before signs of the 
disorder are present; and 

3. Primary prevention activities are "inten- 
tioriaf and based in sound generative and 
executive knowledge bases (Cowen, 
1983). 



We have learned these principles from prior 
intervention efforts and well articulated con- 
ceptual frameworks or theoretical models. 
Now let us see what happens when we apply 
these issues to youth suicide. 

Being less certain of our expertise regarding 
suicide, per se, than we were about adoles- 
cence and prevention generally, we turned to 
the work of some colleagues, particularly 
thosewho^by their inclusion on this program, 
we could identify as experts in the area of 
suicide. Our first hope was that their work 
would tell us just when we could first identify/ 
categorize someone as suicidal (so we would 
know whom to target and if we prevented it). 
We also hoped the work of others would 
provide us with a thoughtful perspective on 
the current state of our knowledge concern- 
ing the causes of suicide so that we could then 
tie all this up in a neat set of suggestions for 
prevention. What we found was a field 
where the ''answers'*, to our questions were 
highly ambiguous and, indeed, the data and 
models available to support whatever tenta- 
tive answers at which we might arrive, was 
often in the formative stages of development. 
The state of the knowledge base specific to 
suicide is well articulated by Dr. Maris; he 
summarizes the literature thusly: ''the fact 
remains-and this may come as a surprise to

Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



most readen,--that few interdisciplinary sur- 
veys of suicidal behavior based on systematic 
samples have ever been done. ..thus one of 
the major problems in understanding self- 
destructive behaviors is that the data base for 
[generating] such potential explanations is 
conspicuously absent" (Maris, 1981, p. 6). 
He goes on to note the lack of sophistication 
in the designs employed even in those studies 
that have been carried out (e.g., lack of ade- 
quate comparison groups). Although this 
volume is dated 1981, our own reading of the 
research which has occurred in the interven- 
ing time seems to indicate that little has 
changed. While there have been several 
notable exceptions~for example, the data 
reported by Dr. Maris in his volume and else- 
where (Maris, 1985), and efforts by Drs. 
Motto and Garfmkel (Motto, 1985; Motto, 
Heilbron & Juster, 1985; Garfinkel, Froese 
& Hood, 1982) that focus more generally on 
"risk" factors—the cumulative weight of 
evidence necessary to address our concerns 
seemed lacking. Indeed, if one thing seems 
clear it is that whatever we knew about 
suicide in general, we knew somewhat less 
about youth suicide speciHcally. 

Confronted by this state of affairs, it did not 
seem that we could make specific recommen- 
dations about the primary prevention of 
youth suicide because two of the basic re- 
quirements, i.e., an adequate generative and 
executive knowledge base and the presence 
of sound conceptual models, did not seem to 
be met. 

We soon realized there were certain issues, 
such as the three identified earlier, that are 
basic to the mounting of all prevention 
.programs and might be extremely helpful in 
moving us toward developing adequate ways 
of thinking about the prevention of youth 
suicide from the perspective of a "preven- 
tionist." Given the current state of the litera- 
ture and debate about suicide, its causes, and 
its prevention, this literature does not allow 
us to answer several basic questions which 
need addressing if we are to mount effective 
prevention efforts. These include: 



1. When are efforts aimed at the prevention 
of youth suicide primary prevention rather 
than secondary or tertiary prevention? 

2. Who are the groups to whom interven- 
tions should be targeted? 

3. Where do we intervene, i.e., at the system 
or individual level? 

4. What are we trying to prevent? 

As shall become clear, all of these issues in- 
terlock. Thus, conceptual or empirical slip- 
page in one area may have snowball effect. 
Let us turn to these issues now in the context 
of the youth suicide literature. 

The question, "when is an effort termed 
primary prevention?" seems to be one which, 
by the focus of the suicide literature, if not at- 
tended to, could become a source of unin- 
tended conceptual confusion and dead-end 
efforts. A careful examination of the suicide 
literature reveals that an incredibiy broad 
array of factors are seen as placing youth and 
others "at risk" for self-destruction. Maris 
(1982, p. 5) tells us that "under the best of 
conditions life is short, periodically painful, 
fickle, often lonely and anxiety generating" 
.... "only if the human condition were 
dramatically changed would suicide change 
much" (ibid., p. 6) and, finally, "suicide 
derives from one's inability or refusal to ac- 
cept the terms of the human condition" (ibid., 
p. 8). The general point is that each of us may 
be more or less vulnerable to the stresses and 
strains of daily life and, under certain condi- 
tions of heightened vulnerability, may choose 
a suicidal alternative as the solution for 
adapting to these human conditions. By con- 
trast, a number of other authors, including 
Drs. Garfinkel and Motto, as well as Dr. 
Maris in some of his other work, point to 
more specific factors such as parental 
divorce, a family history of mental illness, in- 
creased stress and alienation among the 
young, being other than heterosexual in 
sexual orientation, the presence of depres- 
sive symptoms or substance abuse, prior 
psychiatric hospitalization, parental employ- 
ment history, the occurrence of non-lethal

attempts or a "suicidal career pattern", and 
the availability of lethal means, as all being 
risk or etiologic factors, most of these being 
empirically derived from epidemiological 
survey research (Garfinkel, Froese, & Hood, 
1982; Greuling & DeBlassie, 1980; Maris, 
1981; Maris, 1985; Motto, 1980; Motto, 
Heilbron, & Juster, 1985; Peck & Litman, 
1973). 

What becomes immediately apparent from 
this non-comprehensive set of risk factors is 
that, depending on which ones you elect to 
include on your list or to emphasize, the 
answers to: "To whom do we target our 
preventive efforts?" "What should be the 
focus of the intervention?" and "When 
should it occur?" are all quite different. The 
next step is to ask whether conceptual models 
or issues existed in the prevention literature 
which could help us think about these issues 
as they pertain to yc uth suicide. Having thus 
redefined the Questions for ourselves, we can 
now answer these questions a bit more clear- 

Assuming that primary prevention is targeted 
toward people who are not yet showing signs 
of disorder, the range of risk factors iden- 
tified by suicidologists coupled wiiA ques- 
tions yet to be resolved, such as whether 
unsuccessful attempts are at all comparable 
to lethal ones (Garfinkel, et aL 1982), present 
real problemis for the design of preventive in- 
terventions. 

Inherent in deciding the target of an inter- 
vention is that the timing of prevention is 
critical. Given the risk factors noted and a 
literal interpretation of the l^efore the fact" 
nature of primary prevention, it could be ar- 
gued that any intervention to reduce the pos- 
sibility of suicide by an adolescent who has 
not yet successfully taken his/her own life 
would qualify as primary prevention. Here, 
the reasoning goes, since one has not yet 
committed suicide one does not yet have the 
disorder. This position may seem a bit ex- 
treme and certainly a caricature of what a 
good prevention deHnition would bo but for 
the fact that it is a position reflected in much 
of the risk instrument development research 



(Maris, 1981; Motto, et aL 1985). In these 
Works, there is much talk of how a suicidal 
career, prior suicide attempts, or major 
symptoms of depression and psychiatric dis- 
order may be ''risk" factors. It is clear that 
what we are really talking about is Identify- 
ing predictors of a future lethal attempt, not 
precursors of suicide that are truly discon- 
tinuous with the disorder. The former is, of 
course, an important goal. However, iden- 
tifying too many risk factors may be more 
paralytic than enabling for prevention ef- 
forts-particularly for the development of 
conceptual clarity to guide us establishing 
a sound knowledge base for the prevention 
of youth suicide. 

At this point, a key debate in the prevention 
literature becomes salient if we are to decide 
how and when to move from "risk factors" to 
progranis. We need to be clear on how we 
answer the questions: a) Do we attempt to 
tailor primary prevention programs to the 
prevention of a specific disorder, or b) do we 
develop programs which are effective in al- 
leviating a number of conditions that are an- 
tecedent to a range of emotional and physical 
problems, including, but not limited to the 
target problem? 

The "specific disorder prevention" model 
rests heavily in a classic medical-public health 
paradigm which views diseases as caused by 
specific conditions that interact with in- 
dividual vulnerabilities, again, specifiable. In 
contrast, the antecedent condition model ar- 
gues that at least for a wide range of emotion- 
al and behavioral disorders, particularly 
those related to stress and other elements of 
the normal life-course, the specific etiology 
model is not appropriate (Goldstein, 1985). 

Since many of the conditions that seem to 
predict youth suicide (for example, early 
trauma, sexual deviance, drug and alcohol 
problems, and negative social interactions 
(Maris, 1985), predict other ^ jdictors of 
lethal attempts (such as depression and non- 
lethal "gestures"), and are themselves 
predicted by these latter predictors, we see 
that a "specific etiology" strategy for preven- 
tion may not fit the problem. On the other 



2ii

Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



hand, as Maris (1985) has pointed out, the 
overwhelming majority of adolescents do not 
kill themselves. Further, we note that the 
overwhehning majority of those adolescents 
and youth who display the previously iden- 
tified predictors and others like them, do not 
kill themselves. When viewed this way, it ap- 
pears that a specific etiology strategy may be 
more relevant. To be sure, a research 
strategy that focuses on factors relating to 
differential vulnerabilities appears ap- 
propriate to both strategies. Resolving this 
dilemma at the program implementation 
level is more difGcult. To some extent "they 
are both right-and also wrong." This is an 
issue that the working groups and the con- 
ference must resolve if we are to progress. 
We do have ^me suggestions, however, as to 
directions that may be helpful in structuring 
the discussion. 

We need to distinguish between predispos- 
ing conditions, precipitating conditions, 
necessary circumstances, and causal factors. 
Let us work backwards from the simplest 
issue, causal factors. 

As should be clear by now, the causes and 
pathways to youth suicide are multifactorial- 
a set of conditions on which my colleagues 
will elaborate further, and to which we will 
return shortly. Hence, to search for a specific 
etiology or specific set of causal factors seems 
somewhat futile and based more on our 
desire to emulate medical treatment of dis- 
ease than on our understanding of the 
phenomena with which we are concerned. 
Indeed, even the medical establishment has 
embraced the concept of health promotion 
targeted at alleviating broadband risk factors 
as a major weapon. For us to include such a 
strategy under the rubric of prevention is 
neither inappropriate nor incorrect. To the 
extent that specific causal factors can be 
identified, we are generally able to do so only 
on a case-by-case basis. But, by this time, we 
believe we are far past anything that may be 
construed as primary prevention. Although 
we may intervene in specific c&us u factors 
and call this effort prevention, in that it may 
result in the individual's retreating from a 



lethal attempt, in every other sense the inter- 
vention would be labelled by the medical es- 
tablishment as heroic care and late 
intervention. Further, if we wait until 
specific causal or predictive factors are clear- 
ly present, the timing and targeting of the in- 
terventions can be determined only at the 
level of the individual case. That is not to say 
that such efforts are not critical to reducing 
youth suicide, but they are not primary 
prevention and attempting to label them as 
such will simply make the already murky con- 
ceptual waters even less penetrable. 

Necessaiy conditions also seem easy to deal 
with. The youth needs both the means and 
the opportunity to engage in a lethal attempt. 
The availability of firearms, access to motor 
vehicles, "inviting" high places, and certain 
drugs may increase the probability of a suc- 
cessful attempt. At this point, we should also 
recognize that just as a knowledge of what 
dosage, height, or weapon is required for a 
lethal attempt, a lack of such knowledge fre- 
quently may move what was meant to be an 
attention- seeking gesture into the realm of 
a lethal attempt. Education and access are 
critical, at both the individual level, e.g., in 
the home, and through policy efforts, such as 
gun control and efforts to reduce teenage 
drinking or »^*?' ^nce abuse and driving. We 
hope our working groups will attend to these 
issues in developing their recommendations. 

In attempting to deal with the more general 
antecedents of youth suicide-predisposing 
conditions and precipitating conditions- 
there appear to be more opportunities for 
true primary prevention, at least when con- 
trasted to the specific etiology approach. As 
noted above, we may be required to decide 
first whether youth suicide is a specific 
phenomenon or part of more general be- 
havioral or emotional problems such as 
depression, acting-out problems, risk-taking 
behaviors, and other self-injurious behaviors 
such as alcohol and substance abuse. It may 
be that we decide thatsuicide is both, i.e., that 
it has a large degree of share J variance with 
these other conditions as well as its own 
unique attributes, especially the intentional

use of lethal methods. Certainly, any 
clinician who has spent more than a few 
hours with adolescent clients and has seen 
their depression and sadnw... following the 
break-up with a boyfriend or girlfriend, or 
after a fight with their parents, knows the fre- 
quency with which they voice the wish to die 
out of revenge or for dramatic effect, is not 
low. Thus, if we fmd that the antecedents of 
some youth suicides are much the same as 
conditions predispxssing to depression or ac- 
ting-out behaviors, it should not surprise us. 
Indeed, one only has to remember adoles- 
cence and the verbalizations or judgments of 
our own friends to be surprised that more 
youth do not actually kill themselves. These 
observations make us realize that we should 
focus more attention on why more youth do 
not engage in suicidal behaviors, i.e., what 
conditions make them less vulnerable. To 
direct our inquiry and develop a greater un- 
derstanding of the antecedents to youth 
suicide requires a perspective on prevention 
that will guide the questions we ask and will 
systematize the answers we obtain. 

Elsewhere (Felner, Farber, & Primavera, 
1983; Felner, Ginter, & Primavera, 1982; 
Felner & Lorion, 1985), the senior author of 
this paper and his colleagues as well as others 
(e.g., Lorioii, 1983; Seidman, 1986) have 
begun to elaborate a model that we believe 
helps to meet these needs and is especially 
appropriate for the prevention of youth 
suicide given what we have discussed thus far. 
The model deHnes preventive interventions 
within a developmental framework and will 
allow us to view the f\ili range of levels of 
preventive interventions for youth suicide. 
Within this model, a preventive intervention 
involves systematically altering the processes 
related to 1) the development of adaptation 
and well-being and 2) the evolution of dys- 
function. The goals, quite clearly, enhance 
the former processes and reduce the latter 
processes that are experienced by children 
and adolescents. Further, given the em- 
phasis accorded to the processes underlying 
the evolution of a specific disorder or set of 
adaptive difficulties, a developmental model 
that is transactional in nature (such as that of 



Sameroff and Chandler, 1975), and that em- 
phasizes the necessity of understanding the 
ecological context in which the child or 
adolescent is attempting to adapt, is clearly 
the paradigm of choice for moving toward 
more specific variables of concern. Such a 
transactional-ecologicai perspective em- 
phasizes that dynamic transactions between 
individual and environmental factors lead to 
health or disorder, and specifying "a path" is 
not an outcome we should seek. Rather, 
specifying ways of understanding the 
relevant processes are of paramount impor- 
tance. Moreover, to paraphrase Sarason and 
Doris (1979), it is worth emphasizing from a 
transactional perspective, that the individual 
and his environment can never be under- 
stood separately.. .from a transactional 
perspective the direction of the developmen- 
tal influences is always reciprocal. 

A brief example of how this approach may be 
combined with our notions of predisposing 
and precipitating factors to understand youth 
suicide may be helpful ' ere. One of the "hot" 
media issues of the past few years has been 
"cluster" suicides among youths in the same 
school or town. The predisposing conditions 
for the youths who follow the first suicide 
may be depression or other psychiatric 
problems, low family support and/or a high 
degree of alienation from friends and family. 
All of these conditions both contribute to and 
are contributed by the emotional problems 
present. Children's feelings of not belonging 
in school or having a restricted future be- 
cause of doing ixx)rly in school may have 
similar impact. These latter conditions might 
result from the social climate of the school, 
its structure, or recent school transitions im- 
posed by the system. Thus, individual, fami- 
ly system, and broader social system (e.g., 
peer/school) factors may all contribute to 
predisposing the adolescent to be vulnerable 
at this time. Nonetheless, these adolescents 
in general, have not yet considered suicide 
seriously or attempted it as a solution to their 
adaptive difficulties. Indeed, they may have 
attained relative equilibrium, however un- 
satisfactory, in their coping efforts.

Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



Into this pot we put not only the model of 
another adolescent demonstrating that 
suicide may be an alternative coping strategy, 
but the response of the social system to that 
event. For a lonely, highly stressed adoles- 
cent, with the particularly strong needs for 
identity and acceptance that characterize this 
age, the overwhelming attention and grief 
that the system and other persons pay to the 
suicide, may be sufficiently attractive and 
satisfying to many of the adolescent's im- 
mediate needs at a level that results in dis- 
equilibrium and, in turn, precipitates an 
attempt. It is this change in equilibrium 
which seems to discriminate between those 
who make a lethal attempt from those who 
do not, and for whom it is so difficult to 
specify a distal causal pathway. In this situa- 
tion, more proximal factors seem more 
salient. If access to lethal means is relatively 
easy (e.g., if guns and ammunition are avail- 
able in the home), the probability increases 
that a momentary, impulsive act may occur. 
Similarly, anything which enhances the at- 
tractiveness of suicide as a coping strategy 
may also tip the scales (e.g., another incident 
with resulting publicity, a fight with one's 
parents or significant other, etc.). That en- 
vironmental factors may contribute here is 
obvious from the pattern that seems to indi- 
cate that cluster suicides tend to be less com- 
mon in large systems (e.g., schools, towns) 
where anonymity is greater, where there may 
be less publicity, and the possible pay-off, in 
terms of the adolescent's own developmen- 
tal issues, seems less certain or clear. This ex- 
ample illustrates the very complex interplay 
of developmental and environmental cir- 
cumstances and the individual's own limited 
range of coping ability. Further, we see that: 
(1) both predisposing and/or precipitating 
conditions may be necessary for many youth 
suicides to occur and; (2) even when both sets 
of conditions are present, in most instances, 
suicide does not occur. Perhaps even more 
ironic is that children experiencing these 
conditions may be more "at risk" in systems in 
which we might assume lower risk, i.e., small, 
cohesive ones. Similar examples may be 
developed for the high rate of suicides among 



children who seem to be doing very well 
academically or socially (Maris, 1985) as well 
as those who are more obvious risks for the 
full array of psychological and self-injurious 
diCGculties that plague adolescents. 

The above may make it seem as if primary 
prevention programs targeted to youth 
suicide will have little pay-off and that broad 
scope suicide prevention programs may ac- 
tually influence the actions of only a small 
group of children. We would like to argue 
that such views are short-sighted but, given 
base rates, perhaps natural conclusions will 
result from specific etiology or specific out- 
come-targeted prevention programs. What 
we mean is, if we develop broad-based 
prevention programs for the prevention of 
youth suicide, with our only goal being the 
reduction of actual cases of suicide, the very 
limited resources available for medical and 
mental health programs may force us to con- 
clude that what little funding is directed 
toward prevention c*' youth suicide may be 
better spent. 

What strikes us as particularly ironic is that 
although other federal agencies such as the 
Department of Defense and NASA take 
pains to convince us that we get far more for 
our dollar, especially our R&D dollar, than 
the targeted "product", we in human services, 
at least at this time, are going the other way. 
We fail to see the harm in reducing the in- 
cidence of school failure, adolescent depres- 
sion, non-lethal suicide attempts, and the rest 
of the range of health-risk behaviors that 
adolescents engage in, while we also attempt 
to reduce the suicide rate. Indeed, if we fol- 
low the model we have advanced above, such 
multiple-outcome effects seem expected 
and, if the programs are effective, un- 
avoidable. Documenting the positive as well 
as negative, but unintended or "ancillary" 
consequences of suicide prevention 
programs should not be discouraged. In- 
deed, studying the full range of outcomes as- 
sociated with such programs may provide 
important clues on how to maximize our ef- 
fectiveness in the prevention of youth suicide 
perse.

R.D.Felner: Primary Prevention... 



Kone implements the preceding transaction- 
al model with the goal of reducing antece- 
dent or predisposing conditions and 
influencing the individual's threshold of vul- 
nerability to these conditions in addition to 
preventingyouth suicide per se, then the lack 
of information specific to the effective 
prevention of youth suicide becomes less of 
a barrier to action. Programs which repre- 
sent both levels of primary prevention, as 
outlined by Cowen (1985), may be effective 
as well as essential for dealing with youth 
suicide. The first level is sysiem-focused with 
the emphasis on understanding and modify- 
ing the multiple social systems that affect the 
mental health and well-being of individuals 
in ways that reduce stress and increase life 
opportunities. Examples that have been 
powerful influences on the general mental 
health and well-being of adolescents are a) 
policy interventions which increase the sense 
of control youth feel they have over their fu- 
tures, b) modifications of major ecosystems 
in which adolescents must function, such as 
schools, and/or c) efforts at grass-roots level 
interventions, such as the much publicized 
group of New York city students receiving 
free college educations from an alumnus of 
their grade school. 

Similarly, second-level primary prevention 
programs, which are more person-focused, 
may also be effective in achieviiig our goals. 
Rather than influencing the individual's 
threshold of vulnerability by making systems 
to which a person must aaapt less difficult or 
reducing the levels of challenge that the en- 
vironment poses so that the adolescent's pre- 
existing competencies may ensure 
well-being, second-leve: programs seek to 
enhance the problem-solving and coping 
skills of the individual more directly. Educa- 
tion programs, skill-building curricula, and 
resource/support networks may accomplish 
these goals. 

Both strategies may be applied to either 
general populations of youth or youth in 
specific high-risk circumstances, e.g., school 
transitions, parental divorce, households 



with a parent with serious emotional distur- 
bance. The elaboration of the specific sys- 
tems, competencies and vulneraKlities that 
need addressing, and the definition of the 
predisposing and/or precipitating conditions 
that may be appropriately "co-targeted" with 
youth suicide, we leave to our colleagues. 

For the general purposes of prevention, if we 
adopt a developmental-transactional- 
ecological perspective, several points need to 
be addressed further: 

1. When and how do we identify a child or 
adolescent who is the appropriate concern 
of a primary prevention program for youth 
suicide? 

2. Are antecedent conditions the ap- 
propriate and/or necessary targets of such 
programs? Are adolescent suicide and the 
search for specific etiologies the only con- 
ditions with which we should concern our- 
selves? 

3. If we choose broad-based preventive ap- 
proaches, as we propose, how can we draw 
on our understanding of general develop- 
mental data and models, as well as preven- 
tion programs that have been developed 
for less focused outcomes, such as as the 
problem-solving approach c*" Spivak and 
Shure and the senior author's own transi- 
tion program efforts, to implement and 
evaluate effective primary prevention ef- 
forts.

INTRODUCTION 

The Purpose of this Review 

The principal goal of this review is to identify 
studies which have used reasonable 
methodologies to evaluate the success, or 
otherwise, of prevention activities in youth 
suicide. We have, however, identified no 
such studies. Given the quantity of preven- 
tive activity that is being conducted, this is a 
matter of concern. Rather than simply con- 
cluding that the lack of research is critical in 
this area, we have extended this in airy to 
summarize what is known about the value of 
su'vide prevention activities for other age 
groups. Many activities intended for adults 
may also be appropriate for teenagers; we 
hope this review will provide some guidelip.;^ 
for those concerned with preventing teen 
suicide. 

General reviews of the suicide prevention 
literature which the reader may find valuable, 
include Motto et al., 1974; McGee, 1974; 
Stelmachers, 1976; Auerbach and Kilmann, 
1977; Stein and Lambert, 1984. 

Defining Prevention 

The classification of suicide prevention fol- 
lows the classification of suicidal behaviors. 



If suicidal thoughts, attempts, and comple- 
tions are on a psychological or behavioral 
continuum, as common sense would suggest, 
then primary prevention efforts should be 
broadly directed, aiming to reduce all suicide 
morbidity including threats and attempts, for 
all are signs of suicide potential. On the 
other hand if attempts and completions are 
separate but overlapping entities a^* has been 
by proposed by Stengel and Cook (1958), 
Neuringer (1962) and others, and if only a 
minority of those who attempt or threaten 
suicide reai^y want to die, then the focus of 
"primary prevention" should be that sub- 
group of attempters or threateners who bear 
a "high risk" profile for later completion. 

This question is sufficiently important that it 
is worth considering the evidence for the con- 
tinuous versus the separate theories of 
suicide and attempted suicide. 

Demographic Differences Between 
Suicide and Attempted Suicide. 

The case for the two disorder hypothesis 
relies on both the manifest ambivalence of 
many survivors and the marked demographic 
differences between suicide attempters and 



3-31

Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



completers which have been shown in most 
studies (Dublin, 1963; Sainsbury, 1955; Ken- 
nedy etal, 1974). Suicide attempts are more 
common in females than in males whereas 
suicide, especially in the young is more com- 
mon in males than females. In our current 
New York study, the ratio of males to females 
for under 19year olds is approximately 4:1 for 
completed suicides. National statistics for 
1981 reveal a male'.female ratio of 4.35:1 
among 15-24 year olds, and 3.6:1 for the total 
population of all ages. Although these statis- 
tics rely upon medical examiners' determina- 
tions, there is evidence that more aggressive 
case finding methods do not materially alter 
the ratio (Kennedy et al., 1974). 

Another demographic index which is 
believed to discriminate between attempts 
and completions is AGE. Studies under- 
taken 2 to 3 decades ago indicated that the 
incidence of suicide attempts peaked in the 
teens and early twenties (Kennedy et al., 
1974) and then declined, whereas completed 
suicide became increasingly common with 
advancing age. This age discrepancy has now 
diminished, at least for males, as completed 
suicide is now more common in younger than 
in older males and no evidence suggests that 
the previously identified pattern of high in- 
cidence of suicide attempts among the young 
has changed. 

While the epidemiological data are undoub- 
tedly accurate, one cannot infer from them 
that the outcome of suicidal behavior, i.e., 
whether it is successful or unsuccessful, 
defines two differ?nt conditions. This is be- 
cause both age and sex are related to method 
preference which in turn, is closely tied to 
outcome. 

Age-related method preference is not well 
documented, but what evidence exists sug- 
gests younger children and teenagers over- 
dose with less lethal drugs than adults. 
Morgan et al. (1975) found that teens most 
commonly overdosed with over-the-counter 
analgesics, whereas older patients favored 
more dangerous psychoactive drugs (usually 



obtained by legitimate prescription from a 
physician). This difference might be ex- 
pected to result in a smaller proportion of 
suicides attributable to overdoses in the 
young, which is precisely what is found 
(Centers for Disease Control, 1985). 

Females are more likely to take an overdose 
(Weissman, 1974), males to use Hrearms or 
to hang themselves. Given current medical 
skills, overdose is generally an ineffective way 
to commit suicide. It could be argued (and 
usually is) that these differences in method 
preference arise because suicidal females are 
less motivated to die and knowingly choose 
less lethal methods. The difference in lethal 
intention is cited as further evidence of a two 
disorder hypothesis. 

It may be, however, that the sexes are similar 
in their (generally ambivalent) motivation to 
die, and that choice of method is a sex-related 
behavior. That is, the sex differences be- 
tween completed and attempted suicide may 
not reflect different degrees of intention, but 
rather that when the sexes feel suicidal they 
do different things about it. These different 
things, at least in North America and 
Western Europe, have a high probability of 
leading to death in boys and a low one in girls. 
Interestingly, a report of consecutive suicides 
in India (Sathyavati, 1975) shows no sex dif- 
ferential, suicides being as common in 
teenage girls as in boys. One could speculate 
that this occurs because resuscitation 
methods are less effective in that country. 

The gender association of method could be a 
sex-specific behavior preference without 
psychopathological significance; or, it could 
be mediated by difference in psychopathol- 
ogy in suicidal males and females. Some 
evidence supports this. In our New York 
study we find high rates of aggressive and an- 
tisocial behavior and relatively low rates of 
pure major depressive disorder in boys who 
have suicided, but the reverse in girls. One 
cannot infer from this difference, however, 
that intention to die is different in the two 
conditions.

D.Shaffer: A Critical Review of Preventive Intervention.. 



Direct Evidence for Continuity 
Between Suicldai Thoughts and 
Behaviors. 

Paykel et al. (1974) in their New Haven study 
of a household probability sample of adults, 
posed questions about different degrees of 
suicidal ideation and behavior. These were 
strongly interrelated in a hierarchical 
fashion. Almost all subjects with more 
severe symptoms had experienced those that 
were less severe. More interesting for the 
present argument is that the correlates of dif- 
ferent levels of severity were similar. In- 
dividuals who wished they were dead 
resembled those who had actually made a 
suicide attempt (the two extreme* of the con- 
tinuum) with respect to both demographics 
and associated symptoms. Pfeffer et al. 
(1984) reports similar findings in school 
children. Those who had thought of dying 
were as deviant as those who had made a 
suicide attempt and showed a similar profile 
of associated symptoms. 

There is also evidence for overlap between 
suicide attempts and completions. Most 
retrospective psychological autopsy studies 
show prior attempt rates of between 30 per- 
cent and 50 percent (Shaffer, 1974; Kennedy 
et al., 1974; Robins et al., 1959; Dorpat & 
Ripley, 1960; Barraclough et al., 1970). Con- 
versely, followup studies of attempters show 
suicide rates 50-60 times that in the general 
population. 

Poor Predictive Specificity of 
Attempter Characteristics. 

If attempters and completers are drawn from 
the same population, we would expect dif- 
ficulty in predicting future completions 
among suicide attempters. Although not ex- 
tensively studied, the evidence supports this 
prediction. Motto's (1984) 5 to 15 year fol- 
lowup of teenagers admitted to hospitals 
after an attempt or with serious depression 
showed that although certain factors were 
proportionally more common in those who 
would go on to suicide, the same factors were 
numerically many times more common in at- 



tempters who would not, i.e., the base rate in 
non-completers was high and there were no 
pathognomonic features for later comple- 
tions. 

The same has been found in followup studies 
of adults where, not only demographic 
characteristics, but the extent to which the 
suicide attempt could be judged to be serious 
(i.e., isolation during the commission of the 
attempt and its medical seriousness) were not 
predictive of later death (Greer and Lee, 
1967). Discriminant function studies which 
identify differentiating characteristics in 
suicides and attempters (Pallis ct al., 1982) 
draw upon different population bases, and it 
is not clear whether the apparent inde- 
pendence is a function of different condi- 
tions or different population frames. 

Suicide Accelerators Affect Both 
Deaths and Attempts. 

We cite evidence below (Gould and Shaffer, 
1986) that certain television programs which 
dramatize the plight of the suicidal teenager 
serve to increase both suicidal deaths and 
suicide attempts. 

COMMENTS: Given these uncertainties it 
seems wisest to adopt a conservative ap- 
proach and regard any suicidal behavior as 
presaging completion. Primary prevention 
would prevent the initial occurrence of 
suicidal ideation or behavior; secondary 
prevention would prevent non-lethal suicidal 
behavior from progressing to death. 

We have adopted this approach in organiz- 
ing this paper and have grouped as primary 
preventions: 

1. Altering the set towards suicide in unaf- 
fected individuals by, for example, provid- 
ing information on suicide behaviors in 
classes to normal non-disturbed school- 
children, or in special services for sur- 
vivors. 

2. Early identification and treatment of con- 
ditions which are known to predispose 
towards suicidal behavior, before suicide is 
contemplated.

Secondaiy preventions should reduce the 
potential for completion among those who 
have already threatened or attempted 
suicide, through: 

1. Removal of the means for committing 
suicide. 

2. Emergency crisis interventions at times of 
maximal distress. 

3. Ongoing treatment after the crisis has 
passed. 

PRIMARY PREVENTION 

Preventing Suicidal Beiiavior in 
Vulnerable Groups 

General Psychiatric Care 

We have argued above that the feature most 
likely to be shared by suicides is a history of 
mental illness. It follows, other things being 
equal, that the introduction of psychiatric 
services to a community should reduce the 
burden of mental illness and with it the 
suicide rate. This has not been found to be 
the case. 

Neilson and Videbech (1973) examined the 
impact on suicide rates (all ages) of the intro- 
duction of a psychiatric service to the island 
of Samso off the coast of Denmark. There 
were no differences in suicide rates during 
the S years before and after the introduction 
of the service. Similarly Walk (1967) ex- 
amined suicide rates in the county of Sussex 
in Great Britain before and after the intro- 
duction of a community service and found no 
effect on suicide rates. 

COMMENTS: These studies are often cited 
as evidence that psychiatric treatment does 
not reduce suicid*- morbidity. However, 
neither of the studies had a control and so it 
is possible that apparently stable rates were 
occurring at a time of a more general rate in- 
crease. This is unlikely to be true in the Walk 
study however, because at the tiir.e, suicide 
rates were declining in Great Britain. More 
importantly the studies were conducted 
before the widespread use of antidepressants 



and lithium and therefore, do not reflect the 
impact of current effective antidepressant 
therapies. 

High Risk Groups 

Prevention would be most efficient if we 
could identify individuals who have both a 
high probability of later suicide and some 
common characteristics which allow them to 
be centrally identified and taken into preven- 
tion programs. 

If we believe that suicide arises because of a 
set of social circumstances or life conditions, 
and that to commit suicide is in any way a 
"reasonable" response to untenable life con- 
ditions, then the high risk group would most 
likely be accessible to social rather than men- 
tal health agencies. However, there is good 
evidence that no matter how understandable 
a suicide may be to an outsider, it is almost al- 
ways a sign of psychopathology. Primary 
prevention is, therefore, most appropriately 
an activity for the mental health professional. 
Brown (1979) summarized this view succinct- 
ly "...although psychiatric disorder may not be 
sufficient cause for suicide in current 
Western cultures, it is a necessary one...". 
The evidence derives from a number of 
sources: 

a. Psychological autopsy studies on repre- 
sentative groups of suicides (Dorpat and 
Ripley, 1960; Robins, 1959; Barracloughet 
al., 1974; Shaffer, 1974) have found very 
few suicides to be free of psychiatric 
symptoms. 

b. There have been similar findings among 
suicide attempters (Morgan et al., 1975; 
Birtchnell and Alarcon, 1971; Silver et al., 
1971). 

c. A majority of suicides have had contact 
with a mental health professional before 
their death. 

d. Followup studies of formerly hospitalized 
psychiatric patients indicate that they have 
significantly higher suicide rates than non- 
patients (Temoche, 1964; Pokomy, 1964, 
1983).

n Shaffer: A Critical Review of Preventive Intervention.. 



e. Super-normal control groups, eated by 
screening out individuals with 
psychopathology have very low suicide 
rates (Winokur and Tsuang, 1975). 

It follows that the most appropriate group foi 
preventive interventions ais individuals with 
current or previous psychiatric disorders~a 
dauntingly large group. However 
psychological 'Wtopsy studies carried out on 
adults have found that a rather narrow range 
of associated psychiatric disorders (affective 
disorder and alcoholism) account for most 
suicides. 

Similarly, diagnostic analyses of child and 
teenage suicides carry the promise of defin- 
ing more specific groups. Shaffer (1974) 
found that a small proportion of suicides 
(predominantly giris) are depressed and that 
a large group show a combination of affective 
and antisocial behaviors. The epidemiologi- 
cally-based study we are currently carrying 
out in the New York metropolitan area will 
provide detailed DSM III related diagnostic 
information on approximately 150 teenage 
and child suicides and will, we suspect, con- 
firm the findings of the other studies. We 
also hope that it will allow us to define the 
suicide group more precisely by seeing 
whether other characteristics such as a fami- 
ly history of suicide, and specific family con- 
stellations and social circumstances, are 
more common in suicides. The highest risk 
group, however, appears to be individuals, 
who have made a prior suicide attempt. 

Suicide Attempters or Depressives 

It is generally assumed that the diagnostic 
group with the highest risk for later suicide 
are individuals suffering from an affective 
disorder. Lists of warning signs generally in- 
clude the symptoms of depression and find- 
ings are generally consistent in adults relating 
suicide to depression. Temoche et al. (1964) 
and Pokomy et al. (1964) both found that 
suicide was significantly more common in 
previously hospitalized patients who had 
received a psychiatric diagnosis of depressive 
psychosis. Robins (1959), reviewing studies 
which mainly dated from before the 



widespread use of lithium and antidepres- 
sants computed an overall IS percent suicide 
rate for manic depressives. However, our 
work with adolescents (Shaffer, 1974) sug- 
gests that only a minority of suicides show a 
picture of uncomplicated depression and 
that the largest diagnostic group comprises 
youngsters with both aggressive and antiso- 
cial symptoms and depression. 

Depression may not be a very specific group 
for later suicide. Major Depressive Disorder 
(MDD) has an estimated one year 
prevalence of 2,000/100,000 in adolescence 
(Anderson et al., 1985; Weissman et al., 1985; 
Kashaai et al., 1983). In our current New 
York study we have found that only 25 per- 
cent of suicides meet criteria for Major 
Depressive Disorder giving a one year in- 
cidence of 3/100,000. In one year the ratio of 
depressed teenagers to depressed suicides 
would be approximately 660:1 (higher for 
females). This high risk group would not only 
identify many false positives, but also non- 
specific in failing to identify approximately 75 
percent of suicidal deaths. 

Attempted suicide would seem to be a better 
bet, although not strictly within the domain 
of primaiy prevention. We have already 
referred to studies that found that a sig- 
nificant proportion of suicides made a pre- 
vious known suicide attempt, i.e., the 
attributable risk among suicides for prior at- 
tempted suicides is high. The relative risk 
among attempted suicides for later suicide is, 
perhaps, a more important statistic. If there 
i in effective way of aborting the natural his- 
tory of suicide attempters which terminates 
in suicide, this ratio will indicate the mag- 
nitude of the task. 

One way of finding this out is to examine the 
relative frequency of suicide and suicide at- 
tempts in an unselected population. We 
have found no studies which have generated 
age and sex-specific attempt and suicide rates 
for the same area. Rough and ready calcula- 
tions can be done and we have tabulated data 
from studies into the incidence of suicide at- 
tempts. Paykel (1974) found a one-year 
prevalence of suicide attempts of 



40 



3-35 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



600/100,000 (The prevalence of suicidal 
ideation was 9000/100,000). Johnson et al. 
(1973), in a survey in London, Ontario found 
an attempt rate of 750 to 1,500/100,000. 
Given an overall suicide rate of 12/100,000 in 
adolescents this would put the ratio of at- 
tempts to deaths at 50 to 120: 1 . These figures 
are not corrected for age or multiple at- 
tempts and it is expected that the ratio would 
vary in different age and sex groups, being . 
higher in teenage girls. Nevertheless these 
ratios are a good deal lower than those for 
major depressive disorder (MDD). 

A better strategy is to identify all of the 
known attempts within a given geographical 
area. Studies approaching this goal, which 
have included studies of non-accidental drug 
overdoses by Morgan et al. (1975) in the 
British city of Bristol and Daly et al. (1986) in 
the Irish city of Cork, generated age-speciOc 
attempt rates. Neither study evaluated 
suicide attempts treated by non-clinic based 
general practitioners and both confined their 
study to overdoses. The rates are therefore 
likely to be an underestimate of the true rate. 

However, if the same attempt rates prevailed 
in the United States it might appear that be- 
tween 30 and 50 attempts at suicide for every 
completed male suicide, and between 150 
and 300 suicide attempts for every completed 
female suicide. These would provide quite 
reasonable rates for focusing on an at-risk 
population. 

Suicides, however, are not drawn uniquely 
from the pool of known suicide attempters. 
Studies in different age groups and in dif- 
ferent countries are surprisingly consistent in 
showing that only between 25 and 40 percent 
of suicides have made a previously known 
suicide attempt. These rates were found by 
Shaffer both in his British study of children 
under age 15 (1974) and in his U.S. study of 
predominantly older teenagers. Similar rates 
were reported for adult suicides in the U.S. 
(Dorpat and Ripley, 1960; Robins et al., 
1959) in England (Barraciough et al., 1974) 
and in Scotland (Kennedy et al., 1974). 
(There is as yet no information about 
whether the proportion of deaths at- 



tributable to prior attempts varies with sex or 
ethnicity.) 

The ratios of attempts to completions should, 
therefore, be modiHed and minimum es- 
timates would range from around 60:1 for 
older male teenagers to approximate^ 600:1 
foryounger female teenagers. These are for- 
midable ratios and certainly indicate that if 
we can find out how best to treat these 
patients we should put most emphasis on 
male adolescents generally and older ones 
most specifically. 

Case Finding 

Effective prevention requires that vul- 
nerable groups be identified and apprised of 
the preventive intervention. Although many 
adult suicides are known to be in contact with 
a treating physician shortly before their 
death (see below), this finding may not apply 
to children and teenagers. Preventive efforts 
for this age group have characteristically con- 
centrated on identifying potentially vul- 
nerable cases in schools or through the public 
media. 

Case Finding Through Physicians 

It appears that many adult suicides contact 
their physicians shortly before their death, 
suggesting that preventive identification 
channeled through primary health providers 
may be effecti'-*'- 

Barraciough et al. (1974), in their British 
study of 100 consecutive suicide completers 
found that just under 50 percent had visited 
their physician during the week before their 
suicide. Murphy et al. (1975) and Motto and 
Greene (1958), in their study of previously 
hospitalized suicide attempters and depres- 
sives found that a high proportion of suicides 
(all ages, predominantly adult) had visited a 
physician shortly before their suicide, 17 per- 
cent in the month before death. The dif- 
ference could be due to the ex-patients' 
insight into the psychiatric nature of their 
condition, or to the different nature of the 
health services in Britain (with minimal char- 
ges and universal enrollment with a primary

physician) compared to the United States. 

The same is true in the case of attempted 
suicides. Motto and Greene (1958) reported 
that 60 percent of suicide attempters had 
consulted a physician during the 6 months 
before their death. Johnson et al. (1973), in 
a followup of 878 attempter cases, found that 
55 percent had seen their physician during 
the month before their death. Morgan et al. 
(1975) found that 21 percent of a sample of 
consecutive suicide attempts seen at an 
emergency room in Bristol had contacted 
their physician during the week before thei* 
attempt and more than half had done so 
within three months of their death. 

Studies are also consistent in showing that 
the physicians contacted are not aware of 
their patient's suicide potential. In Murphy's 
series, two-thirds of the suicides had a prior 
history of suicide threats or attempts, yet only 
40 percent of their physicians knew this. A 
high proportion of the attempters in 
Johnson's study had made a previous suicide 
attempt, but again, only 20 percent of the af- 
fected physicians knew of this. 

Motto (1969) has suggested that physicians' 
own anxiety about suicide or about handling 
a potentially suicidal situation inhibit them 
from making appropriate inquiries. Johnson 
suggested that physicians tend to view suicide 
attempts in the same light as alcoholism, as a 
repetitive self-induced disorder for which 
they can do little in the face of absence of 
motivation by the patient. 

We do not know if the same is true for 
teenagers, but clearly it would be advisable 
for physicians to inquire routinely whether 
any depressed or suicidal patient has made a 
previous attempt, has ever been hospitalized 
for a psychiatric condition, or is a heavy user 
of alcohol or drugs, all factors which appear 
to increase the probability of suicide. 

Case Finding Through School-based Programs 
Description of School Programs 

School-based intervention programs are be- 
coming increasingly common, often being es- 



tablished by loc il or State legislation, as a 
result of community pressure, following a 
wave of suicides. Most aim to: 

a. Increase the sensitivity of responsible in- 
dividuals within the school to the features 
of the suicide-prone child. Methods in- 
clude lectures, videotaped interviews with 
teenagers who have made a previous 
suicide attempt, small discussion groups, 
and the distribution of lists of "early warn- 
ing signs". 

b. Provide information about special resour- 
ces where pupils suspected of being at risk 
may be referred for treatment or help. 

c. Provide some training in the behavioral 
skills that teachers, counsellors or other 
pupils can use when they identify a child at 
risk. The goal is to establish a relationship 
of trust and support with the child at risk, 
encourage open communication of trou- 
bling thoughts, and make it easier for the 
child at risk to accept a referral to a 
specialist resource. 

d. Lower the constraints children and 
teenagers have about discussing suicidal 
thoughts and preoccupations, thus en- 
couraging self disclosure. This may be 
done by raising the subject in open group 
discussions, sometimes with known dis- 
turbed youngsters in attendance (Ross and 
Motto, 1984). These discussions may take 
place in large assemblies, in smaller groups 
of 10 to 20 students, or in the context of a 
regular class. 

Such programs are variously addressed to 
groups of school personnel, parents, and/or 
students. Some school districts have ex- 
pressed reluctance to offer "suicide educa- 
tion" to students and have, instead, 
developed programs or curricula dealing with 
the more general topic of adolescent stress. 

Evaluation of School Programs 

One of the most striking features of this 
review is the almost complete absence of any 
systematic evaluation of in-school programs. 

Ottens (1984) describes responses to a ques- 
tionaire distributed before and after a 4 hour 



4 2 3-37 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



course to 31 college counselors and students. 
Post-course scores on questions about ap- 
propriate responses to a hypothetical crisis 
situation more closely approximated the 
responses that were taught in the class. Cor- 
relations are described but no statistics are 
presented and there is no evidence that the 
paper and pencil responses are in any way 
representative of real skills. In fact, this 
seems unlikely as student responses were ap- 
parently similar to those of experienced 
therapists. 

Descriptive material prepared by the 
program in Fairfax County, Virginia, notes 
that during its first year of operation there 
were 5 deaths and during the second year 
only 3. It acknowledges that this change 
could be due to coincidence. The publica- 
tion states that the administrators believed 
the program was going well and stated, anec- 
dotally, that since it started, school-based 
counselors had experienced an increase in 
referrals and school staff had become more 
sophisticated in identifying pupils in t .ouble. 
However, as Stein and Lambert (\9fy4) have 
demonstrated, counselors' self-evaluations 
(Apsler and Hoople, 1976; Getz et al., 1975) 
of their own usefulness and efficacy tend to 
be optimistic, are prone to bias, and cannot 
be accepted as reasonable evidence of ef- 
ficacy. 

Ross (1980), describing the San Mateo coun- 
ty program, reports (anecdotally) that the in- 
traduction of the program led to an increase 
in referrals to a suicide prevention program. 
Workers in this field often comment on the 
absence of systematic evaluations, but they 
usually state, with some justification, that 
staff who are excellent at intervening may not 
have the necessary skills to do a sound 
evaluation. Others comment that the 
problem is too urgent to await the results of 
any research evaluation. 

Comments on School Programs 

Given the dearth of systematic evaluation of 
these important programs it is reasonable to 
comment from general principles. 

a. Early warning signs: Most are brief lists 



which emphasize the features of a recent 
op.set of depression, i.e., changes in mood, 
decreasing sociability, decline of school 
performance, increasing irritability, anJ 
some specific behaviors such as making 
suicide threats and giving away possessions. 
They have presumably been based on either 
the collective experience of professionals 
who have investigated individual cases of 
suicide, or on stereotypes. They are not 
derived empirically from representative 
samples, quite simply because no systematic 
descriptions of the natural history of changes 
prior to death exist for teenagers. 

We hope that when the New York study has 
been completed that we will be able to 
provide this type of information. However, 
at first sight, the traditional warning signs do 
not fit the large number of cases we have seen 
who have longstanding behavior and 
academic problems and were often frequent 
users of drugs and alcohol. Only a minority 
present h picture of recent onset of a major 
depressive disorder. 

Given that lists of signs which do not em- 
phasize the chronically disturbed youngster 
may be ineffective because they do not iden- 
tify the cases at greatest risk, might the lists 
be harmful? As stated above, epidemiologi- 
cal studies indicate a one year prevalence of 
depression in teenagers of 1 to 3 percent 
(Weissman et al., 1985; Anderson, 1985; 
Kashani et al., 1983). The one year incidence 
of teen suicide is around 12/100,000, i.e. in 
one year, depression affects 1,000 to 3,000 
times more teenagers than suicide. Linking 
the common problem of depression to the 
uncommon one of suicide may serve to ex- 
pedite referrals and increase compliance 
with treatment, but it may also introduce the 
notion ofsuicide as an appropriate response 
to teenagers who were not suicidal. We em- 
phasize that there is no evidence either way 
on this point, but we believe it is an impor- 
tant question that needs to be answered. 

b. Promoting discussion of suicide in class: 
Enough evidence suggests that young people 
imitate actual and fantasized suicide to war- 
rant concern about this technique. The

evidence includes: 

1. Phillips* (1979) demonstration that 
prominent display of the news of a suicide 
leads to an increase in suicidal deaths 
during the period immediately following 
the display. (Only two weeks ago we par- 
ticipated in a case conference on an eight 
year old child who attempted to stab his ab- 
domen with a kitchen knife, the day after a 
prominent politician committed suicide in 
this way.) In a recent communication Phil- 
lips indicated that most of the excess 
suicides which occur in this context are of 
younger people. 

2. Gould and Shaffer's study of television 
docudramas (see below) has demonstrated 
that these broadcasts have the effect of in- 
creasing teen suicide attempts and deaths. 

3. Xreitman's (1970) observation that young 
attempters had many more close contacts 
with those who had made a suicide attempt 
than non-suicidal psychiatric controls. 

4. The occurrence of suicide clusters which 
are very probably the result of imitation. 

This evidence raises the possibility that class- 
room discussions will, as intended, raise 
awareness of the topic and introduce, de 
novo, suicide in the range of contemplated 
behaviors for the teenage pupil, i.e., that it 
will "put ideas in their head". This risk must 
be weighed against the intended benefit, i.e., 
that it will facilitate disclosure of some pupils' 
pre-existing suicidal preoccupations and that 
this will, in turn, lead to intervention which 
will reduce the risk of suicide. This important 
issue remains unanswered. It is clearly a mat- 
ter of some urgency that quality research be 
undertaken *o determine whether the effects 
are benign or beneficial. 

Case Finding by Television 

Attempts have been made to harness the im- 
pact of television to promote awareness of 
suicidal situations and to encourage ap- 
propriate referral. Holding (1974; 1975) ex- 
amined the impact in Edinburgh of an 
11 -part weekly television series, "The 



C 



Befrienders," which illustrated the predica- 
ment of a suicidal individual who was then 
helped by the Samaritans. During the 
calender year in which the programs were 
shown, referrals to the Samaritans increased 
140 percent. However there was no change 
in the number of attempted suicides treated 
by hospitals in the city. 

The effect on suicide deaths was examined by 
tabi*1ating both suicides and undetermined 
deaths (a group usually considered to consist 
largely of suicides (Holding and Barraclough; 
1978)) during the ten weeks after and the ten 
weeks prior to the series and for the same 
period of time in 4 previous years. In each of 
the previous years the number of suicides had 
declined during those weeks. However, 
during the year under examination the rate 
remained stable. There was no reduction in 
the number of suicides during the broadcast 
of the television series. 

Gould and Shaffer (1986) have examined the 
impact of dramatized television presenta- 
tions of suicide on a youthful audience. Over 
a period of approximately 4 months, the 
major U.S. networks broadcast 4 dramatiza- 
tions of either a young person's suicide or the 
reaction to a suicide in a parent. The 
programs were broadcast with advance 
publicity clearly stating that they were in- 
tended to make the public aware of the 
problem of youth suicide. To a varying de- 
gree they were coordinated with community 
programs. In some cases this took the form 
of advance distribution of informational 
material indicating where treatment for the 
suicidal adolescent was available or material 
for teachers, parents, and teens outlining the 
clinical features which may be present in the 
teenager who may try suicide. In some cases 
the local affiliate arranged for a hotline num- 
ber to be flashed onto the screen at varying 
times during the program. 

The incidence of completed suicides among 
teenagers aged 19 or under was examined in 
the States of Connecticut, New Jersey and 
part of New York State in 14 day blocks 
during the 4 months when the programs were 
shown, and for two one-month periods 



4 4 3-39 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



before the first program and after the last. 
Comparisons were made between the death 
rate during the 14 days before and after each 
program, and between an overall expected 
rate and observed rate after each show. 
Similar comparisons were made of th e num- 
ber of attempted suicides treated at 6 large 
hospitals in the New York City area. 

Suicidal deaths increased signiHcantly during 
the ten days following three of the programs 
but there were no deaths after one of them. 
A similar effect was noted on attempted 
suicides. 

It seemed unlikely that the increased number 
of referrals for suicide attempts was due sole- 
ly to increased awareness or a decreased 
referral threshold for parents or teenagers 
(which might have been expected to increase 
the proportion of minor attempts during the 
after period) because the severity of attempts 
after the programs was similar to those 
before the programs and because the effect 
was on both attempts and suicides. 

It also seemed unlikely that the increased 
number of deaths was due to a bringing for- 
ward of suicides which might have occurred 
anyway. If this had been the case, one would 
have expected to note a reduction in the fre- 
quency of deaths at some point after the 
program, but this was not seen. 

COMMENTS: Television programs are ef- 
fective in publicizing the availability of ser- 
vices. However, they do not reduce the 
number of suicide attempts and may, in fact, 
increase them. They also appear to have a 
provocative effect on suicide deaths. The 
discrepant bindings from one of the programs 
studied by Gould and Shaffer, while not 
statistically significant, is intriguing because 
it holds out the possibility that the dramitaza- 
tion may have special features which prevent 
it from having an unwanted effect and which 
might even have a preventive effect. These 
features could lie in the associated com- 
munity work or in some of the contents of the 
dramatization; this is clearly an important 
area for future research. Finally, the fact that 
the "Befrienders" series resulted in an in- 



creased number of referrals to a crisis service 
without reducing suicide morbidity, suggests 
that crisis services on the model of the 
Samaritans are ineffective in reducing 
suicide morbidity. 

Interventions after a Suicide 

Parent Survivor Groups 

After a teen's suicide, the surviving parents 
and siblings experience signiHcant distress 
and dysfunction. There is also evidence of in- 
creased suicidal morbidity in the surviving 
families (Murphy et al., 1964; Augenbraum 
and Neuringer, 1972), so that postvention 
with survivors may have a preventive func- 
tion. The effects on subsequent suicides may 
be difficult to assess. In the only prospective 
study we know-a five year followup of the 
families of 100 successful suicides-Shepherd 
and Barraclough (1974) found no examples 
of suicidal behavior. 

In practice, "postvention" and prevention ac- 
tivities are frequently carried out by the same 
units. Survivors of suicides are an important 
source of manpower for suicide prevention 
projects and may initiate or give other sup- 
port to these activities. 

We found no studies which specifically set 
out to examine the impact of survivors* 
groups on the subsequent suicidal behavior 
of survivors. In a series of publications, 
Videka-Sherman (1982a; 1982b; Videka- 
Sherman and Leiberman, 1985) examined 
changes in coping responses and mood in 
recently bereaved parents who attended 
meetings organized by "Compassionate 
Friends," a self-help group which provides 
support to parents who have lost » child by 
any type of sudden death. The number of los- 
ses through suicide, if any, is not indicated. 
However, in the absence of other data, the 
findings of the study are reported: 

2,422 parents on the register of several chap- 
ters of Compassionate Friends were sur- 
veyed by mail on two occasions to ascertain 
coping responses to their child's death and to 
elicit depressive and other psychiatric 
symptoms. The response rate was low; only 




3-40

D.Shaffer: A Critical Review of Preventive lnterver)tlon.. 



667 (28%) answered the first survey and only 
391 of these (17% of the original sample) 
provided additional followup information. 
The social demographic distribution of the 
responders indicated that they were 
predominantly white and upper middle class. 

There was no bereaved non-referred control 
group and comparisons were made between 
those who attended several meetings and 
those who either did not choose to attend or 
who dropped out of the program at an early 
stage. Depression scores were not in- 
fluenced by attendance, dropping equally in 
both those who attended and who dropped 
out of group sessions. The coping style most 
likely to be associated with high depression 
scores was an obsessive preoccupation with 
the memory of the child. The coping styles 
associated with best adaptation were immers- 
ing oneself in another activity, or having a re- 
placement child. Attendance at the group 
did not influence the development of either 
of these styles but did enhance altruistic ac- 
tivity which regardless of its beneficial effects 
for society did not, in itself, appear 
therapeutic. 

Rogers et al. (1982) reported an uncon- 
trolled study of a Survivors Support Program 
coordinated professionally but administered 
by volunteers. Groups met in 8 sequential 2 
hour didactic sessions followed by 4 biweek- 
ly discussion groups. The attendees were 
divided evenly between spouses of suicides 
and parents of young suicides. When asked 
to identify their current problems almost all 
indicated that they felt guilty, detached from 
the event, and abandoned. Many idealized 
the deceased. They scored high on the 
somatization, phobic, and obsessive compul- 
sive scales of the SCL-90. At followup 
several weeks after terminating the program, 
33/37 cases were contacted. Most of the par- 
ticipants reported that the program had been 
helpful and showed a decline in SCL-90 
scores. 

COMMENTS: Only limited conclusions can 
be drawn from these studies. Without a con- 
trol group it is not possible to know whether 
the improvement in SCL-90 scores reflects

the natural history of mourning or the effects 
of intervention. Videka-Sherman's studies 
did not specifically examine suicide survivors. 
It namined a self-selected population and 
did not randomly assign eligible survivors to 
group or no group conditions. It therefore 
suffers from all of the drawbacks of any in- 
ference about the effects of an intervention 
that is based on a comparison between com- 
pilers and non-compliers. 

SECONDARY PREVENTION 

Reducing the Lethality of Suicidal 
Behaviors 

With the sole exception of suicide by hang- 
ing, which in 1981 accounted for 40 percent 
of all suicides among U.S. boys under age 14, 
but for only about 20 percent of male suicides 
in older age groups, the methods used by 
young children and adolescents are very 
siknilar to those used by older individuals of 
the same sex (CDC, 1985). Preferred 
methods also vary in different countries and 
appear to be generally stable across time. It 
is, therefore, reasonable to expect that an at- 
tempt to reduce accessibility to, or to im- 
prove the treatment of the outcome of any 
common method, should reduce the suicide 
rate in general and have impact on teenagers. 

The British experience is an example of how 
reducing access to the means of suicide can 
have a significant effect on reducing the 
suicide rate. Starting in 1957, the mean carb- 
on monoxide content of domestic gas was 
reduced from 12 percent to 2 percent 
through the introduction of natural gas and 
modifications in the conversion process from 
coal. The process was completed by 1970. 
Prior to these changes, self asphyxiation with 
domestic cooking gas accounted for more 
than 40 percent of all British suicides and for 
an even higher proportion of male suicides 
(Hassall and Trethowan, 1972; Kreitman, 
1976). 

During the period of gas content change, 
British suicide rates from carbon monoxide 
asphyxiation declined precipitously, account- 
ing for fewer than 10 percent of all suicides 



3-41 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



by 1971. Furthermore, the overall suicide 
rate declined by 26 percent and analysis of 
death by di£ferent methods showed that al- 
most all of this reduction could by attributed 
to a fall in deaths from domestic gas asphyxia- 
tion. 

What appears t o have happened was that the 
suicidal population, denied 9ccess to a 
universally available, non-deforming, non- 
violent method, did not then turn to other 
more violent (and more lethal) methods, but 
instead chose another non-violent method 
which was similarly, readily available-self- 
poisoning. The incidence of suicide attempts 
from overdoses increases markedly during 
this period (Johns, 1977). The impact of this 
change of method on suicide deaths appears 
to have been dampened because over the 
same period self-poisoning became progres- 
sively less lethal, in part because of the sub- 
stitution of the less dangerous 
benzodiazepine drugs for the highly toxic 
barbiturates, and in part because of improved 
methods of resuscitation. Most significantly, 
however, British rates, in contrast to those in 
all other countries, have remained at the new 
lower level (Farberow, 1985). 

The detoxification of domestic cooking gas 
also occurred in other countries in Europe, 
specifically the Netheriands, where it was not 
associated with any reduction in rate. In 
these other countries, however, the base rate 
of self asphyxiation from domestic gas before 
its composition had been changed, was noi 
considerably lower than it had been in 
Britain, (%) and the expected impact was 
proportionately less. 

COMMENTS: Prevention methods that do 
not require the active participation of the 
public have traditionally been the most effec- 
tive (e.g., changing the water supply in South 
London at the time of the great London 
cholera epidemics). It appears to have good 
potential for prev ention in suicide as well. 
The importance of improved methods for 
treating suicir'ie attempts may be the reason 
for the sex-specific changes in the suicide rate 
in the United States. Suicides have been in- 
creasing only for males. It may be that at a 



time when suicide morbidity (i.e., the number 
of suicidal behaviors including both attempts 
and completions) is increasing in both sexes 
(Weissman, 1974; O'Brien, 1977), the impact 
has only been felt by males who favor 
methods for which treatments have not im- 
proved. The increase in female attempts is 
compensated for by improved treatment 
methods for self-poisoning, the preferred 
method. 

Care During a Crisis 

Individuals who have already attempted 
suicide or expressed suicidal thoughts or 
wishes, seem to be an optimal target for 
suicide prevention efforts. 

1. They are at high risk. Most post-mortem 
studies show that between 30 percent and 
50 percent of suicides have made a prior at- 
tempt; the suicide rate in followup studies 
varies from just under 1 percent to nearly 
10 percent, over 100 times the risk carried 
by the general population. 

2. They are potentially easy to identify for it 
seems that most visit an emergency room 
after their attempt (Kennedy, Kreitman 
and Ovenstone, 1974), and many will be 
admitted to a hospital. 

3. Directing a preventive c Jfort to individuals 
who have already demonstrated suicidal 
behavior avoids concerns that the "idea" of 
suicide will be introduced to a naive lis- 
tener. 

A preferred intervention with the suicidal in- 
dividual has long been the crisis center. The 
rationale for suicide crisis care has been ar- 
ticulated by Schneidman and Farberow 
(1957) viz; 

1. suicidal behavior is often associated with a 
crisis; 

2. suicide is contemplated with psychological 
ambivalence-wishes to die exist simul- 
taneously with wishes to be rescued and 
saved; 

3. humans have a basic need to express them-

selves and to communicate with others; 

4. the suicidal individual's ambivalence about 
dying stems from a psychiatric illness in 
which the suicide represents a partially un- 
satisfactory means of achieving "fantas ies 
of.. ..surcease, revenge, atonement, 
ecstasy, rowue and rebirth..." This con- 
fusion leads to an oblique communication 
or signal or "cry for help" which is best iden- 
tified by those with special training (Lit- 
man et al., 1965). 

In practice, telephone crisis services offer 
several advantages. They are convenient and 
accessible and . thus offer an individual in 
crisis the opportunity for discussion and sup- 
port without having to travel or wait for an 
appointment. Their anonymity may be reas- 
suring and may allow callers to say shocking 
or embarrassing things which they could not 
otherwise do in a face-to-face interview. 

The first crisis center, "The Antisuicide 
Bureau," was started in 1906 in London by 
the Salvation Army. In the same year, the 
National Save a Life League was established 
in New York City. Shortly after World War 
II, the Neuropsychiatric Institute in Vienna 
established a counseling center run by volun- 
teers. Six years later in London, the 
Samaritans was started by the Reverend 
Chad Varah (Varah, 1973 and Fox, 1976). 
Twenty-two years after its establishment, the 
Samaritans had 165 branches in Great 
Britain alone and received over 1 million calls 
a year. It is staffed by volunteer "listeners" 
and insists on strict confidentiality. Its inter- 
actions, characterized as acts of "befriend- 
ing", are predominantly non-directive. 

The influential Los Angeles Suicide Preven- 
tion Center (LASPC) was established in 
1958, initially concerned with evaluation and 
rehabilitation of hospitalized survivors of 
suicide attempts (Litman et al., 1961). In 
1961, it broadened its activities to include 
community outreach, and a short while later, 
a 24-hour telephone hotline, thus becoming 
the prototype of American crisis centers. It 
has regularly sponsored research projects, 
many of which are referred to in this review.

Its early goals and operations have been 
described by Helig et al. (1968) and Litman 
etal. (1971). 

There was a rapid proliferation of crisis ser- 
vices modeller) on this program during the 
late 1960's and the early 1970's. By 1974, 
nearly all metropolitan areas in the United 
States had such a cente! and many had two 
or more (Miller et al., 1979). 

Deferences and Similarities Between Crisis 
Centers 

Telephone crisis services have certain 
characteristics in common; they have the 
capacity to offer immediate emotional sup- 
port; they are available outside of usual of- 
fice hours; they provide the opportunity for 
anonymity; they tend to be staffed by volun- 
teers; the assistance they offer is often 
problem rather than "diagnosis" specific and 
help is always ihort term. 

Within these similarities there exist differen- 
ces in emphasis. Some function 
predominantly as information or referral ser- 
vices, rapidly ascertain' ng the problem and 
then referring the caller to an appropriate 
treatment center. This service sometimes ex- 
tends to the volunteer making the appoint- 
ment and checking that it has been kept. 
Sometimes this type of case management is 
offered by multi-service agencies which link 
the caller with the most appropriate unit of 
the service. When appropriate, calls may be 
passed directly to a duty psychiatrist or social 
worker. At the extreme of the intervention 
spectrum, there are crisis services which 
primarily offers a psychological environment 
which the person in crisis may find supportive 
and which encourages callers to drop in (par- 
ticularly true of the Samaritans). 

Centers vary in the stress they place on con- 
fidentiality. The Samaritans generally offer 
total confidentiality (Hirsch, 1981), whereas, 
many services in the Uni .cd States are willing 
to intervene very actively (including sum- 
moning the police) in order to avert a suicide. 

The "befriending" process of the Samaritans 
has been likened to Rogerian psychotherapy 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



with its emphasis on acceptance and warmth. 
This is shared by many Centers in the United 
States. Ross (1980), a learf^r in the suicide 
prevention movement, states that the "most 
important objective in responding to suicidal 
youth is to opr n the lines of commumV^- 
tion...accomplisned by showing concern, in- 
terest and understanding in a 
non-judgmental manner". It has been sug- 
gested tha'. the anonymity centers provide 
may be especially helpful to callers who find 
a discussion of their problems embarrassing. 
Additionally, patients who are concerned 
with issues of control and power may be more 
comfortable with telephone counseling as 
they have the option of hanging up. 

Volunteers are usually, but not always, super- 
vised by social workers or other mental 
health professionals. These menial health 
professionals are also available tor consult- 
ation. This would generally not be the case 
with Samaritan services. 

A number of programs target a specific 
population such as college students (Ottens, 
1^-84) and at least one (Glatt et al., 1986) has 
a telephone situated on a bridge that is 
renowned as a place for fatal suicide leaps. 

The differences between centers are some- 
times subtle and are implicit rather than 
stated. This makes research difficult and re- 
quires that rather general operational 
criteria be adopted by researchers. For ex- 
ample. Bridge et al. (1977) designated any 
entity a suicide prevention center if: a) there 
was an identifiable person in the community 
responsible for the service; b) if it provided 
24-hour telephone or emergency service 
coverage; and, c) if it advertised its existence. 

Impact of Crisis Centers on Mortality 

A number of cross sectional studies have 
compared the rates in areas with and without 
crisis centers, or in areas before and after the 
introduction of a crisis center. 

Two early studies (Litman and Farberow, 
1969; Ringel, 1969) reported a drop in the 
suicide rate in Los Angeles and Vienna 
respectively, after a service was introduced at 



a time when the rates in California and in the 
rest of Austria were reported to be increas- 
ing. 

However, suicide rates vary with the 
demographic composition of a population. 
Rates are associated with sex, age and eth- 
nicity. The demographic profile of a given 
area, and hence its potential suicide rate, are 
all susceptible to change f.nd simple correla- 
tional studies of this kind are inadequate. 
Account of these factors must be taken and 
appropriate control areas need to be studied. 
It should be said here that m ith one exception 
(Bagley, see below), no methodologically 
adequate study has been able to demonstrate 
an impact of suicide prevention centers on 
the number of deaths from suicide. 

One of the first studies to use a control 
population, was carried out by Weiner (1969) 
to assess the impact of the LASPC. Com- 
parisons were made between the suicide rate 
during the C years prior to the introduction 
of the hotline services at the LASl'C and the 
6 years afterwards and between two major 
California metropKilitan areas that had ser- 
vices (Los Angeles and San Francisco) and 
two that did not (San Diego and San Bernar- 
dino county). However, changes in these 
rates were not corrected for demographic 
differences between the cities studied. The 
study noted that there was a significant in- 
crease in the suicide rate after the introduc- 
tion of the hotline service in Los Angeles, but 
this increase does not seem to have been sys- 
tematically related to the presence of suicide 
prevention centers, for there were similar in- 
creases in San Francisco which had a service 
and San Diego which did not, and a fall in San 
Bernardino county, which did not have a ser- 
vice. These fiuctuations in rate are common 
and cannot be interpreted without correc- 
tions for changing socio-demographic 
profiles. An additional confounding factor in 
this study was that the study period covered 
the development of a close collaboration be- 
tween the Center and the medical examiner 
and this may have resulted in a broader 
definition of suicide (Litman and Farberow, 
1969) and with it, an increase in coroner's

determinations. 

Lester (1 973), examined the suicide rate in a 
number of major metropolitan areas in the 
United States, comparing rates in cities 
before 1967 and after 1969. He compared 
cities where a suicide prevention center had 
been established with rates in cities where no 
center existed. An analysis of covariance was 
used to control for the size of the city. No 
differences were found, but the study did not 
control for changes in reporting procedure or 
for differences in demographic mj^ke-up. 
The sample of cities was small and the dura- 
tion of surveillance short, given the low in- 
cidence of suicide. 

In a methodologically rigorous study. Bridge 
and colleagues at Duke University (1977) 
compared the incidence of suicide in coun- 
ties with and without suicide prevention 
centers in all 100 counties of North Carolina. 
They used a multivariate approach to ac- 
count for a number of possibly confounding 
variables at the same time. These included 
duration of existence of a center, and a large 
number of socic-demographic variables. 
The mean duration of existence of a center 
was 2.8 years. No changes in reporting pro- 
cedures occurred during the time under 
study. The highest incidence of suicide was 
in communities characterized by a high 
proportion of older, white, married persons; 
suicide centers were more often located in 
areas with different demographic charac- 
teristics. Their results suggested that com- 
pared to the influence of demographic 
variables, suicide centers have a minimal ef- 
fect on rate. They also found only trivial in- 
teractions between the presence of a center 
and community characteristics such as age 
distribution, type of "cause of death" deter- 
mining system, and population density of an 
area, i.e., there was no evidence that hotlines 
were more effective in certain communities 
than in others. 

The B'-tish study by Bagley (1968) is the one 
that was most widely quoted as supporting 
the efficacy of suicide prevention centers. It 
was noted that suicide rates in that country 
were in decline and that the period of decline 



coincided with the growth of the Samaritan 
movement. In fact this was not accurate: the 
decline in British suicide rates (which was al- 
most certainly due to the introduction of 
nv?n-lethal domestic cooking gas to substitute 
for coal gas-see above) halted in 1971 al- 
though the number of Samaritan branches 
and clients continued to rise until 1975 
(Brown, 1979). In this study, Bai^ley used 
both empirical and a priori techniques to 
identify control communities. The empirical 
match was based on the two most important 
factors derived from p principal components 
analysis. The a priori match was for popula- 
tion over age 65, percentage of females, and 
social class index. (These factors accounted 
for 35 percent of the variance.) He com- 
pared cities with and without centers match- 
ing those with centers to control cities 
identified through the two methods. 

Bagley found that 15 Samaritan boroughs ex- 
perienced £ fall of 6 percent whereas control 
boroughs exp»'rienced a rise of 20 percent 
(empirical) or 7 percent (a priori). Research 
scientists from the Medical Research Coun- 
cil Suicide Research Unit attempted to repli- 
cate Bagley's findings (Barraclough et al., 
1977; Jennings et al., 1978). They employed 
methodological improvements including 
using a wider variety of matches, examining 
more geographical areas, ard using matches 
which accounted for more of the suicide rate 
variance. On the same target boroughs, they 
used 4 coordinates to do the empirical match- 
ing mstead of 2, thus accounting for 65 per- 
cent of the variance instead of Bagley's 43 
percent. Further, they broadened the search 
for matchable borou'jhs and used a different 
predictive rate match. To accomplish this, 
they choose boroughs with similar rates 
before the establishment of a Samaritan cen- 
ter and p.lso matched for proportion of single 
person households. Both of these methods 
accounted for significantly more of the 
variance than those adopted by Bagley. They 
examined suicide rates for 6 years prior to the 
establishment of a center and 6 years after its 
opening. It was not possible to replicate 
Bagley's findings; no difference was found 
between Samaritan and control towns. They

also noted that the rates of suicide decrease 
did not parallel the increase in Samaritan 
usage (Barraclough et al., 1977). Bagley 
(1977) responded to this critical exercise by 
stating that the difficulties in evaluating the 
impact of services were too great and that 
there was no reasonable way to demonstrate 
their efficacy. 

In the United States, Miller et al. (1984) 
elaborated on the effects of suicide preven- 
tion services on suicide rates. The period of 
study began in 1968, when most cities did 
NOT have suicide prevention centers and 
ran until 1973 when most cities did have such 
centers. During this 6-year period, they ex- 
amined the effects of suicide prevention ser- 
vices on age-, race-, and sex-specific 
populaticn groups. After going through a 
lengthy series of procedures to verify the date 
of a center's introduction, they compared 
suicide rates in 25 locations that had no cen- 
ter prior to 1979 but which then introduced 
and maintained one until at least 1973, with 
50 counties which experienced no change in 
the number of crisis centers during that time. 
Age-, race-, and sex-specific rates were ex- 
amined for all years for all centers. Dif- 
ference scores were calculated by covaiying 
on the base rate. It was reasoned that if crisis 
centers serve predominantly younger 
women, then, any impact of a service could 
be expected among that group. They found 
a small but significant reduction in suicide 
rate (1.75/100,000) in white females after the 
introduction of a service, but no evidence of 
an impact in other population groups. Their 
examination was repeated on a second set of 
data at a different time i)eriod and their find- 
ings were replicated. 

A variant to the crisis service provision 
method of studying this problem can be seen 
in the study by Chowdhury et al. (1973), who 
randomly assigned suicide attempt repeaters 
to routine out-patient care or to an enhanced 
service which also provided an emergency 
telephone service and a walk-in facility. The 
latter group received home visits if they failed 
to keep an appointment. The groups did not 
differ in reattempt rates nor on any measure 



of mental state at the end of a six month fol- 
lowup period. 

COMMENTS: The disappointing impact of 
crisis centers on suicide mortality needs to be 
explained. To explore this question further, 
we have further analyzed the literature on 
who uses and does not use centers, whether 
th^ are suicidal and whether any particular 
types of cases seem resistant to their impact. 

Who Uses Crisis Centers? 

Descriptions of adult callers (Sawyer, 1972; 
Murphy et al., 1969) and teenage counseling 
services (King, 1977; Slem and Cotler, 1973; 
Morgan and King, 1975) indicate that U.S. 
suicide prevention centers are predominant- 
ly used by females. A disproportionate num- 
ber are under age 30 and they show the same 
ethnic distribution of the area in which the 
center is based. They do not, therefore, 
reflect the special demographics of suicide 
completion in which males predominate and 
blacks are underrepresented. 

It also seems that many, non-suicidal in- 
dividuals in crisis use these seivices. Tbey 
may be lonely, isolated people. This is not in 
itself incompatible with the goals of a suicide 
service unless it diverts resources from 
suicidal callers. 

Hirsch (1981) monitored 100 calls each at the 
LASPC and at the London branch of the 
Samaritans. About 40 percent of the Los An- 
geles center's calls did not concern suicide. 
The incidence of non-suicide related calls is 
higher in Europe. In Helsinki, Aalberg 
(1971) found that only 25 percent of calls 
concerned suicidal ideation or suicidality. 
The same proportion of suicidal calls was 
found among callers to the Samaritans 
(Hirsch, 1981). A considerable proportion 
of non-suicidal calls to the Samaritans were 
characterized as "sex" calls. 

Studies of Teenagers

pact of hotline or crisis services on teenagers. 
This section will identify teenage usage rates

findings of the single evaluation study of a 
hotline service designed specifically for 
teenagers. 

In an early report of 1,607 consecutive 
telephone callers to the LASPC (Litman et 
al., 1965), 5 percent of the callers were under 
age 20. Greer and Anderson (1979) inter- 
viewed 90 percent of 364 consecutive cases 
of attempted suicide in a busy hospital in 
South London of whom 19 percent were 
under age 19. More than 70 percent of the 
total group had knowledge of the 
Samaritans, but that proportion was far 
smaller among teenagers. King (1977) sur- 
veyed 3,000 college students who had passed 
their freshman year and reported that 3 per- 
cent had called a service, two-thirds of these 
were for personal counseling rather than to 
report disturbing behavior in others. This 3 
percent utilization rate compared favorably 
with the proportion of students who used the 
student mental health service. Only 8 per- 
cent of the surveyed callers were currently in 
some form of therapy, indicating that the hot- 
line was reaching a population not served by 
other community agencies. 

Slem and Cotler (1973) studied the impact of 
a hotline service for teenagers (not specifi- 
cally oriei.ted towards suicide prevention) in 
an upper middle class community in subur- 
ban Detroit. The service had been intro- 
duced through advertising in newspapers and 
on school and community bulletin boards, 
and widely distributed business cards. At an 
unspecified later time, 1763 students in a 
local high school were surveyed to find out 
whether they knew of, or had used, the ser- 
vice. The answers indicated that the hotline 
was acknowledged as a community service of 
which they were aware with the same fre- 
quency as the YMCA and high school coun- 
selling services. 98 percent recognized the 
name of the service from a list of community 
services and 5.6 percent had used it. When 
asked to rank preferred sources of help for 
problems, users ranked the service higher 
than non-users. Both groups listed friends as 
being the most important source of help. Not 
very much information was available about 



the users except that approximately two- 
thirds were female and that users ranked help 
from parents as being potentially less valu- 
able than non-users, perhaps indicating a less 
satisfactory home background. There was a 
relatively low response rate among former 
hotline users about whether they had found 
the service useful, but two-thirds of the 
responders confirmed that their contact had 
been useful. 

These studies, while indicating that a hotline 
service can obtain satisfactory community 
recognition, are inadequate for our purpose 
because neither specify the proportion of 
calls that pertained to suicide and neither ex- 
amined the impact on psychiatric morbidity 
generally, or suicide morbidity specifically. 

Studies of Adults 

—Suicide and Crisis Service Users; What 
Proportion of Callers Are Suicidal? 

Litman et al. (1965), in an early report from 
the LASPC, noted the following: 45 percent 
of the callers were either currently receiving 
or had previously received psychiatric treat- 
ment. 50 percent talked about suicide during 
their call; 40 percent had made a previous 
suicide attempt of which 22 percent were 
within the preceding week. Only 10 percent 
of calls were unrelated to "suicide poten- 
tiality" (a rather loosely defined concept). 
Usage patterns may have changed because 
Hirsch (1981) in a survey of 100 calls at the 
LASPC noted that 40 were not related to 
suicide. 

Evidence for the suicide potential of hotline 
users has been gathered from studies which 
have looked at the subsequent suicide rates 
in callers. In interpreting studies of this kind 
it should be remembered that several factors 
tend to lead to an underestimate of later 
suicides among users. These include: 

a. Many studies match callers' names with 
death certificate data collected from the 
same administrative area (e.g. county) as 
the service, and will miss people who have 
died in other locations. 



3-47 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



b. A sizable proportion of calls are made 
anonymously and cannot be linked to 
death certificates or clinic records. There 
is some evidence (Tabachnik and Klug- 
man, 1965; Nelson et al., 1975) that 
anonymous callers are more likely to be 
living on their own, which would place 
them in an especially high risk group. 

It is also important to note that subsequent 
suicides among crisis center callers cannot be 
used to infer information about the efficacy 
of a center because no comparison can be 
made with the suicidal individuals who do not 
call the center. Given those caveats, the 
studies that are available tend to confirm that 
crisis center users are deviant and carry a 
much higher risk of later suicide than a nor- 
mal control population. 

In uncontrolled, followup studies of a ran- 
dom sample of LASCP callers, Litman 
(1970) and Wold and Litman, (1973) noted 
that between 1 percent and 2 percent of 
callers had committed suicide within 2 years 
of their initial contact. 

Sawyer et al. (1972) reported a study which 
drew comparisons with the rate in the same 
geographic area but which did not correct for 
age and sex. They found that 0.6 percent of 
the approximately 11,000 callers to the 
Cleveland Suicide Prevention Center had 
committed suicide within 4 years of their call. 
This figure represents a rate of 288/100,000 
or approximately 25 times the expected 
death rate (uncorrected for age and sex). 
Three-quarters of the suicides had been 
referred to the center by others, compared 
with one-quarter of the group overall. The 
median interval between time of contact and 
• suicide was months. Only 6 percent of all 
suicides in the city of Cleveland had been in 
touch with the Suicide Prevention Center at 
some time before death. In the absence of 
age- and sex-matched controls, these rates 
are difficult to interpret but appear some- 
what lower than the 2.5 percent to 5 percent 
suicide rate noted by Greer and Lee (1967) 
in their 2.5 year followup of serious suicide 
attempters treated in genera] hospitals. The 
lower death rate found in such crude com- 



parisons cannot be used to infer the efficacy 
of the prevention centers; it may simply 
reflect different demographic composition of 
callers to different centers. 

Barraclough and Shea (1970) found death 
(suicide and other causes) rates, corrected 
for age, sex, location of call, and death, of in- 
dividuals who had called the Samaritans in six 
British counties to be 32 times the expected 
rate during the first year after the call. This 
rate fell to 7 times the expected rate 3 years 
after the call. 30 percent of the deaths oc- 
curred within the first month, 71 percent 
within a year and 90 percent within 2 years 
after the call. The death rates were inter- 
mediate between that of former mental 
hospital patients and currently depressed 
patients, but were considerably less than 
those among former psychiatric in-patients 
who had been admitted following a previous 
suicide attempt (Temoche et al., 1964). 
There were marked differences between dif- 
ferent centers, some having a lower than ex- 
pected death rate, others a lower initial (first 
year) rate, but a comparable or higher second 
year rate (suggesting that suicide had been 
deferred). These differences could have 
reflected the quality of interventions or a dif- 
ferent clinical base. 

COMMENTS: Suicide crisis centers attract 
potentially suicidal individuals. 

—Who Will Go On To Suicide? 

Several studies (Ovenstone and Kreitman, 
1974; Wold and Litman, 1973; Wilkins, 1970; 
McKenna et al., 1975) have found that 
suicidal patients who make use of crisis 
telephone services fall into two groups: a 
chronically suicidal group and an acutely 
stressed group without a history of piior at- 
tempts. Litman et al. (1965) predicted that 
crisis centers would be most helpful to the 
suicidal individual who is isolated and friend- 
less or one who has su ffered the loss of an im- 
portant person through death or rejection. 
Crisis centers were predicted t( be least help- 
ful to suicidal individuals with chronically dis- 
organized behavior, or long standing 
dysphrric or psychotic states.

D.Shaffer: A Critical Review of Preventive Intervention.. 



This is, in fact, what was found by Wold and 
Litman (1973) in their detailed foUowup of a 
random 1 out of 10 sample of suicide preven- 
tion center callers. Among those who sub- 
sequently committed suicide, most had a 
chronic h istoiy of psychiatric disturbance and 
several previous episodes of suicidal be- 
havior. The crises which had led to their 
original call were different from those which 
ultimately preceded their death. They had 
gone on to experience, and in all likelihood, 
generate, additional crises. 

These findings were supported by Wilkins 
(1970) in a death certificate match of ap- 
proximately 1,300 callers. Suicides were 
more likely than non-suiciders to be unmar- 
ried, to have made a previous attempt, and to 
have received previous psychiatric treat- 
ment. 

COMMENTS: There is evidence that 
chronically disturbed callers who have made 
previous attempts and had previous 
psychiatric treatment are an especially high- 
risk group for later suicide and that crisis 
management is inappropriate for them. 

—How Suicidal Users Compare To 
Suicidal Non-Users 

Differences between attempters who have 
used hotlines previously and those who have 
not, have been reported in several studies. 

Barraclough and Shea (1970) found that 4 
percent of a consecutive series of adult 
suicides had used the Samaritans. Wold 
(1970) compared the characteristics of 
26,000 LASPC contacters with a group of 42 
suicides and noted that 75 percent of the cen- 
ter contacters were women, compared with 
36 percent of the completers. Center contac- 
ters were, on the average, 9 years younger 
than comphters. A disproportionate num- 
ber of center contacters were less than age 
30. 

Motto (1971), who studied 575 individuals 
consecutively admitted to a psychiatric in- 
patient unit for treatment of either a depres- 
sive or a suicidal state, found that 11 percent 
had used suicide prevention centers. More 



than SO peicent of these felt that they had 
been helped by the contact, 10 percent said 
they had been made worse. The most com- 
monly stated reason for not calling was that 
they had been unaware of the centers' exist- 
ence. Greer and Anderson (1979) inter- 
viewed 90 percent of 364 consecutive cases 
of attempted suicide in a busy hospital in 
South London, 19 percent of whom were 
under age 19. Approximately 14 percent of 
these attempters had had some contact with 
the Samaritans in the past, but very few had 
done so just prior to their recent suicide at- 
tempt. Overall, just over 70 percent of the 
group had knowledge of the Samaritans; that 
proportion was far smaller among teenagers. 
Among those of all ages who knew of the 
crisis service, the most commonly stated 
reasons for not calling were: 

a. it did not occur to the caller, 

b. they wanted relief from their distress or 
wanted to die, 

c. they thought thai the crisis center would be 
unable to help. 

Half of the group that felt that the 
Samaritans could not help had prior con- 
tact with the Samaritans. 

Greer and Weinstein (1979) studied suicidal 
patients vho were receiving mental health 
treatment, comparing those who had first 
contacted a hotline with those who were 
identified by a mobile emergency team which 
made outreach endeavors to families or in- 
dividuals in crisis. Hotline patients had a 
lower suicide potential score on certain 
standard measures and were less likely to re- 
quire admission after being seen. The fmd- 
ings from this study may tell us as much about 
the seriousness of cases identified by a mobile 
team as they do about the mildness of disor- 
ders seen in patients who call hotlines. 

COMMENTS: In general, this is a sparse 
literature but an important one. There is a 
lot of evidence that hotlines do not have im- 
pact on a community's suicide rates (sec 
below). It is clear that their utilization rate 
by suicide attempters is low (the highest rale

in the studies cited being 14%) and although 
in Greer and Anderson's study there were a 
proportion of attempters who reported 
having been disappointed at the intervention 
they had receiveid previously, most of those 
who did not call did not think about it or did 
not know of the hotline's existence. Lack of 
knowledge is a special problem with 
teenagers.

A number of studies document the low rate 
of compliance with care after emergency 
room triage interventions have been 
provided to suicide attempters or to hotline 
callers. Only one study has been carried out 
with adolescents. Litt et al. (1983) studied 27 
adolescents seen in an emergency room. All 
were offered further appointments but only 
33 percent kept them. Failure to keep an ap- 
pointment was similar in groups referred 
from an emergency room or from an in- 
patient ward, but was more common in those 
who had made a previous attempt. The num- 
bers in this study were too small to permit 
adequate statistical analysis to which a variety 
of interrelated factors might have con- 
tributed. Additionally, there was no ade- 
quate examination of the clinicians' 
technique which has been shown to be im- 
portant in studies among adult attempters. 

A similar low "show" rate has been reported 
for adults. Chameides et al. (1973) found a 
compliance rate of 35 percent, and Paykel et 
al. (197^> reported a compliance rate of 44 
percent with out-patient referrals made in 
the emergency room. Compilers with the 
out-patient referral did not differ from non- 
compliers with respect to clinical characteris- 
tics. Furthermore, many of those who do 
keep their first, or first few, assigned appoint- 
ments will fail to maintain contact with the 
center to which they are referred, and will 
drop out of their treatment program prema- 
turely (Kogan, 1957b; Jacobsen et al., 1965). 

Factors contributing to referral failure have 
been studied by Knesper (1982) in nearly 300 




3-50 



emergen^ room cases managed by 15 dif- 
ferent clinicians. Failure was found to be in- 
dependent of patient characteristics, at least 
so far as suicide intentionality was concerned, 
but an "outlier analysis" showed significant 
clinician variation. The fact that some 
clinicians can persuade most of their patients 
to attend a later appointment while others 
can persuade very few, suggests that clinician 
behavior is important. The fact that referral 
failure is not an ind^ of seriousness of disor- 
der was found specifically by Paykel et al. 
(1974) who noted that attempters who com- 
plied with their referral and attempters who 
did not comply with a referral did not differ 
in clinical characteristics including the 
seriousness of their attempt. Chameides and 
Yamamoto (1973) found that many of those 
who fail to comply will see some other men- 
tal health professional during the year after 
their attempt 

The same appears to hold true for other 
referral situations. In a study of the failure 
of hotline callers to comply with suggested 
appointments, Lester (1970) found that the 
percentage of shows after a telephone call to 
a crisis service ranged from 29 to 56 percent 
with some seasonal variation and con- 
siderable variation with individual volun- 
teers. Approximately half o'l the 20 different 
personnel involved had a success rate of less 
than 40 percent, whereas the other half had 
a success rate of between 50 percent and 80 
percent 

What contributes to clinician/volunteer 
failure? Knesper (1982) noted that a 
clinician who would spring the question of 
admission on a patient suddenly and without 
warning at the end of an examination had a 
very low rate of success in making referrals tc 
an in-patient unit. 

Slaiku et al. (1975) found no significant cor- 
relations between compliance and the 
hotline volunteer's conversational charac- 
teristics in particular, whether they made 
specific reference to words like suicide or in- 
stead used euphemisms in referring to such 
matters. They noted a higher show rate when 
attendance for an appointment was initiated

by the caller. 

Several studies suggest that compliance can 
be improved if the volunteer or clinician 
makes an actual appointment for the 
patient/caller rather than simply providing 
them with a name and number to call. Kogan 
(1975a) recorded a 37 percent compliance 
rate for attempters seen in an emergency 
room when the patient was provided a name 
and telephone number compared with 82 
percent when an appointment was made 
during triage. 

Rogawski and Edmundson (1971), using a 
more stringent index of compliance (2 kept 
appointments), found that only 30 percent of 
those given a name and telephone number 
kept their appointment, but that 55 percent 
did so when an appointment was made for 
them. However, neither were random as- 
signment studies and there may have been 
other selection factors which contributed to 
being chosen for the more active interven- 
tion and to later compliance. 

There is also some evidence that compliance 
may be improved if referral is made to a 
specific clinical service rather than to a local 
generic service. Welu (1977) contrasted 
compliance to a specific, new outreach 
program with 57 cases seen before the estab- 
lishment of the new program who had been 
referred to their community mental health 
service. He found that 90 percent of the 
cases attended the new program compared 
with only 54 percent of the cases referred to 
the original program. No details are given 
about whether elements other than the 
novelty of the program played any part in at- 
taining this unusually high compliance rate. 
Those who attended the novel program 
made significatitly fewer attempts. 

Sudak et al. (1977) reported compliance 
rates at the Qeveland Suicide Prevention 
Center. Approximately two-thirds of the 
referrals to this center are females. A center 
professional routinely makes an appoint- 
ment for the individual who has been triaged 
and will then followup to see if the appoint- 
ment has been kept. The overall compliance 



rate was 60 percent with higher rates being 
reported for patients who were already in 
treatment with another therapist. Similar 
rates were reported for those who had made 
a recent suicide attempt as for those who 
called for other reasons. 

COMMENTS: Low compliance with 
recommendations is clearly a pervasive 
problem and should be monitored routinely 
by any crisis service. Some variation with hel- 
pers will occur, but evidence is sufficient that 
active procedures result in a significantly im- 
proved compliance; they should become 
standard and expected. 

Conveying Inappropriate Information 

Bleach and Claibora (1974) and Apsler and 
Hodas (1975) simulated real callers and 
found that about 15 of 96 volunteer- 
answered calls generated inappropriate in- 
formation from the volunteer. Volunteers 
tended to give callers a range of referral sites 
without doing any editing or attempting to 
find a best fit for the callers' problems. 

InterferenceWUhOtherTreatments 

It has been argued that the existence of readi- 
ly accessible crisis services could complicate 
other therapeutic interventions. Certainly 
many callers are receiving treatment else- 
where. King (1977), in a study of college stu- 
dent crisis service users, found that 8 percent 
of callers, were currently in some form of 
therapy. Litman et aL (1965) noted that 
about 20 percent of 1,607 consecutive callers 
to the I ASPC were currently in some form 
of therapy. Hirsch (1981) noted that many of 
the calls to the LASPC dealt with complaints 
about therapists. 

COMMENTS: The undermining of other 
effective forms of treatment is likely to be a 
problem if a center has a strong theoretical 
bias, but there is no evidence of a negative 
impact through this mechanism. 

Popularity With Users 

Slem and Cotler (1973) in their assessment 
of high school users, reported that 68 percent 
had had a good experience with crisis ser- 



3-51 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



vices. The findings of this study must be in- 
terpreted cautiously because the followup 
rate was relatively low (58%) and the num- 
ber of suicidal users was not specified. 

King's (1977) study of college student users 
indicated that the majority of girls found the 
counseling services helpfiil, but fewer than 
half of the male students did so. The dif- 
ference between the sexes was statistically 
significant. However, between 20 and 33 
percent of males and between 10 and 20 per- 
cent of females reported that the experience 
of hotline usage made their problem worse. 
Satisfaction among users who called because 
of suicidal ideation or attempt was marke<'.ly 
less for males than it was for females. 
Females who received counseling fro.n a 
male listener on the whole reported greater 
satisfaction with the help received. Similar- 
ly, males who received help from a female lis- 
tener reported more satisfaction than males 
who spoke to male listeners. 

Getz et al. (1975) found that patients with 
like problems, e.g., problems with their 
parents, felt more positively about the crisis 
intervention than callers who had serious 
mental illness or drug problems. 

COMMENTS: It is difficult to know 
whether the reports listed above are 
parochial, i.e. apply only to the center which 
has been studied, or have a more general ap- 
plication. Judging from the number of 
repeat calls reported by most centers, there 
must be a reasonable level of satisfaction, but 
this may not in itself be related to efficacy. 

Volunteers vs. Professionals; The Impact of 
Training 

Bleach and Claibom (1974) and Genthner 
(1974) used students to simulate clients and 
rated empathy of volunteers working in crisis 
centers. Using standardized rating scales, 
both found that most volunteers were 
functioning at low levels of warmth and em- 
pathy. 

Hirsch (1981), in an essentially anecdotal 
comparison of volunteers and professionals, 
suggests that volunteers show more warmth, 




3-52 



empathy and patience but are less skilled 
than professionals in eliciting relevant past 
history and in being able to integrate infor- 
mation from the volunteer. This has been at 
least partly confirmed by comparisons be- 
tween trained and untrained volunteers. 
Knickerbocker and McGee, (1973) found 
greater warmth and empathy in untrained 
volunteers. It was not clear, however, 
whether the more experienced volunteers 
had received specific training in empathy and 
warmth and where this has been the case- 
training in empathetic response-improve- 
ments appear to occur over time (France, 
1975; Kalafat et al., 1979). Differences in 
trained and untrained workers in these skills 
may be moot because the literature on 
psychotherapy outcome shows only poor 
agreement betvs'een therapist characteristics 
and good outcome (see Stein and Lambert 
tor details). 

Another relevant dimension is that of per- 
missive vs. directive. Knowles (1979) and 
Mcarthy and Berman (1979) noted a tenden 
cy for untrained volunteers to be very dl" , j- 
tive and to offer advice, often prematurely 
and on the basis of inadequate information. 

Ottens (1984) developed a prcgiram initially 
used to train key faculty, residence hall coor- 
dinators, and other staff at Cornell Univer- 
sity. The program focuses on how to take a 
proactive, and directive approach to crisis 
management, familiarity with available 
resources and how to use the resources, and 
how to interact with the crisis victim. The 
program was evaluated by designing a set of 
situational vignettes with multiple choice 
answers designed to depict possible inter- 
venor actions. The validation criteria were 
established by obtaining responses on the 
same questions from Crisis Center staff. Al- 
though it is stated that there were changes in 
the rank ordering of several of the different 
items, data are not provided. Statistical 
values are not given nor are the statistical 
procedures described. 

Elkins and Cohen (1982) found little im- 
provement in hotline volunteers after 5 
months of training, but those who received

pre-job training did appreciably better than 
others. The less dogmatic, the more sensitive 
and skilled the person was likely to be. 

The relationship between knowledge of 
suicide lethality and ability to deal with 
suicidal individuals was examined in a group 
of nursing students by Inman et al. (1984). 
There seemed to be little relationship be- 
tween the lethality knowledge and skill re- 
quired for effective management of suicidal 
patients. 

CXJMMENTS: Suicide crisis services are 
used by seriously ill individuals who have a 
high suicide potential. Despite their high 
usage rates and the high proportion of calls 
which pertain to suicide, an overwhelming 
majority of attempters do not call thesfe'ser- 
vices. The literature does not allow us to 
conclude whether their failure to effect 
death rates-except marginally on young 
white women~(See Miller, 1984) is due to 
the failure of their technique to meet the 
needs of a residual suicidal population or to 
their failure to attract an appropriate popula- 
tion. On the one hand, information on the 
nature of callers who suicide suggests a mis- 
match of technique with recurrent suicide at- 
tempters. Data from studies which 
compared users and non-users suggest low 
utilization rates. However the evidence is 
drawn from a variety of studies of different 
populations at different times in different 
countries. The issue remains an important 
one and should, perhaps, be a specific focus 
for further research. 

It is important to determine whether the 
findings relating suicide repetitions can be 
applied to adolescents. Despite their youth, 
teenagers frequently have a history of 
repeated attempts and attempt repetition 
has been found in at least one study to be a 
predictor of later suicide (Otto et al., 1972). 

It seems that a fruitful exercise for the future 
would be to investigate how best to increase 
and sustain knowledge about the availability 
of a hotline service to a vulnerable popula- 
tion group. This can be done (see Slem and 
Cotler's work demonstrating a high rate of 



recognition in their suburban community). It 
may also be true that the skills of telephone 
answerers in a crisis service decay when the 
service is used predominantly by non-suicidal 
callers. Research is needed to see whether 
more narrowly demarcating the caller 
population improves the quality of advice or 
information that volunteers give. 

Finally, there is evidence that hotline volun- 
teers may have defective mastery of informa- 
tion, may be deficient in empathy and may 
use inappropriate techniques to ensure com- 
pliance with referral recommendations. 
Research indicates that, although experience 
does not ameliorate these problems, training 
may. Clearly, regular evaluation of these ele- 
ments of a crisis intervention service, using 
techniques that have already been 
developed, should be a routine for estab- 
lished centers. 

After the Crisis 

There have been no satisfactory studies in 
which suicidal teenagers have been random- 
ly assigned to differing systematic treatments 
with outcomes observed in a controlled 
fashion. (See Trautman and Shaffer, 1984) 
The bulk of this section, therefore, relates to 
studies of adults. 

Clearly, the expected efficacy of any 
psychiatric intervention is dependent on its 
success in attracting disturbed patients, on 
their compliance with treatment being 
recommended and on the effectiveness of 
the treatment recommended. The literature 
contains relatively few adequately designed 
studies for this purpose. Most are quasi- 
naturalistic studies in which individuals who 
comply with treatment recommendations are 
compared with those who do not, or in which 
outcome for those who were treated routine- 
ly before a new program was instituted are 
compared with those who enter a new 
program. Such studies present considerable 
problems in interpretation. There is no con- 
trol over the type of treatment that is offered. 
It will vary in type and quality with different 
practitioners. Non-compliers are a poor con- 
trol group because they may be either more

(i.e., don't adhere to schedules, etc.) or less 
(Le., not severely disturbed so don't see the 
need to attend) deviant than compilers. Dif- 
ferences between compilers and non-com- 
pliers may either negate or enhance the 
apparent effects of treatment. Before and 
after studies may also present difficulties be- 
cause the opening of a new service will tend 
to attract a different category of patients than 
those served before the ^tence of a new 
program. 

Naturalistic Studies 

Greer and Bagley (1971) contrasted suicide 
attempters who, due to staff oversight, had 
been discharged from an emergency room 
without a further appointment, and those 
who were given and complied with an ap- 
pointment to attend a psychiatric clinic. 
Non-referred cases had significantly higher 
suicide treatment rates than those who were 
seen by a psychiatrist. There were inter- 
mediate findings when those who had had 
more than 2 treatment visits were compared 
with those who had made only one visit. The 
seriousness of the initial attempt did not 
predict reattempt 

These findings have not been replicated and 
it is not clear whether the non-attenders were 
denied additional appointments or whether 
they also included some cases who were given 
a telephone number to call and who failed to 
do so and were thus classified as non-com- 
pliers. If the untreated control group did in- 
clude cases of this sort then the poor results 
might reflect some selection factor which was 
predictive of both non-compliance and 
repetition. On the other hand, if they were 
all systematically excluded, then the fmdings 
would suggest an effect. Other things being 
equal, oversight would more likely occur with 
less seriously disturbed patients. 

Ettlinger (1975), in Denmark, instituted a 
new service for suicide attempters which en- 
couraged unfettered access to mental health 
professionals, daytime hotline and walk-in 
clinics, frequent home visits made at the 
patients request, close consultation with 
other hospitals to which the patient might be 



admitted, and proactive outreach for a one- 
year period. The subsequent five/six year 
suicide rate for 670 consecutive admissions 
was examined and compared with the death 
rate for 681 attempters who had been ad- 
mitted to the hospital before the service had 
been started. The new service appears to 
have been popular and was used freely. 
Despite this, no differences were found in 
subsequent suicide rates or social adjustment 
between the two groups. The study is some- 
what flawed by the low retrieval rate for the 
control group but that would not have been 
expected to effect knowledge about later 
suicides. 

Welu (1977) contrasted suicide repetitions 
among 63 patients seen in an innovative out- 
reach program with 57 cases seen before the 
new program was introduced and who had 
been referred to a local community mental 
health center. Cases assigned to the new 
program were more likely to attend and made 
significantly fewer attempts during the 4- 
month foUowup period. 

Kennedy (1972) reports differences in 
repetition rates of 204 suicide attempters: 
142 were selected for short-term admission 
to a suicide crisis unit, 672 were referred to a 
psychiatrist for out-patient after care, and 56 
received no after-care. Repetition rates 
were significaniiy lower for those who were 
admitted for a short-term stay, but there were 
no differences in reattempt rates between 
the group that received long-term psychiatric 
treatment (which was often started several 
weeks after the attempt) and those who 
received no treatment. These flndings per- 
sisted even after corrections were made to 
account for previous suicide attempts, a fac- 
tor which is thought to be a strong predictor 
of further repetition. The authors inferred 
from these fmdings that crisis management is 
important 

Random Assignment Studies 

Chowdhury and Kreitman (1973) randomly 
assigned repeat attempters to routine out- 
patient care or an enhanced service which in- 
cluded emergency telephone access and a 



er|c 



D.Shaffer: A Critical Review of Preventive Intervention.. 



walk-in facility. Patients also received home 
visits if they failed to keep an appointment. 
Hie groups did not differ in their reattempt 
rates or on any measure of mental state. 
However, the experimental group ex- 
perienced fewer social problems (housing 
difficulties, unemployment, collection of 
benefits, etc.) at the end of the evaluation 
period than the controls. One cannot argue 
from this study that psychiatric care was not 
helpful as it was received by both groups. 

Motto (1976) and Motto et al. (1981) iden- 
tified a sample of 3005 hospitalized patients 
at "high risk" for suicide. All were offered 
after care. Of these, 862 declined. These 
were then randomly assigned to a group 
which received intermittent telephone con- 
tact at decreasing intervals over a S-year 
period, or to a group which received no fur- 
ther contact. During the first 2 years, suicide 
rates were twice as common in the non-con- 
tacted group as in those who received con- 
tact. During the remainder of the followup 
period the rates converged. This study is dif- 
ficult to interpret because of the way that 
non-compliance with treatment is handled. 
There was a relatively poor followup rate 
among those selected to receive contact 
(243/417 contact subjects either refused to 
receive contact or else could not be con- 
tacted). It would have been interesting to 
know what their death rate was, but in the 
study descriptions which have thus far ap- 
peared in print, they are not differentiated 
from the remainder of the contact group. 

Gibbons (1978) and Gibbons et al. (1980) 
randomly assigned 200 cases each to a course 
of intensive, but time-limited (3 months), 
task-centered case work, and to routine 
treatment (some cases were followed up by a 
psychiatrist, others by a general practitioner, 
etc.). Cases with high suicide intent were 
precluded from the random assignment and 
were all designated to receive the intensive 
approach. No differences were found be- 
tween the two experimental groups but the 
high risk "excluded" group had a significantly 
higher repetition rate. There were a sig- 
nificant number of drop outs from the treat- 



ment groups and the report does not specify 
the repetition rates for the partially treated 
groups. 

Only one random assignment study has been 
identified which assigned patients to dif- 
ferent types of psychological treatment. 
Liberman and Eckman (1981) randomly as- 
signed a small group of attempters to either 
32 hours of behavior therapy (social skills 
training, anxiety management, and contin- 
gency contracting) or to insight-oriented 
psychotherapy. The groups did not differ 
with respect to repetition of suicide attempts 
but the behavior therapy groups were 
generally less symptomatic and less preoc- 
cupied with suicidal ideation and threats. 

COMMENTS: Although none of the 
studies are adequate methodologically, none 
present clear and consistent evidence that 
suicide repetitions can be prevented by 
whatever array of interventions may have 
been offered in these different settings. The 
very high relapse rate of patients with a his- 
tory of chronic personality disturbance and 
previous suicide attempts in Chowdhury and 
Kreitman's study, even though they were 
provided with optimal and varied manage- 
ment, is particularly relevant in the light of 
Litman's observations that this is the group 
of crisis service contacters who are most 
prone to ultimately commit suicide. The ab- 
sence of psychopharmacological studies is 
especially striking and highlights a research 
priority area. 

CONCLUSIONS 

The prediction of rare events from common 
ones is a dispiriting process which has been 
commented on by several reviewers (Rosen, 
1954). Prcxlictions are plagued with low 
specificity (high false positive rates) which 
might be acceptable if the interventions were 
either inexpensive or efficacious or both. 
That is far from the case, however, in suicide. 
The general wisdom is that preventive inter- 
ventions should focus on suicide attempters 
or on depressed patients. 

With respect lo the latter, Temoche et al. 



(]{) 



3-55 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



(1964) undertook a rather dispiriting analysis 
of what the impact might be of an optimally 
efficient prevention scheme focusing on 
patients with a serious psychiatric illness 
which had required hospitalization. Using 
Massachusetts data, they matched 
psychiatric hospitalization records with 
suicidal death notifications. Suicide rates 
were low during the patients stay in hospital, 
but were veiy high in comparison with the 
general population after their discharge. 
Most deaths occurred during the first year 
after discharge and the group with the 
highest suicide rates were those that had 
received an in-patient diagnosis of depres- 
sive psychosis. Assuming that optimal 
protection (which might involve proLnged 
institutional care) was provided for the 
highest risk group for the period of maximum 
risk (one year after discharge) the (very ex- 
pensive) intervention would only reduce the 
suicide rate by 4 percent. They conclude that 
any more effective program would have to 
broaden the net of patients taken into care 
(thus radically increasing the cost), or would 
have to improve the efficiency of any predic- 
tors so that a smaller but more specific high 
risk group could be identified. This exercise 
did not take account of the very low com- 
pliance rate for treatment in this group of 
patients. 

Prevention based on the effective treatment 
of suicide attempters has not been subject to 
the same analysis, but given the lower ratio 
of attempts to completions we would expect 
that it would be more cost-effective than the 
management of depression if we could iden- 
tify an eifective intervention. While the 
literature which deals predominantly with 
psycho-social interventions fails to provide 
us with any indication that these interven- 
tions are effective, we cannot conclude from 
this that suicide attempts are untreatable. 
The literature, at least as we have surveyed 
it, is strikingly deficient in the area of 
psychopharmacology which, given its efficacy 
in the general area of affective illness, is sure* 
ly the area where most hope should be 
directed and which is most deserving of re- 
search support. 



ERiC 3-56 



Recent work on biological predictors of 
suicide repetition and completion (Asberg et 
al., 1976; Stanley, 1984) has not been dis- 
cussed in this review but it offers the prospect 
of increasing the specificity and thus reduc- 
ing the cost of preventive interventions. 

A considerable amount of energy and good- 
will, human sensitivity, and kindness has gone 
into the conventional suicide prevention ac- 
tivities but there is little evidence that they 
have been effective. Can we accept the bit- 
ter logic of research or should the findings be 
qualified with the customary apology that not 
all benefits can be researched? Certainly 
there is room for more research on the 
benefits of hotline calls and crisis centers for 
problems other than suicide, but there is pre- 
cious little encouragement for the suicide 
preventer. We all want crisis services to 
work, but if they do not, we should have the 
fortitude to discontinue them. 

To postpone attempts until answers are 
provided by experimental programs would be 
to ignore the evidence of common sense and 
clinical experiences (Rogers et aL, 1982).

OVERVIEW OF PREVENTION EFFORTS IN 
ADOLESCENT SUICIDE

SUMMARY 

The development of general suicide preven- 
tion efforts in the United States and b^ond 
is reviewed, with emphasis on the paucity of 
attention to youth suicide until recent years. 
Training programs are reviewed, again with 
few found specific to youth. A current sur- 
vey of prevention and intervention programs 
in the United States is introduced, detailing 
the types of programs which could be iden- 
tified. Special therapy needs of adolescents 
are considered, and recommendations for fu- 
ture programs are detailed. 

INTRODUCTION 

Suicide stands out among major causes of 
death when accounting for deaths which 
might have been prevented by an act of will. 
Prevention efforts in communicable diseases 
and in disorders with parameters influenced 
by human choice, such as lung cancer and 
smoking, are considered relatively effective; 
suicide, however, is the choice not to live and 
it can be prevented only by a change in 
choice. As a result, prevention efforts have 
held the attention of those concerned with 
suicide for as long as suicide has been ap- 
proached as a public health problem. During 
the past decade the dilemma of increasing 



rates of suicide by American youth has 
brought into focus the waste of life involved 
when the very young choose to take their 
lives. The purpose of this paper is to review 
what has been done in suicide prevention in 
the past and to summarize the types of 
suicide prevention efforts currently occur- 
ring in American communities, with specific 
reference to youth. 

HISTORICAL REVIEW 

The suicide prevention movement had its 
origins in the mid-1960s; there was little at- 
tention paid to suicide before that time. The 
authors studying suicide most often quoted 
in earlier years were Freud (1), and 
Durkheim (2). Freud believed that suicide 
was the ultimate example of introjected rage 
and self punishment; he also speculated on 
the existence of a separately operating, 
biologically established death instinct. 
DurkheiP"*' '^arly studies of sociological fac- 
tors associated with suicide are best remem- 
bered for his elaboration of the anomie of the 
suicidal individual. 

Of particular interest in the context of youth 
suicide was the 1910 meeting of the Vienna 



3-62 



67 



S. Comstock: Overview of Prevention Efforts. . . 



Psychoanalytic Society, reported in OnSuicide 
(3). The meeting was planned because of the 
suicide death of a school boy and focused on 
harmful influences affecting young people. 
Actually, suicide as a problem was well estab- 
lished long before the work of these two 
giants. Goethe, another literary giant, 
brought attention to romantic suicide in his 
book. The Sorrows of Young Werther. It is 
said that after Goethe's love-struck 
Werther's story was popularized (4), a num- 
ber of imitative suicides occurred among 
German youths. The romanticization of 
suicide may have accounted for other clusters 
of youth suicides over the years, although this 
phenomenon was not actively studied until 
very recent times when alarm over the in- 
crease in absolute numbers of youth suicides 
stimulated research. 

It was not suicide among the young that 
stimulated the beginning of the suicide 
prevention movement. During the 1960s, 
suicide prevention centers came into being in 
a number of different locations. The earliest 
centers generally developed out of the inter- 
est of mental health professionals and, for 
the most part, consisted of telephone 
answering services staffed by trained volun- 
teers offering crisis intervention counseling 
anonymously. 

Impetus was given to suicidology as a field of 
study by legislation enacted in the 1960j by 
the United States Congress. Early advocates 
for suicide as a deserving and needed field of 
study included Dr. Edwin Shneidman, Dr. 
Robert Litman, Dr. Norman Farberow, Dr. 
Harvey Resnik, Dr. Seymour Perlin, and 
others. The legislation established a Center 
for Studies of Suicide Prevention within the 
National Institute of Mental Health 
(NIMH). This center, headed first by Dr. 
Shneidman, and later by Dr. Resnick, 
provided a focus for suicide efforts over a 
number of years. 

Beginning in 1968, the center published the 
Bulletin of Suicidology. Research money 
distributed through its grant program gave 
major impetus to investigations throughout 
the nation. 



During and preceding this period in the 
United States, several organizations in other 
countries became involved in suicide preven- 
tion activities. The Samaritans organization 
originated in England and spread world- 
wide. Their activities are detailed in another 
paper in this volume. A parallel effort by 
Contact Teleministries world-wide ac- 
counted for many additional telephone 
answering, crisis intervention services. 

By 1968, sufficient interest in the field of 
suicide prevention had developed in the 
United States and a sufficient number of 
workers existed in the field to warrant a na- 
tional meeting. The first meeting was or- 
ganized in Chicago, Illinois under the 
sponsorship of the University of Chicago and 
became the formative meeting for the 
American Association of Suicidology 
(AA.S.). Suicidology was a new term intro- 
duced by a charter member and original 
leader of the association. Dr. Edwin Shneid- 
man, and indicated the scope of the new or- 
ganization, that is, the study of suicide and its 
psychological, sociological, and clinical 
manifestations. Despite the academic focus 
indicated by the title and expressed by the 
early members, an immediate division 
developed within the organization between 
those who were primarily invested in suicide 
prevention (especially the volunteers) and 
those who were academicians. Over the 
years this divergence of interests has persist- 
ed within the organization, nevertheless, the 
intent of the original organizers has been 
honored in that the A.A.S. has not been 
divided. It remains a multidisciplinary or- 
ganization where research and application 
reinforce one another. Through an annual 
national meeting, the organization has 
fostered research and reporting on varied 
aspects of suicide. One of its most important 
contributions has been the development of 
standards by which suicide prevention 
centers can be judged and certified. The 
organization's scientific journal and newslet- 
ter have had the desired effect of stimulating 
continuously increasing interest in the area.

Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



Youth suicide was a special focus among the 
early students of suicide. Review of the an- 
nual programs of the A.A.S. indicates that an 
increase in suicide among youth was noted as 
early as 1974, although the increase at thai 
point was not marked enough to allow firm 
conclusions about the dimensions of the 
problem. In the decade froir 1974 to 1984, 
the very clear increase in youth suicide was 
documented and led, not only to an increase 
in the number of publications and specialized 
programs in suicide prevention for youth, but 
also to specific federal responses. In 1979, 
the U.S. Public Heahh Service promulgated 
the 1990 Objectives for the Nation; among 
them were a number of objectives related to 
control of stress and violent behavior. 
NIMH created a staff petition relating to 
suicide issues, announced a programmatic 
goal of a 10 percent reduction in youth 
suicide in the next decade, and aimed for 
identification of crisis telephone services by 
60 percent of youth. Specific legislation at 
the State level, first in California and sub- 
sequently in other States, was introduced for 
dealing with suicide prevention programs for 
youth. In 1985, the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services established the Secretary's 
Task Force on Youth Suicide. A series of 
meetings and reports have been generated by 
this task force. 

During the approximately two decades when 
suicide prevention was a specific focus of 
professionals in the United States, the num- 
ber of suicide prevention programs steadily 
grew throughout the country. Since 1981, 
new programs dealing with primary preven- 
tion efforts in schools have been de*^^loped. 
Currently in the U.S. about 1,006 s .icide 
prevention or crisis programs have been 
identified exclusive of community mental 
health programs. Generally these programs 
were organized with goals broader than 
suicide prevention. Their names often 
reflect the broader crisis intervention pur- 
pose, such as Crisis Center, Telephone Hot- 
line, etc. Some, but by no means the 
majority, of these programs have established 
components specifically related to adoles- 
cent suicide. School programs have become 



quite widespread, generally having been in- 
itiated only after a suicide involving a student 
has brought the issue of youth suicide strong- 
ly into focus. In some instances, school 
programs are provided by outside experts, in 
others educational psychologists employed 
in school systems have developed training 
programs for student bodies. An ongoing 
component of these programs is the task of 
dealing with students directly affected when 
a close friend has died from suicide. 

In the late 1960s and early 1970s a number of 
crisis programs were organized specifically 
for the youth population and were advertised 
as such. They tended to use youthful volun- 
teers as telephone respondents. Typically, 
these programs were organized by young 
people, training was less rigorous than for the 
more general suicide prevention programs, 
and, for the most part, these programs have 
disappeared from American cities. There is 
some <^ppeal to the notion that a young per- 
son in V liis might prefer to talk to a willing 
peer volunteering in a telephone response 
service; nevertheless, the relative lack of sur- 
vival of these programs might suggest other- 
wise. In any case, the appropriate and 
adequate training of youthful volunteers 
remains problematic and has not been at- 
tempted by mast established services. 

Other suicide prevention efforts have 
developed in connection with the emergence 
of emergency psychiatry as a sub-specialty. 
Genera! and psychiatric hospitals have in- 
stalled discrete programs for dealing with 
emergencies brought to hospitals and with 
psychiatric aspects of medical treatment in 
general hospital emergency rooms. These 
programs encounter a large number of 
patients who have taken overdoses, and, 
especially in training hospitals around the 
country, have developed program com- 
ponents specific to suicide. Recognition of 
the need for ongoing care after emergency 
interventions with suicidal patients have led 
to the establishment of outpatient programs 
tor suicidal patients. Several centers provide 
ongoing care through therapy groups 
homogeneous for suicide ideation. Many of

these are located in public outpatient clinics 
associated with teaching hospitals, in com- 
munity mental health programs, anJ as walk- 
in services in a few suicide prevention 
centers. The author maintained a therapy 
group for several years for adolescent suicide 
attempters treated in a general hospital 
emergency room. Yet another type of 
suicide-related effort involves therapy 
groups for survivors of a suicide. IVpic^lly* 
these attract the parents of young people 
who killed themselves. Such groups exist as 
free-standing services staffed by mental 
health professionals. Many have developed 
as walk-in services in suicide prevention 
centers. 

AFFILIATIONS IN OTHER 
COUNTRIES 

Thus far, we have focused primarily on 
programs within the United S- ates. In fact, 
the suicide prevention movement was active 
in Europe earlier than in the United States. 
In 1960, the first international suicide 
prevention meeting was held and the Inter- 
national Association for Suicide Prevention 
was formed with central offices in Vienna. 
The name of the organization was later 
changed to indicate the broader interests 
shared by member organizations. It con- 
tinues today as the International 

Association for Suicide Prevention and Crisis 
Intervention. This group, like the A.A.S., 
holds plenary and regional meetings and 
publishes a scientific journal. The 25th an- 
niversary meeting was held in Vienna in 1985. 
The A.A.S. has functioned as a national 
member of the international association 
since A.A.S. was formed. 

SUICIDE PREVENTION 
TRAINING 

Training for mental health professionals in 
the area of suicide prevention has increased 
steadily in recent years as the visibility of 
suicide, especially among adolescents and 
youth increased. Schools of social work, 
nursing, psychology, and psychiatry have par- 



ticipated in and expanded their emphasis on 
training. There remains, however, a substan- 
tial lack of uniformity among programs 
across the country; some refer to suicide 
prevention in single lectures and case 
reviews, and others provide discrete cur- 
riculum segments containing many h "^urs of 
both didactic teaching and case experience in 
suicide prevention. The scope of instruction 
in professional schools generally covers the 
identiHcation of populations at risk, in- 
dividual case assessment techniques with 
respect to suicide risk, techniques in crisis in- 
tervention relevant to suicidal persons, and 
special care needs of particularly high-risk 
populations. Specific attention to adoles- 
cent suicide may not go beyond acknow- 
ledging that suicide in this group has shown 
recent increases. The dilemma for profes- 
sional schools is that a well-deHned body of 
knowledge about adolescent suicide does not 
yet exist and few individuals have specific ex- 
perience or training in this area to be able to 
teach it well. 

Several specialized training programs 
deserve mention. The National Institute of 
Mental Health provided funding since 1967 
for a fellowship program in suicidology at the 
Johns Hopkins University School of 
Medicine. One outcome of this program, 
headed by Dr. Seymour Perlin, was a hand- 
book (5) which provided an important 
resource for other training programs (4). Of 
interest, this volume published in 1975, did 
not index adolescents or youth or teens, an 
accurate reflection that special concern for 
youth had not yet emerged. Many of the cur- 
rent leaders in the field were trained in that 
program. After the close of the Johns Hop- 
kins program, there was no specific training 
opportunity for individuals motivated for an 
academic career in suicidology. Recently Dr. 
Ronald Maris developed a new fellowship 
program at the University of South Carolina 
which offers promise of renewed leadership 
in the field. 

It seems to be the general case that programs 
for physician's assistants and on-site inter- 
veners such as emergency medical tech-

nicians (EMTs) and policemen are relatively 
unsophisticated in suicide prevention treat- 
ment Model curricula have been developed 
for these groups and have been promulgated 
by the American Psychiatric Association's 
Task Force on Emergency Psychiatry Care 
Issues (6). 

The situation for volunteers in suicide 
prevention centers is relatively better 
defined than that for mental health profes- 
sionals. Training curricula for volunteers 
have been developed (7) and widely 
promoted and standards and criteria for 
training of volunteers has improved the 
uniformity of training around the country. 
The scope of training for center volunteers 
includes didactic instruction in crisis inter- 
vention techniques, experiential involve- 
ment through role-playing, and supervised 
participation in crisis work on telephone 
lines. Volunteers often become extremely 
proficient in dealing with people in crisis and 
may have more training for this task than do 
mental health professionals. It remains the 
case however, that specific training in deal- 
ing with adolescents is not separately ad- 
dressed in most programs. 

Textbooks devoted in whole or in part to 
suicide prevention ii evitably lag a number of 
years behind the current state of knowledge 
in the field. It is not surprising that the recent 
books offer relatively little in the area of 
adolescent suicide prevention. Several 
books, in the past two years, do address this 
area and include Ytmth Suicide, (Peck, et al. 
8). 

Two scientific journals are devoted to 
suicide-related topics: Suicide and Life 
Threatening Behavior, the journal of the 
A.AS., and Suicide, the journal of the Inter- 
national Association of Suicide Prevention 
and Crisis Intervention. An earlier publica- 
tion. Bulletin ofSuicidology was published by 
NIMH during the years of the Center for 
Studies of Suicide Prevention. 

There have been some efforts to develop 
model curricula in suicide prevention. Dr. 
James Lomax has written curriculum recom- 



mendations for psychiatry residency 
programs which were accepted by the or- 
ganization of heads of psychiatric training 
programs and is available from them (9,10). 
Dr. Alan Berman, in heading an educational 
committee for the American Association of 
Suicidology, collected curricula from training 
programs around the country and developed 
specific professional training recommenda- 
tions. 

The most effective way to upgrade educa- 
tional emphasis in an area is to influence the 
accreditation examinations in that area. Ef- 
forts have been made, for example, to in- 
crease the number of questions about suicide 
and its prevention in the examinations of the 
American Board of Psychiatry and Neurol- 
ogy. These examination questions have not 
yet focused directly on adolescent suicide, 
but it is hoped that they will do so in the fu- 
ture. 

The development of standards in suicide 
prevention efforts has been a uniquely thor- 
ny problem. Standards of care are needed 
both in specific suicide prevention programs 
and in any program offering mental health 
services. Workers have been reluctant to 
delineate highlyspecificstandardsbecauseof 
the likelihood of related litigation in the 
event of a completed suicide. A.AS. has 
considerable experience with standards 
developed more than a decade ago for 
suicide prevention centers (11). These were 
organized as minimal standards of com- 
petence for programs and have been used as 
the basis for a certification process for suicide 
prevention centers. This has been an out- 
standing effort in that it has had obvious and 
gratifying impact on the quality of services 
developed within programs and has not in- 
duced troublesome litigation. 

In contrast, the experience of hospitals in es- 
tablishing suicide prevention standards has 
been very mixed. Tremendous lack of 
uniformity easts among hospitals around the 
nation in policies directed to suicide preven- 
tion. Some hospitals have very strict require- 
ments whereas others have decided to do 
nothing in order to avoid the problems of 



3-66

diversity in care (12). A.A.S. has worked for 
a number of years in surveying hospital prac- 
tices and currently is developing a set of 
recommendations for consideration by the 
Joint Commission on Accreditation of 
Hospitals. The latter group has been reluc- 
tant to establish standards for care of suicidal 
individuals although it does require 
documentation of risk assessment. In con- 
trast, a major care provider, the Veteran's 
Administration (V.A.), has had a set of nurs- 
ing regulatii ns and a manual on suicidal and 
violent patients for several years. These 
standards are far more specific than are those 
encountered in the private sector. It is un- 
clear whether these have substantially raised 
the awareness and sensitivity of V.A. staff 
members to suicide issues compared to 
professionals in the private sector. As ex- 
pected, the V.A standards did not address 
youth suicide as a special problem. Since 
adolescents requiring psychiatric hospitaliza- 
tion generally are segregated from the adult 
population, it seems likely that a professional 
group such as the American Society for 
Adolescent Psychiatiy may become involved 
in development of specialized standards of 
care for this group. 

SUICIDE PREVENTION 
EFFICACY 

One of the most troublesome aspects for 
planners in the area of suicide prevention for 
adolescents is the lack of substantial and con- 
vincing data about the efficacy of existing 
programs. Outcome research is made dif- 
ficult by the mobility of the young popula- 
tion, the lack of adequate and accurate 
reporting of suicide deaths, and ethical 
dilemmas encountered when specific inter- 
vention programs are to be compared to a 
control population deemed equally at risk; 
that is, withholding intervention from 
populations at risk cannot be sanctioned. A 
few outcome studies have been greeted with 
enthusiasm but also with considerable 
methodological criticism. One study in- 
volved the comparison of similar towns in 
England wheie the Samaritans were and 



were not active, with a favorable decline in 
the suicide rate in the town where the 
Samaritans intervened through a program of 
befriending those identified as being at risk 
(13). Another piece of evidence involved, the 
cessation of carbon-monoxide-producing 
coal oil as a cooking fuel in Great Britain with 
a corresponding drop in the suicide rate (14). 
These data have been particularly interesting 
to advocates of firearms control in the United 
States because they suggest that the control 
of a popular means of suicide may indeed in- 
fluence the overall frequency of death. 
Lester has reported a correlation across 
States between handgun control and suicide 
(15) and most important, has extended his 
analysis to show fewer adolescent deaths in 
States with stricter controls (16). No con- 
vincing studies, as yet, in adolescent suicide 
show that specific Idnds of intervention other 
than gun control absolutely decrease the 
suicide rate. The shifts in the suicide rate 
over time are confounding variables. It ap- 
pears, for example, that the alarming rise 
during the past 15 years in adolescent suicide 
is now reaching a plateau and we may be ex- 
periencing the beginning of a gratifying drop 
in these deaths. The stated goal of the 
Department of Health and Human Services 
to achieve a 10 (>ercent drop in adolescent 
suicide may have been fortuitously timed. 
That, of course, does not guarantee that any- 
thing efficacious has been done. The task of 
identifying suitable comparison groups and 
discretely defined intervention strategies 
remains for researchers in the future. 

PUBLIC AWARENESS 

In the absence of interventions of proven ef- 
ficacy, suicide prevention planners intuitive- 
ly have assumed that factual information 
serves the public well and that increased sen- 
sitivity to adolescent suicide may decrease its 
occurrence. This area of concern has been 
enjoying considerable popularity in recent 
years as evidenced by a number of television 
documentaries treating the problem of 
adolescent suicide in some depth. The 
human interest potential for such program- 



72 



3-67 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on vbuth Suicide 



ming is veiy high and, in general, the quality 
of media productions has been considered 
high. The national media, when airing such 
documentaries, have taken responsibility for 
alerting community service providers and for 
developing ^cpert commentary on the con- 
tent of such programs, particularly \sdth the 
goal of guarding against suicide by suggestion 
to viewers and listeners. One network dis- 
tributed elaborate and high quality school 
curriculum materials in advance of airing a 
youth suicide documentary (17). 

Local school districts have become alerted to 
the problems of adolescent suicide and have 
responded with a great variety of suicide 
prevention programs in schools. Most of 
these include educational efforts to heighten 
the awareness within the student body of the 
possibility of intervention by friends when a 
troubled youth is identifieid. School cur- 
riculum planning is very active in this area at 
the present time. In various locales, depend- 
ing on school personnel, educational 
psychologists and guidance counselors make 
classroom presentations or invite outside 
professionals to teach about youth suicide. 
Charlotte Ross in California was a pioneer in 
the latter type (18). Schools also have stimu- 
lated parent-teacher organizations to attend 
to this area and presentations in their annual 
programming are becoming very frequent. 
AA.S. is currently collecting suicide preven- 
tion materials developed for schools and will 
develop specific recommendations and 
models for school awareness programs. In a 
closely related development, A.A.S. and 
other groups are giving attention to plans for 
school intervention programs when suicides 
occur or are threatened. 

PROBLEMS IN SUICIDE 
PREVENTION 

One of the major difficulties in planning for 
suicide prevention programs is that 
parameters for identifying the population at 
risk are so non-sf>ecinc that inevitably a very 
large population must be dealt with. Inter- 
ventions focusing on public awareness ob- 
viously do not suffer from this problem and 



this may account for the great amount of 
energy directed toward that effort. George 
Murphy (19) has clearly defined the dilemma 
of overinclusiveness of risk measures. For 
example, very high risk groups, such as 
suicidal manic depressive and schizophrenic 
patients are underrepresented in the adoles- 
cent population. For groups in which suicide 
risk can be identiHed by individual behavior, 
such as suicide attempt or threat, the actual 
risk is only about S percent and all cases iden- 
tified in advance account only for about 20 
percent of the eventual fatalities (20). 
Prevention efforts, then, must be rather 
broadly directed and must approach in- 
dividual dynamic issues which in the future 
may be found to be associated with suicidal 
impulses in youth. 

A further problem in implementing suicide 
prevention efforts arises from the conflicting 
need to control the behavior of an identified 
potentially suicidal individual on the one 
hand, and the need to promote growth and 
personal responsibility on the other hand. 
Every therapist is or should be aware of this 
conflict in every situation of intervention 
with potentially suicidal youth. There seems 
to be great variation among therapists in the 
way this is addressed. Some go to great 
lengths to prevent the possibility of death, 
even though this provides considerable inter- 
ference in the progress of therapy. Others 
reason that some suicidal deaths inevitably 
will occur even in therapy and that the 
greater preservation of life and quality of life 
is assured by promoting personal respon- 
sibility on the part of suicidal individuals. 
With so much disagreement among 
therapists it seems unlikely that clear stand- 
ards for intervention techniques can be 
developed. 

There is a further conflict in the intervention 
models endorsed for suicide prevention ef- 
forts. Historically, major emphasis has been 
given to the crisis model where suicide is seen 
as a time-limited crisis in the life of an in- 
dividual whose pre- and post-crisis ego func- 
tions are at a reliable level. The task 
addressed in the crisis model is that of 



3-68 



73 



fl. Comstock: Overview of Prevention Efforts. . . 



restraining destructive acts by the individual 
until the crisis is passed. This seems a defen- 
sible model with considerable support from 
existing crisis intervention services^ even in 
the absence of rigorous research validation. 
In contrast) a number of suicidologists see 
suicide as an end-point in a suicidal life style. 
Both Edwin Shneidman (21) and Ronald 
Maris (22) have written extensively on this 
point of view. 

Indeed) most clinicians from time to time 
have had experience with a chronically 
suicidal individual. Such experiences dis- 
courage adherence to the crisis model. It is 
possible^ of course^ for an individual therapist 
working with an individual client to ac* 
complish some combination of these view- 
pointS) paying attention equally to the 
meaning over time of self destructive pat- 
terns in the individual and to the crisis which 
occurs when a suicide impulse is active. In 
program planning^ however^ such individual- 
ized attention may be neglected. Suicide in- 
terventions tend to be very time-limited with 
relative neglect of the important areas of 
referral and long-term followup. 

Lx)nger term treatment of suicidal youth ap- 
propriately expands beyond the issue of the 
self-destructive behavior which typically is 
the cause for initiating therapy^ and which is 
often referred to as a cry for help. Review of 
the dynamics of youth self-destruction in- 
evitably becomes a review of the multiple 
psychological tasks required in the passage 
into adulthood and of the psychopathology 
specific to this age group. For the purpose of 
this overview paper, only a few points will be 
made. 

In satisfactory maturation, the adolescent or 
young adult reworks, in a definitive way, the 
conflict between the wish to gain security 
from the care provided by others a nd the wish 
to gain independence and self reliance. 
Under the best of circumstances this conflict 
produces trial solutions and failures, disap- 
pointments, and changes of direction. The 
extraordinary grandiosity of mid-adoles- 
cence, when anything seems possible and 
confidence may outreach wisdom, must be 



revised in the light of limitations in personal 
abilities, so<;ial resources, and the exclusions 
required by progress in a particular direction. 
Major changes in interpersonal relationships 
occur, especially in families; and investments 
in relationships outside the family become 
crucial. This is the interval when, if develop- 
ment is satisfactory, self concept reaches a 
relatively stable form, including such impor- 
tant aspects as body image^ self esteem, self 
motivation, and differentiation from others. 
Failures in this stabilization of self concept 
have far-reaching consequences. 

Youth suicide in general terms can be under- 
stood as a reaction to living with such failures. 
The compelling question in the context of 
recent increases in youth suicide is Vhy 
now?" The compelling need in intervention 
in youth suicide, in the absence of useful 
answers to that question, is for individualized 
work with individuals in distress. Crisis inter- 
ventions, at best, can keep a young person 
alive during a period of very high risk and can 
facilitate entry into longer-term therapy. It 
is mainly in the course of longer work that the 
individual life course can be altered. 

Crisis events at times are referred to as 
growth opportunities, and this idea has merit 
both in the sense that crisis-anxiety promotes 
development of new coping skills and in the 
sense that failing character defenses become 
rather transparent during crisis, making it 
relatively easy to grasp underlying dynamics. 
It must be remembered, however, that a 
protective boost through a crisis interval also 
may reinforce a young person's sense of in- 
competence. The quality of work done in 
crisis resolution is critical to the final impact 
of the crisis, and that work may require an ex- 
tended therapy interval. 

With respect to adolescent suicide there ex- 
ists a troublesome lack of convincing data on 
the outcome of intervention techniques, on 
the means by which suicide ideation and 
urges seem to be contagious in groups of 
young people, and on the importance of 
major sociological variables such as family 
mobility, divorce in the family, changes in 
academic standards in schools, lack of youth

optimism about future employment, etc 
TTiere is immediate need for research in all 
of these areas. 

TYPES OF PREVENTION 
PROGRAMS 

In preparation for the National Qjnference 
on Prevention and Intervention in Youth 
Suicide, a research task force in Houston sur- 
veyed programs throughout the United 
States which may provide services to suicidal 
youth. Details of the methodology and sum- 
mary results are presented in a separate 
paper (23), and a survey analyzing charac- 
teristics uf programs, by program type, are 
presented in another paper (24). For the sur- 
vey, programs were classified as crisis phone 
lines, walk-in crisis clinics, hospital-based 
emergency programs, mental health centers 
with crisis components, school intervention 
programs, free standing crisis stabilization 
units with beds, and combination programs. 
It is noteworthy that these programs consis- 
tently identified a combination of prevention 
and intervention goals. They seem generally 
to subscribe to a crisis model of intervention, 
although most programs described extensive 
referral linkage in their communities. 
Neither their titles nor their services defined 
them as being organized specifically to 
respond to youth clients. Probably the single 
outstanding result of this surv^ was to learn 
that adolescent suicide has not, as yet, had 
direct impact on community agencies except 
for schools. 

In yet another paper, the responses of com- 
munities where youth suicide has had special 
visibility are discussed (25). Clusters of 
adolescent suicides are special and alarming 
events. They have been reported from many 
regions of the country, from small com- 
munities and large but common characteris- 
tics that might identify communities at risk 
have not emerged. Current research will 
contribute better understanding of this 
phenomenon. Interventions in youth suicide 
clusters generally have provided emergency 
training for school personnel, awareness 
education for students, rapid reinforcement 



of the treatment community by refenal net- 
works, and organizing professional volunteer 
services. As yet, no systematic examination 
of the effectiveness of such efforts has been 
performed, and no natural history of a cluster 
has been defined. It is not known whether 
the interventions undertaken have 
decreased or increased the suicides, although 
it seems that they have been effective in en- 
ding the clusters. Detailed case studies are 
needed, with particular attention to the role 
of the media. 

ADOLESCENT SUICIDE 
PREVENTION NEEDS 

In evaluating the planning for expansion of 
the services available in any community for 
the prevention of youth suicide, the follow- 
ing considerations seem important. 

First, programs within the community need 
to be especiallyvisible to young people. This 
can be accomplished through public service 
announcements of entry sites, especially for 
suicide prevention programs. At least two 
types of crisis services are needed: those 
available by telephone contacts and those 
available for individuals identified in hospi- 
tals as suicidal youth. To this may be added 
crisis services for individuals identified in 
schools where the intervention needs go 
beyond the capability of school personnel. 
For all of these entry categories, a strong 
referral network is needed. 

Second, there is unfortunately, substantial 
loss of individuals who have undergone some 
treatment in the course of a suicidal crisis and 
been referred for on-going therapy. The 
referral network needs to be well understood 
within the community and should include the 
following components: 1) Therapists ex- 
perienced in family therapy, especially fami- 
ly ;herapy involving adolescents. 2) 
Specialized support groups of peers. (Ex- 
perience shows that the old-fashioned adage 
against dealing with suicidal people together 
in a group is unwarranted-such therapy 
seems to work.) 3) Social work assistance 
needs to be available to troubled youth to at-

tend to specialized needs, including residen- 
tial placement, educational needs, and legal 
help. 4) Long term psychotherapy needs to 
be available. This is especially true in the 
public sector where it often may be difficult 
to obtain. 5) Both hospital and partial hospi- 
tal programs need to be available with staCb 
trained speciGcally in dealing with suicidal 
youth. Partial hospital programs are espe- 
cially attractive for the large number of in- 
dividuals who have survived through a 
suicide crisis, have no immediate suicide in- 
tent, and can both remain in contact with 
school and family and simultaneously can 
have the advantage of daily part-time hospi- 
tal treatment.

SUMMARY 

The typical community reactions to disaster, 
as identified from the literature, parallel in- 
dividual reactions, including death-preoc- 
cupation, guilt, psychic numbing, rage, and a 
search for explanations. Adolescent suicide 
clusters are examples of disasters of limited 
scope but nevertheless generate fear respon- 
ses because of their uncertain duration and 
extent, and their implication that something 
is wrong with community quality of life. A 
cluster of suicides in Clear Lake, Texas is 
reported as a case study, and recommenda- 
tions for community planning are suggested. 

INTRODUCTION 

Youth suicide is increasing; knowing that it is 
increasing invokes many questions. Is there 
something about the quality of community 
life in recent times that accounts for the in- 
crease? What is the role of the family as an 
institution? Is the growing instability of 
families and the frequency of divorce direct- 
ly connected with the increased incidence of 
adolescent suicide? What are the roles of 
other institutions in our communities: chur- 
ches, schools, the justice system, the media, 
and mental health service providers? Are 
these institutions failing our young people in 



some crucial way or ways that connect direct- 
ly with the increase in adolescent suicide? 
How have communities responded to adoles- 
cent suicides? How should they respond? 

A significant literature exists on community 
responses to natural and to man-made dis- 
asters from which much can be learned about 
the after-effects of crisis on survivors and 
about responses of individuals and com- 
munity groups not directly involved in the dis- 
asters (1). How these experiences and data 
obtained from them can be applied to adoles- 
cent suicide has hardly been studied. 

The suicide death of a young person is a 
remarkably personal and private event, but it 
has powerful impact on many others who 
knew the dead youth. Since the network of 
acquaintances of a young person tends to be 
large through school contacts, and because a 
young person's death is so unexpected, youth 
suicide generates complex bereavement pat- 
terns and invites comparison with the 
bereavement tasks following a disaster. 
When a cluster of adolescent suicides occurs 
and is reported in the media, many more 
comparisons are invited. Lifton (2,3) has 
identified five survivor reactions after a dis- 
aster: death-preoccupation, guilt, psychic

numbing, poorly focused rage, and a search 
for meaning or explanation. These seem 
easily transferable to the situation following 
adolescent suicide clusters. 

Green (4) reviewed studies of psychological 
sequelae of disasters and emphasizes the im- 
portance of the geographic centrality of 
events as det *rminants of outcome. For ex- 
ample, a plane cr&sh does not affect the sup- 
port network of survivors, and is considered 
a peripheral disaster. A natv<ral disaster, 
however, may cause death, property loss, and 
residential displacement within a com- 
munity, and thus is a central disaster. Erick- 
son (S) focused on the community response 
to disasters, studying the Buffalo Creek flood 
where whole communities were destroyed. 
He suggests that the availability of pre-exist- 
ing community support is a critical factor in 
the severity of disaster sequelae. These ob- 
servations seem relevant to planning com- 
munity responses to suicides. Suicide 
clusters are relatively central events in com- 
munities, although they do not involve 
property loss or residential displacement. 
Applying a typology developed by Berren et 
al. (6), a suicide cluster is a man-made crisis, 
which has a slow onset, affects the com- 
munity widely but has relatively few in- 
dividuals directly at risk, has a worrisome 
potential for reoccurrence, and has limited 
possibilities for control over its future im- 
pact. The impact of a suicide can be 
prolonged and fosters widespread fear in the 
community. Because it is difficult to know 
when the impact has ended, uncertainty 
tends to heighten anxiety. 

EMOTIONAL REACTIONS TO 
SUICIDE 

Cluster suicides evoke many more emotion- 
al reactions within communities than do in- 
dividual suicides. In general, these reactions 
follow patterns common to other kinds of 
crisis events within communities. What are 
referred to as community emotional reac- 
tions are not, in fact, very different from in- 
dividual reactions in an individual crisis. 
They include: initial disbeliefor denial of any 



direct impact of the crisis, followed by an in- 
terval of questioning: "Why our com- 
munity?" "What is wrong here?" Fear 
develops in the community. In the case of 
adolescent suicide, the fear is related direct- 
ly to concern that the cluster of suicides may 
not have ended. A mentality develops in the 
community of waiting for the next bad news 
to arrive. Collective fear extends beyond the 
concern for the lives of individuals and the ef- 
fects of suicide deaths; it is also fear that 
something mysterious, poorly understood, 
and obviously lethal is afoot in the com- 
munity. A subsequent reaction may be one 
of outrage. "Too much is being made of this ! " 
"Why don't people just leave us alone?", etc. 

Following the painful reactions of confusion, 
fear, and outrage, a number of pathological 
defenses can be identified. Obviously, dif- 
ferent individuals in the community react in 
different ways and labeling reactions as 
pathological defenses does not imply that a 
community is "sick"; but the defensive nature 
of these reactions and their connection with 
shared, painful emotions seem clear. Defen- 
sive reactions include efforts to place blame; 
for example, people may believe the fault is 
with the school or family instability, or that 
drug abuse is ruining the lives of our young 
people. The message behind any blaming ef- 
fort is "we are not to blame", that is, an effort 
to dispel a sense of guilt which a community 
attaches to the suicide crisis. A different 
defense reaction is isolation. Communities 
turn inward in a crisis and become curiously 
resistant to interventions from elsewhere. A 
third defensive posture is detachment. "This 
does not involve us;" "Yes, I guess there is 
something going on over there somewhere- 
we do not know anything about it." 

The final or resolution phase of crisis reac- 
tions, when viewed from a community 
perspective, may range from acceptance of 
an ongoing stigmatization in relation to the 
crisis, to a gradual restoration of the status 
existing before the crisis. Various efforts 
may be made to address the causes of the 
crisis and possible preventive actions and 
long-term efforts to deal with the aftermath 



73

Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



of the crisis. In the specific instance of a 
suicide cluster generating a community crisis^ 
the tendency is certainly toward return to the 
status quo, although many preventive efforts 
seem appropriate. 

Of all the community reactions to a suicide 
crisis, probably the one most troublesome 
and most deserving of attention is the fear 
response. It seems to be precisely because 
the phenomenon of cluster suicides is so 
poorly understood, that in the course of such 
suicides a sense of great fear develops. A 
remarkably different course is easy to im- 
agine if, in fact, the causes of suicide clusters 
were well understood, if interventions had 
been researched, and the most effective in- 
terventions identiHed. In such a situation 
communities would marshall efforts with the 
conHdence that they were doing somethin,^ 
appropriate and that the situation would be 
contained. 

That clusters of suicides are a distinct 
phenomenon has been appreciated only 
recently even though they have been 
reported for many decades. It is understood 
that not every suicide cluster is like every 
other. When faced with multiple suicides, 
communities must wonder within the context 
of their speciHc community what is going on 
and what can be done. The way is open for 
all sorts of fantasies and worst-case accounts. 
Fear of a lethal phenomenon which is not un- 
derstood is a normal and predictable 
response. In my estimation, fear contributes 
very substantially to what can be identified as 
community reactions in cluster suicide. 

CLEAR LAKE TEXAS AS A 
CASE STUDY 

The Gear Lake area in southeast Texas is a 
circle of towns around Clear Lake, the best 
known of these being the city of Clear Lake, 
where NASA's Johnson Space Center is lo- 
cated. The population center is about 70 
miles from the center of Houston. 

In October 1984, residents of Clear Lake, 
Houston, and the surrounding communities 
became aware that they were experiencing a 



cluster of adolescent suicides. A sense of 
emergency developed and a great deal of ac- 
tivity was generated in an effort to identify, 
understand, and intervene appropriately to 
put a stop to the youths' deaths. 

Two former students of the Clear Creek In- 
dependent School District, both age 19, 
killed themselves in August and in Septem- 
ber 1984. Because they were not connected 
directly with the student body at the time and 
because the deaths were separated by more 
than a month, no significance was attached at 
the time to these two deaths, other than that 
attached to any suicide-that is, grief for the 
families and sadness among those who knew 
of the deaths. Later, on September 28th, a 
very popular high school student died in an 
auto^icycle accident. It was stated that his 
death was "mourned throughout the school 
district" because of the prominence of the 
student and the considerable sense of 
tragedy associated with his death. Six days 
later, on October 4, another former student, 
also 19 years old, killed himself. No crisis was 
sensed at this time, but within a week of that 
death, on the 5th, 9th, and 11th of October, 
three high school students killed themselves, 
making four adolescent suicides in the com- 
munity in one week and a total of six suicides 
in a two-month period. By the fourth suicide, 
the school district was convinced that there 
was problem; and by the time of the sixth 
suicide the entire community had been 
alerted by the media. A very considerable 
sense of dread developed. 

Following the acknowledgment by the school 
district and the media-generated publicity of 
the cluster of suicides, a great many com- 
munity actions occurred. The Clear Creek 
Independent School District called in two 
professionals from Houston, who had pre- 
vious exF>erience in suicide, as consultants. 
They also contracted with the Houston 
Psychiatric Society to intervene with the 
families of the dead students and former stu- 
dents. The school district administration or- 
ganized, publicized, and held a public 
meeting specifically for parents of all stu- 
dents to review what had happened and what 



3-74

was being done. The school district held a 
press conference which was attended by rep- 
resentatives of the major national news ser- 
vices as well as by the local media. The school 
district established an in-school intervention 
process which included meetings, by grades, 
with all junior and senior high school stu- 
dents led by a group of clinical and education- 
al psychologists, some of whom were hired on 
a temporary basis. Meetings were held be- 
tween the psychologists and all the teachers 
and guidance counselors. An internal system 
was established for identifying children who 
seemed at risk for suicide on any basis, for 
counseling those children, and for facilitating 
referrals for treatment if that was deemed ap- 
propriate. The school district consultants or- 
ganized a treatment referral network 
through professional organizations related 
to psychotherapy. Hospital beds and profes- 
sionals offering treatment were identified 
and agreements were made to provide no- 
cost or low-cost therapy whenever it was in- 
dicated for children referred by the school 
district Referrals, of course, were possible 
only when parents cooperated with them. 
Dozens of volunteer professionals par- 
ticipated in evaluating students and in estab- 
lishing therapeutic interventions. In 
addition to these efforts, a number of or- 
ganizations providing mental health services 
announced special services available in the 
Gear Lake area. These included teams from 
Houston International Hospital; the Family 
Emergency Intervention Team from the 
Houston Oiild Guidance Center, and special 
services provided by the Bay Area Crisis Hot- 
line. The Houston Crisis Intervention Ser- 
vice, which is linked organizationally with the 
Crisis Hotline, provided major leadership 
and provided many volunteers to deal with 
calls from distressed residents of the com- 
munity. The Houston Psychiatric Society es- 
tablished teams of its members who 
intervened directly with the families and 
friends of those who had killed themselves. 
Community leaders, drawn from the Clear 
Lake area and from Houston, organized a 
series of planning meetings with leadership 
from the Mental Health Association and the 



Houston Crisis Intervention Service, and 
sponsored a public forum on adolescent 
suicide. In Houston, a research group of rep- 
resentatives from the major academic institu- 
tions was organized to try to reach better 
understanding of the phenomenon in the 
Clear Lake area and to develop other re- 
search efforts related to adolescent suicide. 

A number of problems were encountered in 
the course of al! of these activities. It seems 
most fitting to discuss the things that did not 
go well. 

Residents in the Clear Lake area felt con- 
siderably intruded upon by the flurry of ac- 
tivities resulting from the cluster of 
adolescent suicides. Some expressed con- 
cern that they felt indicted by the suggestion 
that there was something wrong in the com- 
munity. 

Second, a number of mental health profes- 
sionals in the community felt disregarded 
when their offers to provide assistance were 
not accepted. No mechanism was in place for 
identifying the individuals who had relevant 
experience and ocpertise in suicide beyond 
the usual training and experience of every 
mental health professional. Every mental 
health professional considers himself of her- 
self an expert in suicide, because this is a 
problem encountered from time to time in al- 
most any work setting. In the Gear Lake 
situation, it was considered desirable to iden- 
tify those professionals most qualified in 
specific suicide-related experience. A num- 
ber of children were referred to Galveston 
and Houston for treatment. As a result, the 
professionals in the Gear Lake area felt that 
their turf had been intruded upon. 

A third problem involved the lack of clarity 
about roles and responsibilities for the many 
agencies that were mandated to respond to 
any community crisis. Agency repre- 
sentatives came to Clear Lake from three 
counties and seven municipalities with a high 
level of interest and motivation to provide 
services. Regrettably, no clear network was 
established with the Clear Lake community 
by which the services could be administered. 



so

A fourth problem, related to the third, had to 
do with unclear community leadership. The 
school district responded rapidly in estab- 
lishing a case-finding and referral network 
which seemed to function relatively well. 
The school administration was veiy clear, 
however, in stating that it was not a treatment 
entity and that it wanted more appropriate 
community agencies to take over that 
responsibility whenever possible. Clear 
leadership for this task actually did not 
emerge. In a series of planning meetings, 
community leaders attempted to organize 
themselves; these meetings for the most part 
were orderly and congenial but th^ involved 
the kind of status-seeking group process and 
jockeying for position that is inevitable when 
people come together who have no structure 
for working together. 

A nfth problem, related to the previous two, 
involved the need perceived by almost 
everyone for an orderly transfer of initiative 
from outsiders temporarily coming to the 
community to the community agencies and 
leadership already in place. Despite general 
agreement that this should happen, no clear 
plan ever vas worked out by which it would 
happen: as a result, a number of plans initial- 
ly greeted with energy and enthusiasm in fact 
floundered; and, to my knowledge, no long- 
term plans have emerged for community ac- 
tivity centered on adolescent suicide. 

A sixth problem involved the media. There 
seems to be general agreement that media 
personnel in the Clear Lake suicides, in 
general, behaved responsibly and recorded 
events accurately. Nevertheless, some in- 
trusions were problematic. In the first week, 
the school grounds adjacent to the ad- 
ministration building were encircled by 
reporters waiting for students to leave the 
grounds, the reporters having been barred 
from school property. Students were as- 
sailed by cameras, microphones, and the as- 
sociated people, and were asked rapid-fire 
questions: "Do you know anyone who has 
committed suicide? Are you thinking about 
killing yourself? Do you know anybody who 
is going to kill himself? What would you do 



if it were a friend of yours?" etc. It is doubt- 
ful that anyone could answer graciously or 
even sensibly to such a barrage of questions. 
The media continued to be problematic be- 
cause of the possibility of suggestion received 
by vulnerable or at-risk individuals. 

A seventh problem identified in Clear Lake 
was defining how extensive the problem was. 
The suicides occurred in a deHned com- 
munity served by one school district. A con- 
siderable number of volunteers and media 
and civic planners who flowed into this area 
focused on the identifled problem and 
problem area. Simultaneously, a number of 
other youth suicides were reported in neigh- 
boring areas. Overall, these received far less 
attention than did the Clear Lake group 
simply because they were in outlying 
geographic areas. There was no equally 
coordinated effort to deal with the so-called 
"outliers" which, in fact, may have been re- 
lated, in some as yet undefined way, to the 
Clear Lake cluster. 

The eighth problem, already referred to 
briefly, has to do with geographical divisions 
and community organization. The Clear 
Lake area in fact involves so many 
governmental groups that coordinated plan- 
ning in a community crisis was extremely dif- 
flcuU. Parts of three counties were involved, 
and 7 different police departments were in- 
volved in one way or another from 7 different 
municipalities. Part of the area received 
public mental health services administered 
from Austin and other parts received mental 
health services administered from com- 
munity programs. The Clear Lake area cer- 
tainly is not unique in having so many 
adjacent communi^ organizations. In such 
an organizationally complicated area the 
need for a preplanned mental health 
response is especially clear. 

On the positive side, a number of good things 
happened in the Clear Lake experience. At 
the top of the list, of course, is that no further 
suicides occurred after the week with the 
four suicides. In addition, appropriate inter- 
ventions were made and a number of at-risk 
children were successfully referred and es-

tablished in needed therapy. A third positive 
outcome of the experience is that a more 
careful look at community response and 
problem identification was made possible. 

COMMUNITY BEHAVIOR IN 
CRISIS 

Li leviewing the Clear Lake suicide cluster as 
a case study, a number of issues about group 
behavior present themselves. Often the 
same vocabulary and the same ideas are ap- 
plied to individual and to group psychology; 
however, some comments about the 
similarities and differences are in order. 

It is the case that groups experience shared 
emotions. Groups are made up of individuals 
with memories in common and frequently 
prevailing or unifying ideas and behavior can 
be identified. On the other hand, these com- 
mon themes within groups are less stable 
than are parallel emotions and ideas and be- 
havior in individuals. This is true particular- 
ly because the participants vary over time and 
groups are not themselves stably constituted. 
In referring to whole communities as groups, 
it is esfiecially true that there is not the kind 
of strict connection between past and 
present experience that is encountered in in- 
dividuals. For qj^ple, in the Clear Lake 
area there are suD-communities which have 
had remarkably stable populations where 
parents and grandparents have been in the 
same homes and the shared memories and 
sense of community past are very strong. 
Other areas within the community involve a 
very mobile population, many members of 
which have very short histories in the com- 
munity and cannot share in the sense of 
longer-term memory and stability. 

When a crisis occurs, shock and disbelief are 
normal individual and group reactions. 
There tends to be an early effort to grasp the 
dimensions of what has happened. This may 
vary from wild over-estimation In a rather 
sensational way to problematic under-es- 
limation in the form of denial that anything 
very serious is going on. Specific negative 
reactions to crisis discussed earlier include 



fear, resentment, guilt, blaming, isolation, 
and opposition to interventions. Community 
planning for intervention in a suicide crisis 
certainly needs to take into account the 
presence of these reactions. The shock and 
disbelief and misassessment of the situation 
are best dealt with by the availability of fac- 
tual information, and for this the media serve 
a very needed and appreciated role. The 
group negative reactions may be under-es- 
timated. Unless these are taken into ac- 
count, ventilated adequately, and addressed 
in specific ways when they generate inter- 
ferences, then appropriate interventions will 
be stalled. 

One would predict that in the long term, 
communities as groups would be sensitized to 
a trauma experienced previously and would 
retain some continuing anxiety about that 
sort of trauma. Communities generally seem 
to be restored to pre-crisis functioning rela- 
tively well; however, just as in individuals we 
know that crisis often is the occasion for 
human growth, similarly, communities in 
crisis might be thought of as seeking a resolu- 
tion level where new strengths are added 
rather than having the community return to 
the status quo. In this sense, it is particular- 
ly important to try to retain focus on what 
happens to the community initiatives which 
stall out after a crisis interval has passed. 

LESSONS FROM THE CLEAR 
LAKE EXPERIENCE 

In the immediate aftermath of the Clear 
Lake suicide cluster several research initia- 
tives were taken. These have continued al- 
though at present none is complete. Within 
Houston, a task force was e.stablished which 
outlined a series of studies which were 
deemed desirable. Funding was obtained im- 
mediately from the Texas Department of 
Mental Health and Mental Retardation. 
Subsequently, a research contract was 
negotiated with the U.S. Public Health Ser- 
vice for studying the families both in Clear 
Lake and in Piano, Texas where adolescent 
suicide clusters occurred. A data tape cover- 
ing 10 years of suicide experience throughout 



3-77 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



the State of Texas was obtained and funding 
is being sought for its analysis, with particular 
interest in correlating media coverage with 
suicide clusters. 

There is of course a high level of local inter- 
est in what has been learned about the 
specific situations in the Clear Lake suicides. 
General conclusions will be drawn from the 
analysis of data which we are editing. 
Preliminary observations indicate that the 
series of suicides seems to have occurred in 
individuals where the death was determined 
mainly on the basis of the individual stoiy of 
the adolescent. A search for connecting links 
revealed some interconnections among the 
individuals but nothing with the strength to 
explain why so many deaths occurred in so 
short a time. Similarly there has not been any 
identification of social factors in the Clear 
Lake area which could be thought of as 
responsible for the suicide cluster. It seems 
unreasonable to identify this as a toxic com- 
munity. Perhaps in the future, more detailed 
correlations between adolescent suicide 
clusters and the quality of community life will 
reveal important connections. 

One thing learned in the Clear Lake ex- 
perience is that in spite of the problems, a 
great deal of positive response was ac- 
complished in a remarkably short time. One 
special point that was raised in two of the 
public meetings was of interest and oc- 
casioned some alarm. Several individuals in 
Clear Lake were concerned with the stigma 
of mental illness in the family, not in terms of 
its effect on social status, but in terms of its 
effect on employment. There was remark- 
able assent in the audience when one in- 
dividual stated that having a suicidal 
adolescent might cost him his job. The per- 
ception in this group was that the employers, 
meaning government directly and govern- 
ment subcontractors, deal very unsym- 
pathetically with mental illness; families, 
therefore, are drxwa into a system of denial 
when things are v^Tong. 

Learning more about media impact on 
cluster suicides seems especially important 
because the siearch for influences on con- 




3-78 



tagion of suicide ideation focus naturally on 
the media Cluster suicides are being studied 
as a recent phenomenon. In fact, they have 
been reported for many decades and a few 
have been reported over several centuries. 
From the existing reports, it is clear that not 
all cluster suicides are the same and it would 
be wrong to make generalizations about 
media involvement in reporting these 
suicides. The cluster of suicides in Clear 
Lake must have been a very different 
phenomenon from the cluster of suicides, for 
example, which surrounded the publication 
and popularization of The Sorrows of Young 
Werther by Goethe (7). This fictional ac- 
count of a young man who died for love is said 
to have incited many young men to kill them- 
selves. A related phenomenon is seen when 
there is extensive media coverage of the 
death by suicide, or presumed suicide, of very 
well known figures, such as those of Marilyn 
Monroe, Janis Joplin, Freddy Prinz, and 
John Beiushi (8). Nothing of this sort was 
going on at the time of the Clear Lake 
suicides or at the time of the Piano suicides. 
In both instances, it is probably important to 
note that a well-loved member of the school 
population died a tragic accidental death. 
Since the media did not deal with the ac- 
cidental death, the media may be exonerated 
from any involvement in a grief-related con- 
tagion phenomenon. (The Clear Lake acci- 
dent received considerable media coverage 
after the suicide cluster and in connection 
with a campaign against drunk driving.) It 
remains an issue of concern that vulnerable, 
at-risk individuals may have their ideas about 
suicide made more concrete by the high level 
of attention paid to the deaths of school 
mates. Suggestion may play an important 
role in adolescent suicide, therefore, the 
media has a weighty responsibility both to 
report the news that needs to be reported, 
and if possible to guard against the 
phenomenon that that news can become 
suicidogenic. Since pubHc awareness of the 
death may be a specific goal of a suicide, there 
is no avoiding the bind placed on the medis. 
The best indirect solution is the conscien- 
tious effort on the part of reporters to deal

with the ambivalence felt by suicidal ■ 
dividuals, and to underscore alternatives 
available in the lives of people who are in 
emotional crisis. 

RECOMMENDATIONS 

A number of recommendations follow from 
the Clear Lake experience: 

1. A pre-developed plan for community 
Response to adolescent suicide clusters is 
needed. 

2. The crisis plan shouid cover much more 
than the mental health crisis of adolescent 
suicide. Every community would be wise 
to have such a plan for any crisis with men- 
tal health implications. Such a plan should 
be developed through existing community 
structures utilizing the available com- 
munity leadership, with a part of the plan 
defining ways in which others from outside 
the community can be useful. 

3. A great deal of attention can be ap- 
propriately devoted to public education. 
This education should prepare the public 
to expect difficult emotional tasks in the 
event of a crisis. Individuals should be 
prepared in advance to resist blaming and 
guilt and the whole range of problems as- 
sociated with stigmatization associated 
with a crisis. Specifically, with respect to 
adolescent suicide and family stigmatiza- 
tion associated with mental illness, public 
education should extend to employers to 
ameliorate the fears of employees that 
getting help might jeopardize their jobs. 

4. Media education is a major consideration. 
The importance of suggestion in cluster 
contagion is unknown; but many are con- 
cerned that the role of suggestion may be 
of major importance. Media personnel 
who, in the future, may cover issues of 
adolescent suicide, need to be trained in 
crisis pjiychology. They must recognize 
that when individuals are overwhelmed 
and may, indeed, be suicidal in the course 
of a crisis^ there is potential not only for 
healing, but for growth in such experien- 
ces. This more positive aspect needs to be 



Stressed during reporting. 

S. Adolescents need to be educated. The 
preparation of the population at risk is 
most critical. Adolescents are very 
responsive to preventive mental health in- 
itiatives. They are able to understand the 
importance of recognizing signs of trouble 
both in themselves and in their friends and 
they can be taught ways to seek and fmd 
help in the event of suicidal ideation.

SUMMARY 

This study describes current efforts in adoles- 
cent suicide prevention and intervention. 
Using mail questionnaires, a variety of 
programs that serve suicidal adolescents 
were surveyed: crisis telephone services, 
walk-in clinics, hospital-based emergency 
programs, mental health centers with crisis 
components, school-based suicide interven- 
tion programs, non-hospital-based crisis 
stabilization units, and others such as support 
groups for survivors of suicide, counseling 
agencies, and networks. 

This paper describes the methodology and 
analyzes the findings from 396 programs. 
Topics investigated include: visibility of 
programs, reasons for program start and age 
of program, funding sources, services, 
availability and linkage to other community 
' resources, client statistics, program problems 
and needs, community needs, and certifica- 
tion status. 

Services for suicidal adolescents are not 
centralized, but are found in numerous com- 
munity agencies with little networking 
among services. Many programs do not keep 
adequate records to assess service outcome 
and utilization by suicidal adolescents. 
Programs responding to the survey identified 



community education, school programs, staff 
and funding, specialized training regarding 
adolescent issues, and residential facilities as 
the program and community features most 
needed to serve suicidal adolescents better. 
Other major problems were the low visibility 
of programs, lack of certification and lack of 
written standards for suicide-related ser- 
vices. 

INTRODUCTION 

The research subcommittee of the Houston 
Task Force on Adolescent Suicide was asked 
by the Secretary's Task Force on Youth 
Suicide to identify and describe programs 
throughout the country which provide 
suicide-related services for youth. Our goal 
was to describe what is currently available for 
suicidal adolescents and to delineate 
programming gaps and problems. It was im- 
mediately obvious that services to suicidal 
adolescents were not necessarily found in 
programs neatly labeled as "adolescent 
suicide programs. ' Rather, services to 
suicidal adolescents were available through a 
variety of crisis intervention programs such 
as crisis telephones, walk-in crisis clinics, and 
emergency programs administered through

community mental health agencies. Other 
kinds of programs addressed adolescent 
suicide throu^ non-crisis services. These 
programs included school-based educational 
programs, grief support groups, and task for- 
ces that coordinated services for suicidal 
adolescents. 

Adolescent suicide is not an isolated event. 
Rather, it occurs in a social-psychological en- 
vironment in which elements that influence 
the environment, indirectly at least, affect 
suicidal behavior. Using thi& line of reason- 
ing, programs that seek to improve the self- 
esteem or problem-solving skills of 
adolescents are in some way primary preven- 
tion services. For the purpose of this survey, 
however, we limited the kinds of programs to 
those that would directly intervene with 
suicidal adolescents or were school-based 
educational^tervention programs. In short, 
we sought programs in which the prevention 
of, or intervention with, suicidal adolescents 
was a direct service goal. 

METHODOLOGY 

The project was conducted in two phases. 
The first was to identify programs to be in- 
cluded in the survey and the second was the 
fielding and analysis of the survey. 

Program Identification 

To identify programs for the survey, we first 
asked the 42 State mental health associations 
(MHAs) to provide us with directories of 
local MHAs. The local MHAs were, in turn, 
sent a project identification form asking them 
to identify and furnish addresses of programs 
that served suicidal adolescents in their com- 
munities. Although directories identified 
many community mental health centers, hot- 
lines, and crisis service, they did not cover 
the full range of programs in which we were 
interested. We also asked local community- 
resource people to identify programs in their 
communities that provided services to 
suicidal adolescents. As such, we were able 
to identify the programs on which local com- 
munities currently rely. 



We also sent the project identification form 
to 264 programs listed in the 1984 Directory 
of Information and Referral Services (I&R) 
in the U.S. and Canada. If two or more I&R 
services in a single community were found, 
one was randomfy selected to receive the 
project identification form. In cases of com- 
munity duplication between local MHA 
centers and I&R services, we sent the project 
identification form only to the I&R service; 
in large cities, we contacted both resources. 
One section of the project identification 
form asked respondents to identify others 
who could help us find the kinds of programs 
for which we were looking. These people, if 
in other communities, were sent thQ project 
identification form. A total of 523 forms 
were mailed. Five percent (n=24) were 
"returned to sender." Forty-six percent 
returned usable forms. Almost all listed at 
least one program; a few said their com- 
munities had no such services. 

Survey questionnaires were then sent to 
identified programs. They were also sent to 
all programs listed in the 1982 Directory of 
Suicide Prevention and Crisis Intervention 
Agencies (The American Association of 
Suicidology). Finally, a systematic random 
sample was drawn from the 1981 Directory of 
Federally Funded Community Mental 
Health Centers (DHHS). In all, 1,181 ques- 
tionnaires were mailed; 396 (34%) were 
returned in time to be included in this 
analysis. 

Community Characteristics 

A wide variety of communities were repre- 
sented in the survey. Thirty-seven percent of 
the programs were located in cities with 
populations of 100,000 or more, 41 percent of 
them were in cities with populations of 15,000 
to 100,000, and 16 percent were in cities with 
less than 25,000. Four percent were in the 
suburbs of large cities and 3 percent said they 
were located in two or more places 
throughout the county. 

The size of program catchment areas ranged 
from 1,000 to 8 million. Half the programs 
had catchment area populations of 235,000 



3-81 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



or less while 8 percent (n=31) had catchment 
areas of 1 million or more. 

Half of the programs were serving popula- 
tions with special characteristics. IVventy- 
four percent were in areas with unusual racial 
or ethnic distributions. Table 1, Distribution 
of Programs with Unusual Racial/Ethnic Dis- 
tributions, summarizes the distribution. As 
shown, catchment areas that had heavy con- 
centrations of whites, blacks, Hispanics, and 
multi-ethnicities were found in our sample. 

ISventy-seven of the catchment areas had 
large populations of young people while 
another 27 areas had large aged or retiree 
populations. Those with young populations 
were usually college towns. 

An unusual income distribution was the most 
often mentioned special characteristic of 
catchment populations. A full 14 percent 
(n=SS) of the programs were in areas of high 
poverty and/or unemployment. On the other 
hand, 13 programs reported high concentra- 
tions of wealthy people. Another 13 
programs said their populations had high 
concentrations of both wealthy and poor. 

Twenty-seven programs were in counties 
with *nilitary bases and six were in areas 
where the State or Federal Government was 
a large, employer. Many other programs 
were also in areas characterized by special oc- 
cupations. Six areas had either a paper mill 
or other single factory. Ten were in high 
technology areas. Twenty-nine were in 



predominantly mining, agricultural, gaming, 
lumber, or fishing areas, and 7 programs had 
to cope with high levels of tourism. Another 
12 programs responded with other special oc- 
cupational characteristics. Finally, 33 
programs served rural or geographically iso- 
lated populations. 

RESULTS 
Age of Program 

Suicide services were, for the most part, 
provided by well-established programs. 
Forty-one percent of the programs in the sur- 
vey began between 1970 and 1975, the years 
of the greatest program development Only 
25 percent (n=98) began in the 19805. Clear- 
ly, the recent resurgence of interest and con- 
cern in adolescent suicide has not sparked a 
rash of new programs. However, all of the 
programs specific for teen suicide began 
since 1980. 

It is interesting to note that 41 percent of the 
39 programs identified as having suicide com- 
ponents by their titles, began in 1970 or 
before. Even though many programs 
developed between IS)70 and 1975, their titles 
did not reveal a suicide-specific component. 
After 1970, seven years passed before 
another program in our sample, had such a 
title. Then, in 1984 and 1985 the remaining 16 
(41 percent of all programs with "suicide" in 
their titles) began. In short, during the 1970s 
when social programs were rapidly increas-

ing, suicide-specific programs were not 
forthcoming. Instead, more general 
programs that included suicide related ser- 
vices along with other crisis and non-crisis 
services were beginning. These programs es- 
tablished in the 1970s, are still the major 
providers of suicide services to adolescents. 

Program Visibility 

To whom does a suicidal adolescent turn? As 
anyone who has tried to Hnd a particular 
agency in the phone directory has ex- 
perienced, the title of an agency is usually 
needed in order to contact it. Because we 
were curious about how helpful titles were 
for "finding" a program, we analyzed program 
titles in terms of their key words. 

Incredibly few programs (n=8) had the 
words "teen," "youth," or "adolescent suicide" 
in their titles. Only 33 other programs (8%) 
had the word "teen" without the word 
"suicide." This is a critical shortcoming given 
that adolescents tend not to contact general 
services. Rather, as the child sexual abuse 
hotline in Knox County, Tennessee con- 
tended, adolescents are much more likely to 
contact a program that is advertised specifi- 
cally for them. Thus, much needs to be done 
to make programs more attractive to teens to 
encourage them to use these programs more 
frequently. 

Even titles containing the keyword "suicide" 
were not common. Only 31 (8%) programs 
fell into this category. Instead, program tit- 
les reflected an orientation to general 
problems, as opposed to specific ones, and to 
broad populations rather than special 
groups. 

A large number of programs had "crisis" or 
"emergency" in their title. Almost 1/4 (n=88) 
of the programs iiad "crisis" while 6 percent 
(n=24) had "emergency" in their titles. 
Another 39 programs (10%) were called 
Helpline, Hotline, or Hopeline. 

A relatively large number of programs (19%, 
n=75) were titled "mental health" or "coun- 
seling" programs. At least one program com- 
mented that the term "mental health" was 



seen as a stigma deterring teenage utilization. 

Finally, 32 programs (8%) were called 
"CONTACT and 66 programs (17 percent) 
had titles which did not convey crisis, emer- 
gency, suicide, or even helpline services. 
These programs had titles such as "Center for 
Human Services" and "Gateway." 

The visibility of a program is largely depend- 
ent on its advertising and 46 percent of the 
programs in the sample did not advertise to 
reach adolescents specifically. 

Reasons for Program Development 

Almost 40 percent of the programs in the 
sample began because of a particular interest 
in suicide services; in 11 percent of the cases, 
a specific suicide incident was the impetus. A 
few programs (2%), mentioned a high suicide 
rate in their communities. For 29 percent of 
the programs, however, issues other than 
suicide weie the reason for starting the 
program. These included: perceived need in 
community for general crisis services (22%), 
response to drug abuse (6%), and response 
to street youth (1%). The latter emerged not 
only to assist runaways, but also to address 
problems spawned by the deinstitutionaliza- 
tion of status offenders. (See Table 2, Dis- 
tribution of Reasons for Program 
Development.) 

Funding 

Because of differences among organizations, 
we were not able to obtain budget informa- 
tion solely for suicide components for all 
programs. Only75 programs (19%) reported 
the amount spent solely on suicide services, 
174 (44%) provided the amount tor aU crisis 
and referral services, and 45 (11%) provided 
a total agency budget that included more 
than crisis services. 

As shown in Table 3, Description of Program 
Funding by Budget TVpe, the average budget 
for a suicide component of an agency is 
$63,667. On the average, the 1986 budgets 
were $10,000 higher than for 1985. Betwet.i 
fiscal years 1984-85 and 1985-86, funding 



83 



3-83 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



devoted solely to suicide services increased 
proportionately higher than funding for both 
total crisis services and total agency services. 
The ratios of the average 198S-86 budget 
compared to the average 1984-85 budget was 
1.22. The corresponding ratio for total crisis 
budgets was 112 and for total agency budgets 
it was 1.06. 

Funding Sources 

Hie majority of programs did not receive 
federal funding, nor did they receive funding 
only from one source. Rather, they obtained 
funds from the State (58%) and a variety of 
local sources such as hindraising, donations, 
and United Way. When programs seek funds 
outside government sources (n^VfA) they 
look to fundraising (34%), United Way 
(27%), a combination of United Way and 



fundraising (16%), churches (4%), insurance 
and other third party payers (10%), and 
trainer/speaker fees (9%). 

Services 

The most prevalent service offered by 
programs was a crisis telephone, usually 
staffed 24-hours a day. Eighty-eight percent 
had this service component Usually, even if 
an agency did not provide a crisis telephone 
service, another agency in the community 
did. Only 2 programs stated that a crisis 
telephone service was not provided in their 
communities. More than 6 percent of the 
programs also offered a walk-ih crisis service 
while 6 percent said it was not available at all 

Education and public awareness were usual- 
ly provided by programs; very few com-

munities had no such service. In spite of the 
high proportion (8S%) of agencies par- 
ticipating in educational activities, half of 
them stated that their communities needed 
more education and awareness of suicide or 
better knowledge of resources. ( 

Grief coimseling, either face to face or via 
telephone, was available in most com- 
munities. Sixty-two percent of the programs 
offered the service, but only 12 programs 
specifically mentioned an SOS (Survivors of 
Suicide) group. Presumably, grief counsel- 
ing is still provided through more traditional 
formats such as individual and other group 
counseling. 

FoUowup therapy, including individual, 
group, or family was offered by less than half 
the programs in the survey sample. When 
crisis telephone programs were excluded 
from the data base, 70 percent of the remain- 
ing programs provided followup therapy. 
The rest reported that the service was avail- 
able elsewhere in their community. Only 3 
percent said it was not provided at all. 

Nine percent of the programs claimed that 
school intervention, in any form, was not 
available in their communities. Neither they 
nor another agency provided the service. 
More than half of the programs furnished 
some form of school-based intervention, 
whether personnel training, crisis interven- 
tion, or student awareness training, and in the 
remaining cases, another agency provided at 
least one of these services. Crisis interven- 
tion was the most likely service to be offered, 
followed by student awareness training and 
training school personnel. School-based in- 
tervention was regarded as an important ser- 
vice for adolescents. Indeed, when asked 
what more their programs needed for ade- 
quate service to suicidal adolescents, a full 
third responded "school programs." 

When another agency provided any of the 
above services, the program responding to 
the survey was unlikely to have any formal 
agreement with it. An agreement with a 
medical care facility was most common but 
only 21 percent of the programs had one. 



Eleven percent had an agreement with an 
agenqr providing followup therapy and 8 per- 
cent had one with a walk-in crisis clinic. 
Qearly, there is little formal networking in 
communities among agencies providing ser- 
vices to suicidal adolescents. 

Other Resources 

Respondents were also asked about the 
availability of, and their relationship to, other 
resources typically involved in suicidal inter- 
vention: private therapists, mental health 
programs, police, ambulance services, medi- 
cal emergency treatment, and psychiatric 
hospitalization. More than 25 percent of the 
programs reported that private therapists 
specifically interested in suicide were not 
available in their communities. Even when 
such therapists were available, only 6 percent 
of the programs had written transfer agree- 
ments with them and a few programs stated 
that it was program policy not to refer to 
private, for-profit, therapists. Linkage 
problems included: private therapists who 
would not accept clients who could not pay 
(n=10); insufficient number of private 
therapists (n=10); problematic client motiva- 
liion and follow-through with such referrals 
(n=3); clients having to wait too long for an 
appointment (n=l); and inadequate com- 
munication or linkage between the program 
and the therapist (n=5). Three more 
programs mentioned other problems such as 
clients lacking transportation to get to a 
therapist'^ office. 

Only 8 of the 396 programs claimed their 
communities had no mental health program. 
Twenty percent of the programs in the 
sample were, themselves, the mental health 
program. Of the remaining 316 programs, 41 
percent had written transfer agreements with 
the mental health program in their com- 
munity. The most frequent (n=17) com- 
plaint regarding linkage was the long waiting 
time before clients could be seen-up to six 
weeks in one case. Other problems included: 
clients unable to pay; a lack of after-hours 
crisis intervention care or outreach; com- 
munication problems between the mental

Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



health program and the responding program 
regarding aftercare following crisis or 
hospitalization; and difficulty with client 
motivation and referral compliance* Several 
programs mentioned treatment barriers 
specific to adolescents, namely, the need to 
get parental consent or an agency policy not 
to serve anyone under 17 years old. 

In a few communities (n=7) ambulance ser- 
vices were not available. For the vast 
majority of the remaining programs, getting 
to a helping resource was the client^s respon- 
sibility, even when in crisis. Eighty-one per- 
cent of the programs had no formal 
agreement with an ambulance service. Four 
percent of the sample reported that clients in 
crisis also faced other problems with am- 
bulance services. Ambulances were reluc- 
tant to transport if they were unsure of 
reimbursement, and in some communities, 
they responded only to medical needs. Thus, 
if a client was suicidal but had not yet at- 
tempted, ambulances would not transport 
that person to a crisis intervention facility. 

The programs in our sample were unlikely to 
have formalized agreements with police- 
only 13 percent did. The programs were even 
more critical of police than th^ were of am- 
bulance services. Seven programs men- 
tioned that police lacked 
suicide-intervention training and/or were 
reluctant to accept such training. Nine 
programs complained about the lack of 
police response to crises situations. One 
program mentioned that police were disil- 
lusioned about crisis intervention because of 
the State's deinstitutionalization laws. Other 
programs referred to the failure of police to 
use appropriate community resources and to 
operational problems such as difficulty in 
tracing calls. Another 5 percent of the 
sample acknowledged problems but did not 
specify what they were. 

Less than one quarter of the programs had 
written agreements with hospital emergency 
medical care resources. Among the 353 
programs with valid data, 9 percent had 
linkage problems with these resources. The 
most frequent problems mentioned involved 




3-86 



the actual referral process: the lack of clear 
guidelines for referral; the lack of a central- 
ized reporting mechanism; being able to 
refer only with police intervention; and the 
unwillingness of medical care resources to 
handle clients with psychiatric problems, 
even when there were medical problems. 
For several programs, the lack of appropriate 
psychiatric staff within the medical care 
facility was a refenal barrier. 

Hospital psychiatric admission was available 
to 92 percent of the programs in the sample. 
Moreover, it was the resource with which 
programs were most likely to have written 
transfer agreements (36% of the 342 
programs who furnished complete data). It 
is with this resource, however, that the 
programs in the sample also experienced the 
most problems. The lack of beds was fre- 
quently mentioned (n=18). Other programs 
referred to problems with the admission 
process, such as delayed admission, disagree- 
ment as to the appropriateness of certain 
referrals, refused admission to those who 
could not pay, and refused admission to 
clients with medical problems. Distance to 
nearest facility and other transportation is- 
sues posed complications for twelve 
programs. For some communities, the 
nearest facility, while available, was SO to 100 
miles away. Getting a client to these facilities 
was a problem, particularly for indigent 
clients lacking personal transportation. 

Program Outcome Data 

One section of the questionnaire asked for 
program outcome data, specifically: number 
of clients directly served in the past fiscal 
year; number of suicide-related clients and 
how many of these were adolescent; number 
of suicide-related clients who return to crisis 
within a year; and the number of documented 
client deaths. In responding to the question 
on number of suicidal clients, programs in- 
cluded not just attempters but also clients 
with suicidal thoughts and ideation. 

Five percent of the programs could not give 
the number of clients served last year. Some 
programs, particularly the crisis telephone

J.Simmons: Prevention/Intervention Programs. . . 



programs, did not have records on the num- 
ber of individual clients; their data reflected 
the total number of contacts. Thus, the data 
for crisis telephone programs reflected the 
number of calls although some clients called 
repeatedly. Even among similar programs, 
there is wide variation in the number of 
clients or client contacts. One telephone 
crisis program reported more than 103,000 
calls; another had less than 2,000. One 
school-based program intervened in 8 cases; 
another intervened in SO cases. The extreme 
variation among programs and between 
program types made any further generaliza- 
tion regarding total number of clients inap- 
propriate. 

The most striking observation about other 
outcome data was that programs frequently 
did not gather this kind of information. 
Twenty seven percent of the programs stated 
th^ were unable to give the number of 
suidde-related cases or simply left the ques- 
tion blank. Information on the number of 
adolescent suicide-related cases was even 
less frequently available. Forty-five percent 



of the programs did not respond. Forty-two 
percent did not know how many suicidal 
clients returned in crisis within the year and 
another 22 percent left the question blank. 
Twenty-one percent of the programs did.not 
know the number of documented client 
deaths from suicide last year while 18 percent 
did not answer at all. 

Our analysis of outcome data included only 
those programs for which data were avail- 
able. For a few, suicide-related cases oc- 
curred infrequently. Seven percent of the 
programs had ten or less such cases last year. 
Most programs (63%), however, handled 100 
or more suicide-related clients. Among the 
291 programs for which data was available, 12 
percent had 1,500 or more suicidal con- 
tacts/clients. (See Table 4 for the distribu- 
tion). Overall, 7 percent of all clients served 
were suicidal. The number of suicidal adoles- 
cents that programs served also varied wide- 
ly not only between types of programs but 
also among similar programs. Some 
programs served no suicidal adolescents last 
year while others served more than 600.

Across all programs in the sample, 13 percent 
of the suicide-related clients were adoles- 
cents. 

Table 5 presents the distribution of the num- 
ber of documented suicides among clients. 
Very few of each program's clientele actual- 
ly committed suicide. More than half (59%) 
of the programs that furnished data reported 
no client deaths from suicide last year. Thir- 
teen percent had only 1 client suicide and 18 
percent had two or three. The remaining 14 
percent had four or more. Ovc:a% there 
were 297 suicides per 100,000 suicide-related 
clients served. 

Problems 

Using a combination of closed and open- 
ended questions, we asked respondents to 
identify specific program problems, especial- 
ly those that affected service delivery to 
suicidal adolescents. We also asked respon- 
dents what more their communities needed 
for adequate services to this special popula- 



tion. Table 6 presents the distribution of the 
responses to dose-ended questions. 

Staffing and Profeaalonal isauea 

Staff shortage was the major complaint of 54 
percent of the programs. This problem was 
reiterated when respondents were asked 
what more their programs needed for ade- 
quate service. Twenty seven percent again 
replied "staff and money." 

Not only the number but the quality of staff 
was of some concern. Of all persons 
employed by the programs in the sample, 
more than half (57%) were volunteers. 
When crisis telephone programs are ex- 
cluded from the analysis, 33 percent of all 
employees are volunteers. Problems with 
troubled volunteers was not a major issue but 
10 percent of respondents stated that their 
staff needed more training, particularly 
regarding adolescent issues. 

More than a third of the respondents claimed

that various staff and professional issues 
hampered their ability to serve suicidal 
adolescents. In addition to more staff and 
training, th^ wanted more time to work with 
adolescents and better networking with 
other professionals. Similar concerns were 
stated regarding community needs: better 
networking and case followup, better trained 
professionals, more professional resources in 
general, and more professional commitment 
to the problem. 



objection was the belief that talking about 
suicide would give teenagers Vrong ideas." 
Some programs also suggested that school 
personnel be trained regarding indices and 
intervention techniques. Not only the lack of 
qualified school personnel, but also the 
availability of school staff to teenagers, were 
problems. Often, school counselors were 
tied up with helping students schedule cour- 
ses and had little time to talk with troubled 
students. 



Community Education 

Programs wanted to do more community 
education activities but were hampered by 
the lack of funds and staff. In fact, 20 percent 
of them said this was a major need in their 
communities. Their concern particularly 
centered around the need for greater recog- 
nition and awareness that teen suicide exists 
and is a viable problem. 

School Programs 

Respondents considered schools to be criti- 
cal intervention arenas. Many programs 
were already doing some form of school in- 
tervention; 11 percent thought this was what 
their programs should be doing but were not, 
and 16 percent replied that this was a major 
community need. In many communities, 
school systems were reluctant to have 
suicide-specific educational programs. One 



Specific Adolescent Programs 

Sixteen percent of respondents listed specific 
adolescent services which they believed 
would enhance their program's effectiveness 
in serving suicidal adolescents. Those most 
often mentioned, in order of frequency, in- 
cluded: residential/in-patient treatment sup- 
port groups for both attempters and survivors 
of victims, safe-houses and other non-hospi- 
tal residential services, peer counseling, and 
family involvement in treatment. 

Many of these services were listed again 
under additional services communities 
needed to serve suicidal adolescents ade- 
quately. Almost 25 percent of respondents 
listed services specially attuned to adolescent 
needs such as: in-patient beds and residen- 
tial facilities, teen community centers and 
drop-in clinics, peer counseling, prevention 
programs, support groups, and long-term,

family-oriented treatment. Another concern 
was the need for more leverage to work with 
adolescents when parents refused counseling 
or help for their adolescents or when adoles- 
cents needed to be separated from the 
parent. 

Certification Standards and 
Qualifications 

The certification of programs and qualifica- 
tions of professionals is of some concern. 
Only 9 percent of the programs with valid 
data (n =367) were certiHed by the American 
Association of Suicidology and one quarter 
of the programs (26%) did not have written 
standards for suicide-related procec^ures. 

Twenty nine percent of all professional staff 
working directly with clients (i.e., excluding 
volunteers, administrative, coordinative, and 
secretarial staff) had undergraduate degrees 
or less. The lack of advanced education 
coupled with programs' own requests for 
staff better trained in adolescent issues sug- 
gests that attention be given to the qualifica- 
tions of persons who are working with 
suicidal adolescents. 

A similar concern was repeated regarding 
"helping" individuals outside a program's 
auspices. Several respondents expressed dis- 
may that self-proclaimed "experts" in suicide 
may do more harm than good. They gave 
sr»ecific examples of trainers and other per- 
sons who were obviously uninformed and un- 
prepared to deal with suicide. Illinois is one 
State that is attempting to establish certifica- 
tion standards for individuals as well as for 
programs. 

Suicide-Specific Programs: A 
Subanalysis 

From the first 271 questionnaires returned, 
we analyzed separately 27 interven- 
tion/prevention programs exclusively or 
predominantly devoted to suicide, as deter- 
mined by their titles. None were located in 
small towns of populations under 15,000, but 
neither were they solely a product of dense- 
ly populated areas. They were as likely to be 



found in cities of 15,000 to 100,000 as in larger 
ones. As reasons for program development, 
most listed professional interest in suicide 
(70%) followed by a specific suicide incident 
(37%). Only 11 percent listed "response to 
high suicide rate." 

These programs were not overwhelmingly 
multi-service agencies. No more than 60 per- 
cent had a crisis telephone service and only 
15 percent had a walk-in crisis service. The; 
most common activity was education and 
public awareness (93%), followed by student 
awareness (67%), and direct crisis interven- 
tion in the school (63%). These agencies 
usually did not offer followup therapy-only 
22 percent did-and when it was offered, it 
was most likely to be individual therapy, not 
family or group. 

Even these specialized groups were not for- 
mally linked to (i.e., have written agreements 
with) other traditional resources in the com- 
munity such as police, ambulance services, 
and private therapists. The resourc-** most 
often linked with the suicide-related 
program was a mental health program. One 
quarter (26%) of the programs had written 
agreements with a mental health agency and 
reported no problems in working with this 
resource. On the other hand, while only 11 
percent had written agreements with hospi- 
tal psychiatric resources, almost a fourth 
reported problems, particularly, too few 
beds, and clients being refused admission for 
financial and other reasons. 

Funding for these programs came primarily 
from the State, United Way, and dona- 
tions/fundraising. Budgets were not large. 
Thirty percent of the programs operated on 
$7,000 or less. Another third had budgets be- 
tween $29,000 and $100,000. Only one 
program had a budget greater than $250,000. 

The programs varied greatly in the number 
of clients served. One reported 30, while 
several reported more than 25,000. It was 
not surprising that among these programs, 
suicidal clients comprised a larger proportion 
of all clients served than among other 
programs (13% vs. 7%). 

95 



3-90 



J.Simmons: Prevention/Intervention Programs. . . 



On the other hand, suicide-specific programs 
did not attract adolescents as well as the 
other programs. Only 7 percent of all suicidal 
clients were adolescents compared to 12 per- 
cent for the entire sample. The client death- 
rate, however, is smaller-245 vs. 304 per 
100,000 suicidal cliente. 

Twenty-two percent of these programs listed 
more community education and school 
programs as needed components to their ser- 
vices. More training, more funding, or more 
time to work with adolescents were program 
needs for more than half the sample. Vety 
few (n -3) wished to add a speciHc adolescent 
service to their program, but 25 percent did 
want to have such services developed within 
their communities. 

These programs were more likely than other 
programs to advertise specifically to adoles- 
cents (70% vs. 43%). Still, 22 percent of 
them did not. Also, more than 80 percent of 
them were not certified by the American As- 
sociation of Suicidology and 22 percent did 
not have written standards for suicide-re- 
lated procedures. 

DISCUSSION 

Suicide prevention/intervention services for 
adolescents are generally not provided by 
agencies established solely for that purpose. 
Specializing in suicidal adolescents is the ex- 
ception rather than the rule. Services are 
usually available through general crisis 
programs, with suicide being just one type of 
crisis handled. Yet, there seems to be a grow- 
ing recognition that working with adolescent 
suicide requires a level of staff expertise that 
is currently lacking. Many of the programs in 
the sample want more staff training and indi- 
cated a need for staff trained in adolescent 
development and issues. They see this as a 
need not only for their own programs but also 
for other programs in their communities. For 
example, a respondent for a crisis telephone 
program indicated the need for the mental 
health clinic in the community to have a 
specialist in adolescence. 

Most communities included in our sample 



have not addressed adolescent suicide as a 
separate issue. Agencies, or even programs 
within agencies, do not specialize in suicide. 
For many communities the lack of specializa- 
tion is partly fostered by the belief that 
adolescent suicide is not a problem or does 
not exist and surv^ respondents often ex- 
pressed dismay over the extent of community 
unawareness. Program personnel consider 
community education as a priority issue in im- 
proving service to suicidal adolescents. 

Addressing adolescent suicide as a separate 
issue is difficult because it is often accom- 
panied by a wide variety of other problems 
such as drug and alcohol abuse, depression, 
family conflict, running away, and even 
Satanic worship. Q<»,arly, for a community to 
develop a comprehensive service system for 
suicidal adolescents, it must be able to hand- 
le these other problems as well. In many 
communities it is not the lack of services for 
accompanying problems that lessens effec- 
tive interaction but, rather, the lack of net- 
working among programs in a community. 
The absence of networking was felt on two 
levels: case coordination and service 
delivery. We found instances of ambulances 
refusing to transport patients if there were no 
physical injury, psychiatric wards refusing to 
admit if there were physical Injuries, and 
medical programs reluctant to treat if there 
were psychiatric/ psychological problems. 
Perhaps community coordination by some- 
one trained in adolescent issues would en- 
courage these programs to be receptive to 
adolescents in crisis. 

To serve suicidal adolescents better, survey 
respondents recommend a combination of 
strengthening services already in operation 
through funding, staffing, training, and net- 
working as well as the development of teen- 
specialized services such as teen community 
centers, pee*" ^''cling, and safehouscs. 
Still, the existence ot a service does not mean 
that teenagers will automatically use it. 
Several mental health agencies specifically 
mentioned that teenagers vvsrc unlikely to 
use their services. Current programs need to 
consider factors affecting service utilizatic n

Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



by teenagers and to make special efforts to 
advertise their programs directly to this 
population. 

The issue of allowing suicide preven- 
tion/education programs in schools remains 
unsettled. Respondents felt that these 
programs are important for reaching adoles- 
cents adequately, yet many school systems 
oppose such efforts. Some programs have 
developed school intervention curricula, are 
training students and personnel, and are 
providing crisis intervention. Other 
programs and schools might benefit by ob- 
serving the strategies in schools in which 
programs are already developed. 

Parents, too, are sometimes obstacles to 
helping suicidal adolescents. Several 
programs have problems in obtaining paren- 
tal permission to counsel adolescents. To 
strengthen the accessibility of services by 
adolescents, changes in consent laws must be 
addressed. The problem is compounded 
when parents themselves, are primary con- 
tributing factors to a troubled adolescent. 
Respondents to the survey urged com- 
munities not wishing to provide a com- 
prehensive system of service, to provide for 
separation of parent and adolescent and to 
find alternative ways to involve parents in 
treatment. 

Another dilemma that must be addressed in 
serving suicidal adolescents is the availability 
of residential treatment beds, when needed. 
In many communities, the need for such beds 
is relatively infrequent so that none are 
reserved for such emergencies. Thus, a 
suicidal adolescent may need inpatient treat- 
ment when a bed is not available. Survey 
respondents recommend that such beds be 
established and held in reserve, to be used 
M'hen needed, regardless of frequency of use. 
The same concern was stated in a somewhat 
different form when one program director 
wrote that, on the basis of prevalence, other 
mental health problems such as 
schizophrenia took staffing and funding 
priority over adolescent suicide. In short, 
decision makers will have to examine 
priorities and prevalence issues when debat- 



ing program development for adolescent 
suicide services at the community level. 

The lack of certain services for adolescents, 
particularly in-patient/residential treatment 
space, must be addressed if a more effective 
system for serving suicidal adolescents is to 
be established. These developments will 
probably take money; certainly, they will re- 
quire agency policy changes. Professionals in 
communities do not have to wait, however, 
for such major problems to be resolved. 
Many services are already available and their 
coordination would be a beginning of an im- 
proved delivery system for suicidal adoles- 
cents.

SUMMARY 

This paper reports the results of a survey of 
395 suicide prevention/ intervention 
programs in the United States. Included in 
the sample are 152 crisis telephone services, 
9 walk-in clinics, 24 hospital-based emergen- 
cy programs, 142 mental health centers with 
a crisis component, 17 school-based suicide 
intervention programs, 8 non-hospital-based 
crisis stabilization units, 22 combinations of 
two of the above, and 21 other programs such 
as survivors of suicide, counseling agencies, 
and networks. Crisis telephone services and 
mental health clinics make up 74 percent of 
the organizations that responded to the sur- 
vey. 

Each type of program is described in terms of 
location, special characteristics of the catch- 
ment population, services provided, number 
of clients served, number of suicide-related 
cases served, number of suicide-related 
adolescent cases served, number of docu- 
mented suicides, available resources, 
budgets, funding sources, and problems en- 
countered by the programs. 



Most of the programs were developed in 
response to professional interest in suicide 
services. Although program labels were 
often misleading, a surprisingly large number 
of programs offered cx)mprehensive services 
directed toward suicide prevention^nterven- 
tion. The services most often offered were 
education and public awareness efforts, and 
crisis telephones. Medical care for suicide at- 
tempters was least likely to be provided. 

Budgets ranged from under $20,000 to well 
over $1,000,000 and almost all programs 
reported multiple funding sources. Staff 
shortages, funding deficiencies and the in- 
stability of funding were problems en- 
countered most often by the 395 programs in 
our survey. Other than more funds and more 
staff, most programs had the resources they 
need to serve suicidal adolescents in the com- 
munity. 

The average number of suicide-related 
adolescents served last year by programs in 
our survey was 76, ranging from 26 served by 
school-based intervention programs to 375 



3-93 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



suicide-related adolescents served by mental 
health centers. The highest rate of suicide 
per 1,000 suicide-related clients was 38.2 in 
school-based intervention programs and the 
lowest was in non-hospital-based programs 
with .29. 

INTRODUCTION 

While the community response to the in- 
creasing rates of adolescent suicide is 
thought to be massive, very little is known 
about the actual programs that have 
developed, where they are located, why th^ 
began, what services they offer, what resour- 
ces are available to them, what their annual 
budgets and funding sources are, how many 
clients they serve, and what their problems 
are. 

To address these issues, we first asked the 
local programs of the Mental Health As- 
sociation and the programs listed in the 1984 
Directory of Information and Referral 
Programs in the United States and Canada to 
identify suicide prevention/intervention 
programs known to them. All programs 
listed in the Directory of the American As- 
sociation of Suicidology and a random selec- 
tion from the 1981 Directory of Community 
Mental Health Centers in the United States 
were added for a total of 1,181 programs. 
Methodological details of the survey are dis- 
cussed elsewhere (Simmons, Comstock, and 



Franklin). This paper describes the 395 
programs which returned usable survey 
forms to us. 

PROGRAM CHARACTERISTICS 

Table 1 summarizes the types of suicide 
prevention^ntervention programs respond- 
ing to the survey. Of the 395 programs, 38 
percent (152) describe themselves as crisis 
telephone services, 2 percent (9) as walk-in 
crisis clinics; 6 percent (24) as hospital-based 
emergency programs; 36 percent (142) as 
mental health centers with a crisis com- 
ponent which includes suicide intervention; 
4 percent (17) as school-based suicide inter- 
vention programs; and 2 percent (8) as non- 
hospital-based crisis stabilization units, 
city-sponsored community crisis services, 
general intervention services or comprehen- 
sive general crisis agencies. Six percent (22) 
of the programs are combinations of two of 
the programs listed above and 5 percent (21) 
of the programs describe themselves as sur- 
vivors of suicide, community mental health 
clinics with no emergency service, com- 
munity-based education and support groups, 
counseling agencies and networks. For dis- 
cussion purposes, these programs are labeled 
Other.

as geographic isolation, which make their 
catchment population unusual. 

Walk-in clinics were the most likely to con-, 
sider their population unusual (67%), close- 
ly followed by mental health centers (66%), 
hospital- based emergency services (63%), 
non-hospital-based programs (56%), com- 
binations (50%), crisis telephone services 
(44%), school-based intervention programs 
(35%;, and other programs (33%).

Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



Initiation of Program 

Table 4 summarizes the reasons for estab- 
lishing the service programs surveyed. 
Eleven percent of the 395 programs began in 
response to a specific suicide incident. But 
the most often listed reasons for developing 
programs were professional interest in 
suicide services with no specific incident 
(37%), federal mandate for community men- 
tal health center emergency component 
(26%), and perceived need in the community 
for general services (24%). 

Services 

Programs were asked to list their services in 
terms of those directly provided, those 
provided by another agency under foimal 
agreement with the reporting agency, those 
provided by another agency in the com- 
munity with no formal ties to the reporting 
agency, and those services not provided in 
the community. 

A surprisingly large number of agencies 
provide a wide range of suicide preven- 
tion/intervention services. Community men- 
tal health centers are the. most 
comprehensive: 90 percent provide crisis 
telephone services, 96 percent provide walk- 
in clinics, 90 percent provide grief counsel- 
ing, and 96 percent provide family emergency 
therapy. TTiey provide foUowup therapy for 



individuals (93%), groups (83%), and 
families (92%). Eighty-eight percent 
provide education and public awareness ser- 
vices and 70 percent provide school interven- 
tion services, including personnel training 
(54%), crisis intervention (75%), and stu- 
dent awareness training (46%). 

Crisis telephone services provide the client 
with a wider range of services than expected. 
Twenty-three percent of the 152 crisis 
telephone services provide walk-in crisis ser- 
vices, 2 percent provide medical care for 
suicide attempters, 40 percent provide grief 
counseling, 12 percent provide family emer- 
gency therapy and followup therapy, 83 per- 
cent provide education/public awareness 
services and 44 percent provide school inter- 
vention services, including training person- 
nel for school intervention (45%), providing 
crisis intervention to schools (41%), and 
providing awareness training for students 
(53%). 

All walk-in crisis clinics provide direct crisis 
telephone services and family emergency 
therapy. Most provide education/public 
awareness services (89%), intervention for 
schools (67%), and grief counseling (67%). 
Forty-four percent of the walk-in crisis clinics 
also provide direct training for school inter- 
vention and (33%) student awareness train- 
ing.

J.Franklln:CharacterlstlC8 of Suicide Prevention... 



Hospital-based emergency services tend to 
be comprehensive in that they provide crisis 
telephone services (79%); walk-in crisis ser- 
vices (79%); medical care for suicide at- 
tempters (42%); grief counseling (63%); 
family emergency therapy (96%); followup 
therapy (71%) to individuals (67%), groups 
(54%), and families (67%); education/public 
awareness services (75%); and school inter- 
vention services (63%), including personnel 
training (50%), crisis intervention (50%), 
and student awareness training (46%). 

Only 2 (12%) of the school-based interven- 
tion programs provide crisis telephone ser- 
vices and none provide medical care for the 
suicide attempters. But they do provide 
walk-in crisis services (47%); grief counseling 
(53%); family emergency therapy (29%); fol- 
lowup therapy (29%) to individuals (47%), 
groups (29%), and families (24%); educa- 
tion/public awareness services (94%); and 
schooi intervention services (88%) "ncluding 
training (88%), crisis intervention (76%), 
and .student awareness training (100%). 

The non-hospital-based programs provide 
crisis telephone services (100%); walk-ii 
crisis services (89%); grief counseling (44%); 
family emergency services (78%); followup 
therapy (33%) for individuals (33%), group 
(22%), and families (44%); education/public 
awareness services (78%) and school inter- 
vention services (67%) which includes per- 
sonnel training (56%), crisis intervention 
(67%), and student awareness training 
(44%). 

All combination programs provide crisis 
telephone services (100%); and some 
provide walk-in crisis services (82%); grief 
counseling (59%); family emergency tlierapy 
(41%); followup therapy (36%) to in- 
dividuals (32%), groups (23%), and families 
(23%); education/public awareness services 
(91%); and school intervention (73%) which 
includes persoimel training (68%), crisis in- 
tervention (68%), and student awareness 
training (86%). 

Programs in the "other" category provide 
crisis telephone services (43%); walk-in 



clinic services (52%); medical care for suicide 
attempts (5%); grief counseling (48%); fami- 
ly emergency therapy (41%); followup 
therapy (52%) to individuals (52%), groups 
(43%), and families (52%); education/public 
awareness services (81%); and school inter- 
vention (62%) which includes personnel 
training (67%), crisis intervention (52%), 
and student awareness training (57%). 

As indicated by these statistics, programs do 
not differ greatly in terms of services that they 
provide directly to cUents. 

Of the services provided by the 395 programs, 
medical care for suicide attempters is the 
least likely, provided by only 7 percent of the 
programs (2% of the crisis telephone ser- 
vices, 42% of the hospital-based emergency 
clinics, 10% of the community mental health 
centers, and 5% of the programs in the 
"other" category). However, an additional 21 
percent provide medical care for suicide at- 
tempters by formal agreement with another 
agency and more than half (54%) report that 
these services are provided by another agen- 
cy which has no formal ties to the reporting 
program. 

Community Resources 

Programs report very few defici'jncies with 
community resources. Private therapists 
who are interested in suicide are available to 
69 percent of the programs; only 7 percent 
have written agreements with private 
therapists and only 9 percent report 
problems making referrals. Some of the 
problems associated with referrals include 
the client's inability to pay and therapists not 
being available at off hours. 

Mental lealth services are available to 96 
percent of the programs and 33 percent have 
written agreements which allow clients to be 
tr?nsferred between the reporting program 
and the mental health service. Eleven per- 
cent report problems linking clients with 
mental health services; the most often cited 
problems are long waiting lists and lack of 
staff at the mental health facility. 

Almost all (%%) of the programs have an 



3-97 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



ambulance service available to them. Only 9 
percent have written agreements with am- 
bulance services and on'y 4 percent report 
problems. Police are also available to most 
(97%) programs; 13 percent have written 
agreements with police and 10 percent 
report problems working with police, mostly 
due to lack of police training in the area of 
suicide. 

Hospital emergency medical care is available 
to 97 percent of the 395 programs, 23 percent 
have written agreements and only 8 percent 
report problems linking clients to this 
resource. Ninety-two percent of the 
programs have psychiatric hospital services 
as an available resource and 36 percent have 
written agreements with a psychiatric facility. 
However, 19 percent of the programs report 
problems linking clients with a psychiatric 
facility such as insufficient number of beds, 
delays in admission, and reimbursement is- 
sues. 

Availability of community resources is not re- 
lated to program type and other than a 
general shortage of private therapists who 
are interested in suicide and who are avail- 
able to the program, few programs report 
problems with the availability of resources. 

Costs 

Budget Breakdown 

Ninety (23%) of the programs did not report 
budgets. Of the 3G5 that reported budgets, 
21 percent have annual budgets of $20,000 or 
less, while 8 percent report budgets of more 
than 1 million dollars for fiscal years 1985- 
1986. 

Crisis telephone services reported annual 
bud;,'ets of $20,000 or less (21%); $21,000 to 
$50,000 (29%); $51,000 to $75,000 (15%); 
$76,000 to $100,000 (10%); and $101,000 to 
$500,000 (24%). One program reported a 
budget of $501 ,000 to $1 ,000,000 and 1 1 per- 
cent of the crisis telephone service prograirs 
did not report budget information for fiscal 
year 1985-86. 

Walk-in crisis clinics report annual budgets 



3-98 



of $21,000 to $50,000 (38%); $51,000 to 
$75,000 (13%); $76,000 to $100,000 (25%); 
$101,000 to $500,000 (13%); and $501,000 to 
$1,000,000 (13%). Eleven percent did not 
report budgets. One hospital-based emer- 
gency services program has a budget of 
$79,000, two have budgets of $200,000 and 
$335,000, one reports $523,000 and another 
reports $600,000. Seven percent have 
budgets of $501,000 to $1,000,000 and 21 
percent report budgets in excess of 1 million 
dollars. Four (21%) programs did not report 
budget data. 

Mental health centers report budgets in each 
of the seven categories: $20,000 or less 
(17%); $21,000 to $50,000 (9%); $51,000 to 
$75,000 (6%); $76,000 to $100,000 (4%); 
$101,000 to $500,000 (35%); $501,000 to 
$1,000,000 (7%); and more than $1,000,000 
(18%). Thirty percent did not report budget 
data. 

The school-based intervention programs are 
smaii-ail but one (with a $220,000 budget) 
report annual budgets of $20,000 or less 
(41% did not report). Non-hospital-based 
emergency programs range from $76,000 to 
$100,000 (20%); $101,000 to $500,000 
(60%); and $501,000 to $1,000,000 (20%) 
(56% did not report). Combination 
programs report budgets of $20,000 or less 
(11%); $21,000 to $50,000 (17%); $51,000 to 
$75,000 (6%); $76,000 to $100,000 (17%); 
$101,000 to $500,000 (44%); and over 
$1,000,000 (6%). Eight percent did not 
report budget data. Annual budgets of 
"other" programs include $20,000 or less 
(35%); $21,000 to $50,000 (18%); $51,000 to 
$75,000 (18%); $101,000 to $500,000 (6%); 
$501,000 to $1,000,000 (12%); and over 
$1,000,000(12%). Nineteen percent did not 
report. 

F unding Sources 

Multiple funding sources characterize the 
395 programs, ^he most often mentioned 
funding source was from local sources (66%), 
followed by State (58%), client fees (35%), 
federal (25%), and foundations (17%). 

Crisis telephone services receive funding

often by mental health centers. Funding 
sources of mer tal health centers include 
State (82%), local (71%), client fees (69%), 
federal (34%), and foundations (6%). 

School-based intervention programs report

SERVICE DATA 

In this section each program type is described 
in terms of: 

• Number of clients served in the last fiscal 
year. 

• Number of clients who were suicide-re- 
lated. 

• Number of the suicide-zelated cases who 
were adolescents. 

• Number of suicide-related clients who 
returned in crisis within a year. 

• Number of documented client deaths 
from suicide. 



• Suicide rate per 1,000 suicide-related 
cases. 

Although 395 programs returned usable sur- 
veys, only 287 reported both the number of 
clients served and the number of suicide- 
related clients served in the past fiscal year. 
Only 215 programs reported both fhe num- 
ber of suicide- related clients and the number 
of adolescent suicide-related clients; and 147 
programs reported both the number of 
suicide-related clients and the number of 
suicide-related clients that returned within a 
year. More than half"211 programs- 
reported both the number of suicide-related 
cases served last fiscal year and the number 
of documented client deaths from suicide last 
year. The percentages and rates in the fol- 
lowing discussion are conservative and, in all 
cases would be the same or larger if we in- 
cluded only programs that reported all data 
elements. Table 5 summarizes the data 
presented in the following section. 

Crisis telephone services report serving 
1,682,703 contacts during the past fiscal year. 
Six percent of the clients were suicide-related 
and 8 percent of the suicide-related contacts 
were adolescents. Only 5 percent of the 
suicide-related clients returned in crisis 
within a year and 137 deaths from suicide 
were documented during the last year. The 
rate of documented suicides was 1.3 per 1,000 
suicide-related contact 

Walk-in clinics report^ serving 18,059 
clients during the last fiscal year. Eleven per- 
cent were suicide-related and 8 percent of 
the suicide-related cases were adolescents. 
About 20 percent of the suicide-related 
clients returned in crisis within a year and 9 
of the suicide-related clients died from 
suicide last year. The rate of documented 
suicide was 4.7 per 1,000 suicide-related 
clients served. 

Hospital-based emergency programs 
reported ser\'ing 81,372 clients in the past fis- 
cal year. About 19 percent were suicide- 
related and 13 percent of the suicide-related 
cases were adolescents. Two percent of the 
suicide-related cases returned in crisis within

ayear. Thirty-three deaths from suicide were 
documented during the year for a rate of 2.1 
suicides per 1,000 suicide-relate i clients ser- 
ved. 

Mental health centers reported serving 
306,596 clients during the past fiscal year. 
Eight percent of the clients were suicide- 
related cases and 2 percent of the suicide- 
related cases were adolescents. About 12 
percent of the suicide-related cases returned 
in crisis within a year and 143 suicides were 
recorded during the past year. The suicide 
rate was 5.9 per 1,000 suicide-related clients 
served. 

School-based intervention programs 
reported serving 11,152 clients during the 
past fiscal year. One percent of those served 
were suicide-related and all of the suicide-re- 
lated cases were adolescents, as expected. 
Eighteen percent of the suicide-related cases 
returned in crisis within ayear and six suicides 
were recorded last year. The suicide rate was 
38.2 per 1,000 suicide-related clients served 
during the year. 

Non-hospital-based crisis programs served 
138,300 clients during the past fiscal year. 
Three percent of the caseload were suicide- 
related clients and about 3 percent of the 
suicide-related clients were adolescents. Six 



percent of the suicide-related clients 
returned in crisis within a year. Only 1 death 
from suicide was documented last year and 
the rate of suicide was .22 per 1,000 suicide- 
related clients served. 

Combination programs served 135,169 
clients last fiscal year. About 10 percent 
were suicide-related and 8 percent of the 
suicide-related clients were adolescents. 
Ten percent of the suicide-related cases 
returned in crisis within a year. Twcnty-sbc 
suicides were recorded last year for a rate of 
1.9 suicides per 1,000 suicide-related clients 
served. 

Other programs reported 49,804 clients 
served during the past fiscal year. About 19 
percent were suicide-related clients; 9 per- 
cent of the suicide-related clients returned in 
crisis within a year. Fourteen suicides were 
documented last year resulting in a rate of 1.5 
suicides per 1,000 suicide-related clients ser- 
ved. 

The 287 programs that reported data in this 
section of the survey served 2,423,155 clients 
during the past year. Seven percent were 
suicide-related cases and 9 percent of the 
suicide-related cases were adolescents. Six 
percent of the suicide-related clients 
returned in crisis within a year. The number

Special Problem Areas 

When asked to select all problems ex- 
perienced by their program from a list of 
problems in the survey instrument, staff 
shortage was selected most frequently 
(54%), followed by funding deficiencies 
(43%), funding instability (42%), inadequate 
physical facilities (31%), inadequate referral 
sources (18%), inadequate staff training 
(15%), and troubled volunteers (7%). 

Crisis telephone services selected staff 
shortages as the problem encountered most 
often, followed by funding instability, fund- 
ing deficiency, inadequate physical facilities, 
inadequate referral resources, troubled 
volunteers, and inadequate staff training. 

Walk-in crisis clinics selected problems of in- 
adequate physical facility, funding instability 
and funding deficiency as most often en- 
countered; followed by staff shortages and in- 
adequate staff training, troubled volunteers 
and ina "equate referral resources. 

Hospital-based emergency services listed in- 
adequate physical facility as the most fre- 
quently encountered problem, followed by 
inadequate referral resources, staff 
shortages, funding deficiency, inadequate 
staff training, funding instability and troubled 
volunteers. 

Mental health centers face problems of staff 
shortages most often. Other problems in 
order of most frequently encountered in- 
clude funding deficienq , funding instability, 
inadequate physical facility, inadequate staff 
training, inadequate referral resources, and 
troubled volunteers. 

School-based intervention programs en- 
countered funding instability most often, fol- 
lowed by staff shortages, funding deficiency, 
inadequate physical facility, inadequate staff 
training and inadequate referral resources. 

Non-hospital-based services encountered 
funding instability most often, followed by 

i 



funding deficiency, inadequate referral 
resources, staff shortages, inadequate staff 
training, and inadequate physical facility. 

Combination programs listed the following 
problems in order of frequency: staff 
shortages, funding deficiency, funding in- 
stability, inadequate physical facility, inade- 
quate referral resources, inadequate staff 
training, and troubled volunteers. 

Programs in the "Other* category listed fund- 
ing deficiency as the problem encountered 
most often, followed by staff shortages, fund- 
ing instability, inadequate physical facility, 
short training, inadequate referral resources* 
and troubled volunteers. 

Several programs (35) mentioned that they 
were unable to reach populations at risk due 
to inadequate funding, lack of outreach 
resources, successful suicides not as likely to 
use services as attempters, stigma of mental 
illness, and problems of getting parents invol- 
ved. 

Program Needs 

When asked what more they needed to 
provide adequate services to suicidal adoles- 
cents, relatively few needs were identified by 
the 395 programs other than more funds and 
more staff. In the area of community/school- 
related needs, programs mentioned the need 
to provide programs in schools, more out- 
reach programs, greater community aware- 
ness, more publicity for programs, and more 
advertisements directed toward adolescenu. 

The needs most often stated relating to 
professional issues were for more staff and 
more funds. Training of staff, networking, 
more space, and more staff time were also 
listed in that order, as problems. 

Needs that are associated with specific ser- 
vices to adolescents include residential treat-

adequate service to suicidal adolescents?" 
Leading the list was community education 
followed by more school programs, greater 
recognition of the problem, better coopera- 
tion of schools, more awareness in schools, 
better knowledge of available resources, and 
financial help. 

Professional issues included more resources, 
better networking and better trained person- 
nel. Specific services for adolescents that 
were mentioned as community needs were 
more beds and more services such as out- 
patient services, alternative methods of deal- 
ing with families when parents are problems, 
peer counseling, long-term family-oriented 
treatment, and support groups.

PSYCHOLOGICAL AUTOPSIES OF YOUTH SUICIDES 



Robert E. LUman, M.D., Co-Director, Suicide Prevention Center, Los Angeles, California 



SUMMARY 

Psychological autopsies of youth suicides in- 
dicate that about half of them had a relative- 
ly recent contact with the mental health 
system viewed broadly to include various 
therapists and counselors. Mostly, the inter- 
actions were focused on evaluation and brief 
support. Families and therapists both tended 
to ignore and deny clues to suicide. Since the 
teenage subjects also use denial extensively, 
it takes special efforts to bring suicidal 
youngsters into the helping system and hold 
them there. Continuity of care is recom- 
mended. A team approach (as contrasted 
with one-on-one psychotherapy) might ease 
the therapeutic load of contending with com- 
plex and multi-dimensional pie-suicidal 
states. 

Other features noted from psychological 
autopsies include: 

• Adolescent drug abuse seems to be close- 
ly associated with adolescent suicide, 
especially in older (17-19) males. 

• A suicide in the family is a major stress 
event, leaving survivors at risk for suicide 
themselves. 

• Bereavement counseling is important in 
preventing further suicides. 

• School problems and conduct disorders 
are common in pre-suicidal adolescents. 

• School counseling was important in help- 
ing some control cases avoid self-destruc- 
tive acts. 



My task is to review reports of psychological 
autopsies of suicides among young people in 
order to clarify the possible role of preven- 
tion and/or treatment activities in these 
cases. Psychological autopsies are retrospec- 
tive biographies of deceased persons based 
on interviews with family members, friends, 
teachers and physicians. The lifestyles, 
symptoms and behaviors, personal and oc- 
cupational histories, and medical records are 
reviewed by a death investigation team. 

As we reconstruct the lives of persons who 
are now deceased, we think of the subjects as 
having been in "pre-suicidal" states. The in- 
vestigations reveal that these "pre-suicidal" 
subjects do not make up a homogeneous 
population. Instead, they tend to differ in 
various characteristics and behaviors, they 
represent different psychological and 
psychiatric diagnoses, and they have en- 
countered different types of environmental 
stresses A majority had communicated 
some'hifi.i, about their discomfort to some- 
one else, a peer, family member or profes- 
sional person. Many of the subjects might 
have revealed further clues to suicide if they 
had been questioned specifically about 
suicidal thoughts. 

Some of the pre-suicidal adolescents were 
diagnosed as "depressed." Others were 
described as having "conduct disorders." 
Some were high achievers and some were low 
achievers. Some were physically impaired, 
others were successful athletes. What ail of 
them had in common were periods of hope-

lessncss and thoughts of death as a solution 
to then' problems. 

I think of such ''pre-suicidar individuals as 
having existed in a psycho-social **suicide 
zone** which is populated by many people, of 
whom only a minority kill themselves. In a 
given period of time, say a year, only 1 per- 
cent of the people in the "suicide zone** ac- 
tually commit suicide. That does not mean 
that the other 99 percent are "false positives" 
in the sense that treating them is unnecessary 
or a waste of resources. Probably, all of the 
pre-suicidal persons are in need of some 
preventive therapy, and, of course, some 
need more intense treatment efforts than 
others. 

If we defme "treatments" as human interac- 
tions in which there are some formal aspects 
or rules by which one set of persons 
(therapists) expend efforts to be helpful to 
other persons (the clients or subjects), it is 
apparent that treatment has a number of 
forms. For example, treatment may consist 
of an initial consultation or evaluation or a 
brief contact during a crisis giving immediate 
support. Depending on the needs of the sub- 
ject, appropriate treatment might involve the 
family, a peer group, a prolonged drug 
rehabilitation program, hospitalization-with 
'^r without various medical drugs-or long- 
term out-patient psychotherapy. I have sur- 
veyed the major psychological autopsy 
studies for what they reveal about youthful 
suicides and the treatment that was available, 
offered and/or accepted. 

Studies of adult suicides, using the 
psychological autopsy methodology, have 
clarified a number of suicide-related vari- 
ables. For example, intention, communica- 
tion of suicidal clues, stress factors, and the 
specific medical and psychiatric diagnoses. 
Studies of youth suicide bajed on reviews of 
records have been reported by Sanborn (1), 
Shaffer (2), Cosand, Bourque, and Kraus, (3) 
and others. All note that adolescent suicides 
are preceded by recognizable psychological 
maladjustment. In Shaffer's 1974 sample of 
children's suicide, (n=30), 30 percent were 
in treatment or were waiting to get into treat- 



ment. Social withdrawal and friendlessness 
were common. Many children were recog- 
nized as having conduct disorders or emo- 
tional problems at school. 

Sanborn reviewed the lives of ten adolescent 
suicides in New Hampshire. Five had some 
difficulty in school adjustment. Four had 
threatened suicide previously. All the 
families were intact, but only two families 
described themselves as being "happy" 
families. Most of the youth suicides ap- 
peared to be impulsive rather than planned. 

Cosand and associates reviewed Sacramento 
coroner's data. They concluded that impor- 
tant stresses on youth who commit suicide 
were loss of love, family conflicts, and 
psychiatric disorders which impeded adjust- 
ment to adult roles. They found multiple 
predictors of suicide and recommended im- 
proved training for physicians, police, 
families, employers, and school personnel in 
recognizing pre-suicidal symptoms and in im- 
proving communication with young persons. 

Only recently have investigators studied 
youth suicides in more adequate numbers 
using comparison or control groups. The 
largest research program has been under way 
for several years, directed by Dr. David Shaf- 
fer (4,5) in New York. In a project con- 
ducted by Dr. Mohammad Shafii (6,7) and his 
colleagues in Lx)uisville, peers of the victim 
were used as controls. A third notable source 
of data are the reports beginning to come 
from the "San Diego Suicide Study" by Drs. 
Rich, Young, and Fowler (8). TTiey com- 
pared suicides among persons under and 
over age 30. My own group in Los Angeles 
(9) published some pilot studies quite similar 
to Shafii's, and we are now engaged in inves- 
tigating all youth suicides in California during 
a set study period. Finally, the Centers for 
Disease Control in Atlanta has been assem- 
bling information on youth suicide through 
psychological autopsies conducted in several 
different locations. All of the investigations 
have obtained a good deal of information 
about treatment and prevention, but these 
factors have not been consistently or careful- 
ly analyzed and interpreted, and at present

are considered to be quite obscure. 

Shafii and associates investigated 25 cases of 
youth suicide occurring between January 
1980 and June 1983. Their subjects were 95 
percent white and 90 percent males. The 
same standardized interview form was used 
to secure information about a matched con- 
trol, often the victim's closest friend. No 
statistically significant difference was found 
between the victims and the control subjects 
regarding such variables as "broken home", 
separation from parents, or birth order. 

There were significant differences in ex- 
posure to suicide through suicidal siblings, 
friends, parents, or other relatives and dif- 
ferences in previous expressions of suicidal 
ideation, suicide threats, or suicide attempts. 
The frequent use of non-prescribed drugs or 
alcohol was p'^ociated with suicide, as was 
anti-social behavior, and "inhibited per- 
sonality." There had been previous 
psychiatric treatment for 9 of 20 suicide vic- 
tims and 4 of 17 control subjects. These in- 
vestigators agree with Cosand, et al. that a 
close relationship exists between suicidal 
wishes, threats, attempts, and completed 
suicide. Successful prevention involves 
reducing exposure to suicidal images and 
thoughts and replacing these with more posi- 
tive concepts. 

Three cases were presented by Shafii in con- 
siderable detail. A 17-year old white male 
shot himself in his bedroom. A week before 
his death, his mother called the pediatrician's 
office and asked for help. "My son is 
depressed and moody", she said. "He has a 
hard time going to sleep. His personality has 
changed." A week later, the boy's father 
called the pediatrician and expressed fear for 
his son who seems to be incoherent and bel- 
ligerent. "We are worried that he is taking 
drugs." There was a confrontation between 
son and father over this issue after which the 
son said, "You'll be sorry." The pediatrician 
suggested a psychiatric consultation, but the 
family felt it was not that serious, yet. 

A second case involved an 18-year old male 
who was having school problems and injuries 



which took him out of athletics. He began to 
make suicide threats to his girl friend and 
other people and to search for his biological 
father who had long since dropped out of 
sight. Said the boy, "I'm like my real dad. I'm 
just crazy." The clinical course was one of 
progressive dissatisfaction. He was having 
problerds with his friends. A few days before 
his death, his mother tried to make an ap- 
pointment for him to see someone at a men- 
tal health clinic because of his withdrawal and 
his appearance of being spaced out with no 
plans for his life, but the victim expressed 
resentment and said he did not need help. 

The emphasis for Shafii is on the failure to 
get these suicide victims into treatment and 
keep them there. His group strongly stresses 
the grief and guilt reactions in surviving fami- 
ly persons and believes that the postvention 
efforts of their suicide research team may 
have been effective suicide prevention for 
the survivors that they interviewed. It would 
be instructive to review the cases of the non- 
suicides for factors which were associated 
with survival. 

By far the largest and most sophisticated 
study of youth suicide is being conducted by 
a group at the New York Psychiatric Institute 
led by David Shaffer. In a preliminary report, 
Shaffer stated that approximately half of the 
completed youth suicides had been in touch 
with the mental health system at some time. 
His findings indicate that slightly less than 
half of the victims were depressed and about 
the same number had a family history of 
suicide attempts. At least half of the male 
suicide victims had been in trouble because 
of impulsive behavior, learning difficulties 
and aggressive outbursts. Approximately 
half of the suicide victims had been using ex- 
cessive amounts of drugs or alcohol. About 
a third had made a serious suicide attempt. 
These investigators believe, that in all 
likelihood, other, better defined high risk 
groups will emerge from the study once the 
data have been fully analyzed. According to 
Shaffer, he has not considered the role of 
treatment, but in personal communications, 
indicated that a major problem has been

Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



keeping young people involved in a 
therapeutic contact. 

In his preliminary report, Shaffer indicates 
that it may be premature to attempt to 
evaluate prevention or treatment programs. 
However, I interpret these findings to indi- 
cate a need for effective anti-depressant 
treatment uf these adolescents who are 
depressed. The prevention and treatment of 
early delinquency and early drug abuse 
remain as key unsolved issues. One program 
has stressed serial intemews with young 
women who had made suicide attempts. 
These women are often deprecated by their 
families, have rather poor personal relation- 
ships, and suffer from low self esteem. The 
program's goal is to rebuild self esteem and 
~ self confidence through increased coping 
skills. 

On the basis of his experience to date. Dr. 
Shaffer recommends improved mental 
health courses such as seminars or workshops 
to help students and parents identify sig- 
nificant psychiatric problen*^. In particular, 
they should have information about the 
major psychiatnc illnesses, eating disorders, 
and should be able to identify for themselves 
abnormal degrees of anxiety and depression. 
As Dr. Shaffer points out, suicide is only one 
possible bad outcome from adolescent 
psychiatric disorders; identification and 
treatment of other aspects would prevent a 
good deal of misery and disability in general. 
Dr. Shaffer believes that routine school- 
based screening and treatment referral for 
teenagers with depressive symptoms, espe- 
cially those who have fallen behind in school 
or who are getting into trouble, would be ef- 
fective prevention. He stresses teaching 
psychological strategies, for example, coping 
and problem solving ukiWs to troubled 
teenagers. First courses would dramatize 
how to say "no" when offered drugs, or how 
to communicate and negotiate with family 
members and peers. 

Shaffer believes that better training for 
pediatric and psychiatric emergency room 
staffs is necessary to identify suicide at- 
tempters who are at especially high risk. It 



would be good to have more well-publicized 
hotlines and drop-in clinics so teenagers 
would know about them and use them. 

Finally, Dr. Shaffer would like to see ex- 
panded insurance coverage for crisis situa- 
tions which may be life-threatening through 
self-destructive behaviors. 

Charles L. Rich, M.D. and his associates. Dr. 
Young and Dr. Fowler, have reported some 
of their investigations under the title "San 
Diego Suicide Study." They noted that when 
they compared completed suicides in people 
under 30 with completed suicides of people 
over age 30, there were many similarities and 
a few differences. In terms of psychiatric 
diagnoses, the younger group had significant- 
ly more drug abuse and anti-social per- 
sonalities, significantly less alcohol abuse, 
fewer affective disorders and fewer organic 
syndromes. Often, in the younger group, a 
drug or alcohol use disorder was combined 
with some other psychiatric diagnosis. 

Rich and his colleagues also noted that 
suicide is a particular problem of white males. 
They performed structured interviews on 
suicide ca.«es in San Diego starting in 1981. 
They placed special emphasis on obtaining as 
complete a toxicology screening as possible. 
They tried to arrive at a consensus diagnosis 
based on DSM III criteria. They were 
surprised to discover that most of the people 
in the younger age group were not living 
alone. About half of their cases had some 
prior treatment and about a quarter ap- 
peared to be in treatment at the time of 
death. They remarked that these figures 
showed no change in rate in the past 25 years. 
"One might think that a quarter century of 
heightened awareness to the relationship be- 
tween psychiatric illness and suicide would 
have led to a higher treatment rate in such an 
obviously ill population." Significantly, more 
young people than older people hang them- 
selves, but as in previous U.S. studies, the use 
of firearms predominated. Rich emphasizes 
the frequency of alcohol and drug use disor- 
der particularly in the younger group, and he 
concludes that drug use may be the most im- 
portant single factor in the suicide rate in-

crease in youth in the United States. 

Considering stressors, they found the 
younger group had more separations and 
rejections compared to the older group, 
where the subjects had more mental illnesses. 
Overall, they found that there was an ex- 
tremely complex interplay of diagnostic 
categories. 

My colleagues and I are now (Spring, 1986) 
investigating youth suicides in California. 
We have noted in our early cases that al- 
though almost half of the subjects were 
known to mental health personnel, the 
deaths came as a surprise and a shock to al- 
most all of the involved counselor-therapists. 
The most conspicuous aspect of treatment 
failure revealed by psychological autopsies 
was that the adolescent was referred to 
therapy but did not make or keep the refer- 
ral appointment Or, the family did not 
cooperate. 

The psychological autopsies underlined the 
warning of school problems and failures. We 
suggest exit counseling when students drop 
out. On a positive note, we feel that survival 
in our peer control group is related to the 
young person having at least one positive 
"role model", or stable older person who can 
be idealized. 

In tweWe cases described by Litman and 
Diller (9), there were four therapy contacts, 
two in the suicide cases and two in the con- 
trols. Our tentative interpretation is that 
crisis interviews were insufficient for the 
chronic and multiple problems of the suicide 
cases. One of the controls benefited greatly 
from school counseling that eventually be- 
came long term. The counseling, originally 
for learning and behavior problems, helped 
him academically and also helped him cope 
better in his personal life. 

The cases dramatized the problems with con- 
fiding in a peer. While one person was led 
into effective counseling, another student 
confided to a friend that he was going to kill 
himself, but forbade the friend to tell anyone. 
After the suicide, the friend became suicidal 
himself, but was helped by the school coun- 



selor and a psychiatrist. In the older 
teenagers, alcohol and drug abuse coniribute 
to the feeling of uselessness, failure, and con- 
fusion, "I just can't get it together." 

Experience with suicidal alcoholics, especial- 
ly the failure of a one-on-one volunteer 
counseling program (10), convinced of 
the importance of a team approach to 
suicidal substance abusers. To get the young 
person into therapy and hold him, we need to 
involve family, tiriends, and peers-a group 
process. 

The treatment experiences of most of the 
young persons who coirmitted suicide could 
best be characterized as brief episodes of 
evaluative or supportive therapy. Both the 
families and the professional health workers 
tended to ignore and deny clues to suicide. 
Beyond that, the cases illustrate the diversity 
and multiplicity of the people and the 
problems. 



Case Illustration 1. 

J, age 19, was hospitalized at County Hospi- 
tal for short periods, once for a PCP 
psychosis and once for alcohol abuse. He was 
unemployed, from a broken family, had no 
goals, just existed. The final stressor event 
occurred when his girl friend left to join the 
army telling J, "You'll never amount to any- 
thing." His out-patient therapist was shock- 
ed when J shot himself. "J often told me he 
wished he were dead, but he said suicide was 
a sin, and he would never do it." In 
retrospect, the doctor felt that the problems 
were too many and too overwhelming and 
the therapy too little and too late. What 
might have made more of a difference would 
have been a placement off the streets into a 
structured environment, such as a work 
camp, an in-house drug rehabilitation 
program, or even possibly, the armed forces. 

Case Illustration 2. 

Institutions don't always guarantee security. 
B was a 15-year old male who hanged himself 



ERIC

Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



in his room at the juvenile detention facility. 
He had been in trouble in school, had stolen 
a bicycle, taken money from his mother's 
purse, smoked marijuana and was sent to 
detention (rather than bailed out) in order to 
"teach him a lesson." Three weeks earlier, he 
overdosed on aspirin. Two days before, he 
cut his wrist, causing a noticeable lesion al- 
though no important structures were 
severed. The admitting social worker asked 
6 if he was suicidal. B said no, not now. 
Later, staff persons, noting the cut wrist and 
negative attitude of B, asked about suicide 
precautions and were told by the social 
worker not to worry. In retrospect, the 
evaluator said that he now understands that 
suicidal teenagers do not necessarily present 
themselves as "depressed." 

Case Illustration 3. 

C, an age 16 1/2 female, was seeing a coun- 
selor once a week at an anti-drug abuse 
oriented community center. C was hard 
looking, dressed punk, acted tough. She was 
also a talented musician and poet, struggling 
with a chaotic home life and her own confus- 
ing bisexuality. When she hanged herself, 
she left a three page note beginning, "to let 
you know I didn't want it to happen. Sorry. 
I just wanted to be accepted. Love you. So 
young, so brave, and yet so weak." The 
therapist was puzzled over the suicide. With 
some guilt, he admitted he had been seeing 
both C and her father separately and in- 
dividually in treatment, and maybe this arran- 
gement had been detrimental for C, since the 
therapist had considered the father to have 
the more important impairment. 

Case Illustration 4. 

The death of M, female, age 17, should have 
been prevented. She took an overdose of im- 
ipramine, a tricyclic anti-depressant, after 
being rejected by her boy friend. Her family 
took her to the hospital where she was ob- 
served briefly and discharged prematurely. 
At home, several hours later, she had a series 
of convulsive seizures and died. 



M had been seen several times by a male so- 
cial worker who thought the therapeutic in- 
teraction was excellent. She came firom an 
intact and supportive family, was a high 
achiever, and had been admitted to Harvard 
University. The psychiatric consultant who 
prescribed the imipran ine was also 
surprised. In retrospect, they recalled that 
although M was talented and artistic, she had 
a poor self image and was overly dependent 
on her boy friend. There had been a previous 
overdose with tylenol. This case raises the 
problem of how much anti-depressant to 
prescribe as take-home medication for per- 
sons who have recently taken an overdose of 
other less toxic medicines. 

Other noted features include the following: 
Adolescent drug abuse seems to be closely 
associated with adolescent suicide, especial- 
ly in older (17-19) males. A suicide in the 
family is a major stress event, leaving sur- 
vivors at risk for suicide themselves; bereave- 
ment counseling is important in preventing 
further suicides. School problems and con- 
duct disorders are common in pre-suicidal 
adolescents. School counseling was impor- 
tant in helping some control cases avoid self- 
destructive acts.

GAY MALE AND LESBIAN YOUTH SUICIDE 



Paul Gibson, L.C.S. W., Therapist and Program Consultant, San Francisco, California 



SUMMARY 

Gay and lesbian youth belong to two groups 
at high risk of suicide: youth and 
homosexuals. A majority of suicide attempts 
by homosexuals occur during their youth, and 
gay youth are 2 to 3 times more likely to at- 
tempt suicide than other young people. They 
may comprise up to 30 percent of completed 
youth suicides annually. The earlier youth 
are aware of their orientation and identify 
themselves as gay, the greater the conflicts 
they have. Gay youth face problems in ac- 
cepting themselves due to internalization of 
a negative self image and the lack of accurate 
information about homosexuality during 
adolescence. Gay youth face extreme physi- 
cal and verbal abuse, rejection and isolation 
from family and peers. They often feel total- 
ly alone and socially withdrawn out of fear of 
adverse consequences. As a result of these 
pressures, lesbian and gay youth are more 
vulnerable than other youth to psychosocial 
problems including substance abuse, chronic 
depression, school failure, early relationship 
conflicts, being forced to leave their families, 
and having to survive on their own prema- 
turely. Each of these problems presents a 
risk factor for suicidal feelings and behavior 
among gay, lesbian, bisexual and transsexual 
youth. 

The root of the problem of gay youth suicide 
is a society that discriminates against and stig- 
matizes homof exuals while failing to recog- 
nize that a substantial number of its youth has 
a gay or lesbian orientation. Legislation 
should to guarantee homosexuals equal 
rights in our society. We need to make a con- 



scious effort to promote a positive image of 
homosexuals at all levels of society that 
provides gay youth with a diversity of lesbian 
and gay male adult role models. We each 
need to take personal responsibility for revis- 
ing homophobic attitudes and conduct. 
Families should be educated about the 
development and positive nature of 
homosexuality. They must be able to accept 
their child as gay or lesbian. Schools need to 
include information about homosexuality in 
their curriculum and protect gay youth from 
abuse by peers to ensure they receive an 
equal education. Helping professionals need 
to accept and support a homosexual orienta- 
tion in youth. Social services need to be 
developed that are sensitive to and reflective 
of the needs of gay and lesbian youth. 

INTRODUCTION 

Suicide is the leading cause of death among 
gay male^ lesbian, bisexual and transsexual 
youth.* They are part of two populations at 
serious risk of suicide: sexual minorities and 
the young. Agency statistics and coroner 
reports seldom reflect how suicidal behavior 
is related to sexual orientation or identity is- 
sues. The literature on youth suicide has vir- 
tually ignored the subject. Research in 
recent years, however, with homosexual 
young people and adults has revealed a 
serious problem with cause for alarm. 

*The terms "gay youth* and 'gay and lesbian youth' will fre- 
quently be used to describe this population in the paper. 
Transsexual youth are included here because their 
problems are similar to those experienced by youth who 
«ave a minority sexual orientation.

P.Gibson: Gay Male and Lesbian Youth Suicide 



Statistical Profile 

There is a high rate of suicidality among les- 
bians and gay men. Jay and Young found 
that 40 percent of gay males and 39 percent 
of lesbians surveyed had either attempted or 
seriously contemplated suicide (1). Bell and 
Weinberg similarly found that 35 percent of 
gay males and 38 percent of lesbians in their 
study had either seriously considered or at- 
tempted suicide (2). Homosexuals are far 
more likely to attempt suicide than are 
heterosexuals. A majority of these attempts 
take place in their youth. Bell and Weinberg 
found that 25 percent of lesbians and 20 per- 
cent of gay men had actually attempted 
suicide. Gay males were 6 times more likely 
to make an attempt then heterosexual males. 
Lesbians were more than twice as likely to try 
committing suicide than the heterosexual 
women in the study i majority of the suicide 
attempts by homosexuals took place at age 20 
or younger with nearly one-third occurring 
before age 17. 

Suicidal behavior by gay and lesbian youth, 
however, occurs today within the broader 
context of an epidemic increase in suicide 
among all young people in our society. Bet- 
ween 1950 and 1980, there was an increase 
of more than 170 percent in suicides by youth 
between the ages of 15 and 24 (3). The 
suicide rate for all age groups rose only 20 
percent during that time. At least 5,000 
youth now take their lives each year with the 
number believed to be significantly higher if 
deliberate auto accidents, victim precipitated 
homicides, and inconclusive coroner reports 
are taken into account. The rate of suicide 
attempts to completions is much higher 
among young people than any other age 
group with as many as 500,000 attempts an- 
nually. This leads us to believe that many 
times a suicide attempt by a young person is 
really a cry for help. 

Gay and lesbian youth have been a hidden 
population within the adolescent and young 
adult age group. Those programs and studies 
able to document suicidality in gay youth 
have found they have a high rate of suicidal 
feelings and behavior that places them at sub- 



stantially greater risk of taking their own lives 
compared to other youth (See Appendix A). 
Statistics from the Institute for the Protec- 
tion of Gay and Lesbian Youth in New York, 
the University of Minnesota Adolescent 
Health Program in Minneapolis, Roesler and 
Dei:her in Seattle, and the Los Angeles 
Suicide Prevention Center consistently show 
that 20-35 percent of gay youth interviewed 
hr.ve made suicide attempts (4,5,6,7). Statis- 
tics from Minneapolis, Los Angeles and San 
Francisco find that more than 50 percent of 
gay youth experience suicidality including 
serious depression and suicidal feelings 
(5,7,8). The Larkin Street Youth Center in 
San Francisco found that among iheir client 
population of homeless youth, 65 percent of 
homosexuaVbisexual youth compared to 19 
percent of heterosexual youth reported ever 
being suicidal, and that gay youth had a rate 
of suicidality nearly 3.5 times greater than 
other youth (8). The Los Angeles Suicide 
Prevention Center in preliminary data from 
an unpublished study, found that the suicide 
attempt i:>te for gay youth is more than ? 
times higher than that of heterosexual youth; 
their rate of suicidality is more than twice that 
of other youth (7). 

Why are feelings of self-destructiveness and 
suicidal behavior so prevalent among gay and 
lesbian youth? How can we learn to recog- 
nize these youth better and help them more 
effectively in coping with the problems that 
often lead them to want to take their own 
lives? The rest of this paper attempts to ad- 
dress these issues by providing an ovendew 
of the tasks and problems facing gay youth, 
an understanding of who they are, factors 
that place gay youth at risk of suicide, and an 
approach for society as a whole and the in- 
dividual helping professional in effectively 
helping these youth and preventing thern 
from taking their lives. 

Tasks of the Gay Adciescent 

Gay youth face the double jeopardy of sur- 
viving adolescence and developing a positive 
identity as a lesbian, gay male, bisexual, or 
transsexual in what is frequently a hostile and

condemning environment. Contrary to 
popular belief, adolescence is not the time of 
our lives. It is a difOculi and comply period 
of development filled wiih anxiety and few 
clear guidelines for helping youth resolve the 
problems they face, often for the first time, 
and making the transition to adulthood. 
Youth are going through physical changes, 
emotional changes, intellectual changes and 
sexual development all within the context of 
their particular culture, family, peer group, 
and capacity as individuals. They must ac- 
complish several formidable tasks including 
separating from their families while ret'iining 
a core sense of belonging (individuation), 
learning to form relationships with ether 
people while fitting in with a social structure 
(socialization), establishing {.n integiated, 
positive, individual identity (ioentity forma- 
tion) and preparing themselves lor the future 
in an increasingly complex and uncertain 
world (future orientation). 

Problems in accomplishing the^*^ tasks play a 
critical role in the suicida' igs of any 
youth but present special hardships for those 
who are gay or lesbian. First they must come 
to understand and accept themselves in a 
society that provides them with little positive 
information about who they are and negative 
reactions to their inquiries. Second, they 
must find support among significant others 
who frequently reject them. Finally, they 
must make a social adaptation to their gay or 
lesbian identity. They must find where they 
belong and how they fit in with a social struc- 
ture that either offers no guidelines fordoing 
so or tells them that they have no place. 

With the advent of the sexual revolution and 
gay liberation movement of the past two 
' decades, gay and lesbian youth have been in- 
creasingly aware of their feelings and coming 
to terms with their orientation at an earlier 
age than ever before. Thi" has placed them 
into direct conflict with all of the traditional 
childrearing institutions and support systems 
of our society. Increasingly, this occurs while 
the youngsters are still living at home with 
their family, attending public school and 
developing a sense of their own self worth in

comparison *Aith their peers and the expecta- 
tions of society as a whole. 

Problems Facing Gay Youth 

Lesbian and gay youth are the most invisible 
and outcast group of young people with 
whom you will come into contact. If open 
about who they are, they may feel some sense 
of security within themselves but face 
tremendous external conflicts with family 
and peers. If closed about who they are, they 
may be able to "pass** as "stnight** in their 
communities while facing a tremendous in- 
ternal struggle to understand and accept 
themselves. Many gay youth choose to main- 
tain a facade and hide their true feelings and 
identity, leading a double life, rather than 
confront situations too painful for them. 
They live in constant fear of being found out 
and recognized as gay. The reasons for their 
silence are good ones. 

Gay youth are the only group of adolescents 
that face total rejection from their family unit 
with the prospect of no ongoing support. 
Many families are unable to reconcile their 
child's sexual identity with moral ar.d 
religious values. Huckleberry House in San 
Francisco, a runaway shelter for adolescents, 
found that gay and lesbian youth reported a 
higher incidence of verbal and physical abuse 
from parents and siblings than other youth 
(9). They were more often forced to leave 
their homes as "pushaways** or "throwaways" 
rather than running away on their own. In a 
study of young gay males, Remafedi found 
that ha!f had experienced negative parental 
response to their sexual orientation with 26 
percent forced to leave home because of con- 
flicts over their sexual identity (5). 

Openly gay and lesbian youth or those 
"suspected" of being so can expect harass- 
ment and abuse in junior high and high 
schools. The National Gay Task Force, in a 
nationwide survey, found that 45 percent of 
gay males and nearly 20 percent of lesbians 
had experienced verbal or physical a 
secondaiy schools (10). The shame Oi 
ridicule and fear of 'ittack makes school a 
fearful place to go r :^uiting in frequent ab- 



117

sences and sometimes academic failure. 
Remafedi reports 28 percent of his subjects 
were forced to drop out because of conflicts 
about their sexual orientation (S). Gay 
youth are the only group of adolescents with 
no peer group to identify with or receive sup- 
port from. Many report extreme isolation 
and the loss of close friends. 

Gay youth also face discrimination in con- 
tacts with the juvenile justice system and 
foster and group home placements.* Many 
families and group homes refuse to accept or 
keep an adolescent if th^ know he or she is 
gay. A report by the San Francisco Juvenile 
Justice Commission found that gay youth stay 
in detention longer than other youth await- 
ing placement because of a lack of ap- 
propriate program resources (11). Many 
programs are unable to address the concerns 
or affirm the identity of a gay adolescent. 
They can be subjected to verbal, physical, and 
even sexual abuse with little rfxourse. Even 
sympathetic staff often don't loiow how to re- 
late to a gay youth or support them in con- 
flicts Willi other residents. They frequently 
become isolated, ignored by youth and staff 
who feel uncomfortable with them. They are 
easy targets for being blamed and 
scapegoated as the "source" of the problem 
in efforts to force them to leave. 

The result of this rejection and abuse in all 
areas of their lives is devastating for lesbian 
and gay youth and perhaps the most serious 
problems they face are emotional ones. 
When you have been told that you are sick, 
bad, and wrong for being who you are, you 
begin to believe it. Gay youth have frequent- 
ly internalized a negative image of themsel- 
ves. Those who hide their identity are 
surrounded by homophobic attitudes and 
remarks, often by unknowing family mem- 
bers and peers, that have a profound impact 
on them. Hank Wilson, founder of the Gay 
and Lesbian Teachers Coalition in San Fran- 

: (K my obseivation that youth are experiencing more fre- 
quent conuct with the juvenile court due to 1) increased 
conflicu in their home communities because of their sexual 
orientation which require intervention and removal from 
the home and 2) being open about their sexual identity at 
an earlier age than before. 



Cisco, believes these youth constitute a large 
group who are silently scapegoated, especial- 
ly vulnerable to being stigmatized, and who 
develop poor self esteem (12). Gay youth be- 
come fearful and withdrawn. More than 
other adolescents, they feel totally alone 
often suffering from chronic depression, 
despairing of life that will always be as pain- 
ful and hard as the present one. 

In response to these overwhelming pres- 
sures, gay youth will often use two coping 
mechanisms which only tend to make their 
situation worse: substance use and profes- 
sional help. Lesbian and gay male youth 
belong to two groups at high risk for sub- 
stance abuse: homosexuals and adolescents. 
Rofes found, in a review of the literature, 
that: 

Lesbians and gay men are at much 
higher risk than the heterosexual 
population for alcohol abuse. Ap- 
proximately 30 percent of both the 
lesbian and gay male populations 
have problems with alcoholism (13). 

Substance use often begins in early adoles- 
cence when youth first experience conflicts 
around their sexual orientation. It initially 
serves the functional purposes of (1) reduc- 
ing the pain and anxiety of external conflicts 
and (2) reducing the internal inhibitions of 
homosexual feelings and behavior. 
Prolonged substance abuse, however, only 
contributes to the youth's problems and mag- 
nifies suicidal feelings. 

Several studies have found that a majority of 
gay youth received professional help for con- 
flicts usually related to their sexual identity 
(5,6). These interventions often worsen con- 
ditions for these youth because the therapist 
or social worker is unwilling to acknowledge 
or support an adolescent's homosexual iden- 
tity. Many gay and lesbian youth are still en- 
couraged to "change" their identities while 
being forced into therapy and mental hospi- 
tals under the guise of "treatment." 

Those who seek help while hiding their iden- 
tity often find the source of their conflicts is 
never resolved because the therapist is un- 



lis

able to approach the subject This silence is 
taken as further repudiation of an "illness" 
that dare not speak its name. 

A suicide attempt can be a Hnal ciy for help 
by gay youth in their home community. If the 
response is hostile or indifferent, they 
prepare to leave. Alone and frightened, they 
go to larger cities-hoping to find families and 
friends to replace the ones that did not wai t 
them or could not accept them. The English 
group "The Bronski Beat" describes the 
plight of the gay adolescent in their song 
"Smalltown Boy": 

Pushed around and kicked around, 

always the lonely boy 
You were the one they talked about 
Around town as they put you down 
But as hard as they would try 

just to make you cry 
You would never cry to them 

— just to your soul 
Runaway, turnaway, runaway, 

tumaway, runaway (14). 

Gay male, lesbian, bisexual, and transsexual 
youth comprise as many as 25 percent of all 
youth living on the streets in this country. 
Here, they enter a further outcast status that 
presents serious dangers and an even greater 
risk of suicide. Without an adequate educa- 
tion or vocational training, many are forced 
to become involved in prostitution in order 
to survive. They face physical and sexual as- 
saults on a daily basis and constant exposure 
to sexually transmitted diseases including 
AIDS. They often become involved with a 
small and unstable element of the gay com- 
munity that offers them little hope for a bet- 
ter life. Their relationships are transitory 
and untrustworthy. For many street youth, 
their struggle for survival becomes the fulfill- 
ment of a "suicidal script" which sees them en- 
gaging in increasingly self-destructive 
behaviors including unsafe sexual activity 
and intravenous drug use. Overwhelmed by 
the complexities of street life and feeling they 
have reached the "wrong end of the rainbow" 
a suicide attempt may result. 

While it has become easier in recent years to 



be a gay male or lesbian adult it may be har- 
der than ever to be a gay youth. With all of 
the conflicts they face in accepting themsel- 
ves, coming out to families and peers, estab- 
lishing themselves prematurely in 
independent living and, for young gay males, 
confronting the haunting specter of AIDS, 
there is a growing danger that their lives are 
becoming a tragic nightmare with living only 
a small part of dying. 

UNDERSTANDING GAY AND 
LESBIAN YOUTH 

Lesbian and gay male youth are young people 
with a primary attraction to members of the 
same sex for sexual and intimate relation- 
ships. Bisexual youth have an attraction to 
members of both sexes for sexual and in- 
timate relationships. We use the term orien- 
tation rather than preference to describe this 
attraction because we still do not know how 
it originates. We are not certain to what ex- 
tent genetics, socialization factors or in- 
dividual choice determines either a 
homosexual or heterosexual orientation. 
Transsexual youth are young people who 
believe they have a gender identity that is dif- 
ferent from the sex they were bom with. This 
includes young males who believe they are 
really females mistakenly bom in a male body 
and young females who believe they are real- 
ly males mistakenly bom in a female body. 
Sexual orientation and gender identity are 
separate issues for each individual. 
Transsexuals may have a heterosexual, 
homosexual, or bisexual orientation. 
Homosexuals are rarely confused about their 
gender identity with lesbians believing they 
are women and gay males believing tiiey are 
men. 

There are indications that individuals may be 
predisposed to their sexual orientation from 
an early age. A gay or lesbian orientation in 
adolescence is not just a phase the youth is 
going through. Bell, Weinberg, and Ham- 
mersmith found that sexual orientation is 
likely to be formed by adolescence-even if 
the youth is not yet sexually active (15). 



119 



P.Gibson: Gay Male and Lesbian Youth Suicide 



Childhood and adolescent honr^ 
sexuality, especially pronounced 
homosexual feelings, can not be 
regarded as just a passing fan(7...[it] 
seems to be relatively enduring and 
so deeply rooted that it is likely to 
continue as a lasting homosexual 
orientation in adult life. 

Huckleberry House found that, when given 
a choice, adolescents demonstrate a greater 
degree of conviction than confusion in iden- 
tifying their sexual orientation, with 75 per- 
cent self-reporting as heterosexual, 15 
percent homosexual, 5 percent bisexual, and 
only 5 percent confused or undecided (9). 
Most youth who identify as heterosexuals 
and homosexuals will continue to do so as 
adults. Youth are more likely to underreport 
a homosexual orientation because of difficul- 
ties in accepting themselves and the fear of a 
hostile response. Jay and Young found that 
56 percent of the lesbian respondents in their 
survey had previously identified as bisexual 
while only 16 percent currently did so (1). 
Forty-six percent of the gay males had pre- 
viously identified as bisexual while only 20 
percent currently did so. 

Homosexuality is not a mental illness or dis- 
ease. It is a natural and healthy expression of 
human sexuality. In 1935, Sigmund Freud 
wrote that "Homosexuality...is nothing to be 
ashamed of, no vice, no degradation, it can 
not be classified as an illness" (16). In 1973, 
the American Psychiatric Association 
removed homosexuality from the list of 
psychiatric disorders and, in 1975, the 
American Psychological Association urged 
all mental health professionals to remove the 
stigma of mental illness long associated with 
a homosexual orientation. In 1983, the 
American Academy of Pediatrics en- 
couraged physicians to become involvev^ in 
the care of homosexuals and other young 
people struggling with the problem of sexual 
expression (5). If homosexuality is not an ill- 
ness or a disorder, it can not be regarded as 
such to the extent that it occurs in the young. 

Gay and lesbian youth come from all ethnic 
backgrounds. The ethnicity of gay youth will 



reflect the ethnicity of youth in your com- 
munity or seen by your agency. The Institute 
for the Protection of Gay and Lesbian Youth 
reports the ethnic breakdown oil youth it 
served, matched the population of New 
York's public school system with >\0 i}ercent 
black, 35 percent white, 20 percent Hispanic, 
2 percent Asian and 3 percent other (4). 
Huckleberry House in San Francisco found 
that more than half of their overall client 
population and gay youth seen by the 
program were ethnic minorities (9). 

There are far more gay youth than you are 
presently aware of. Kinsey found a sig- 
nificant amount of homosexual behavior 
among adolescents surveyed with 28 percent 
of the males and 17 percent of the females 
reporting at least one homosexual ex- 
perience (17,18). He also founu that ap- 
proximately 13 percent of adult males and 7 
percent of adult females had engaged in 
predominantly homO/exual behavior for at 
least three ysars prior to his survey. This is 
where the figure that 10 percent of the 
population is homosexual comes from. It is 
difficult to assess the prevalence of a 
homosexual orientation given our 
knowledge that sexual behavior actually oc- 
curs along a continuum of feelings and ex- 
periences. Prevalence is even more difficult 
to estimate among adolescents because of 
the complex identity issues with which they 
are struggling and the scarcity of research on 
the subject. It is apparent, however, that a 
substantial minority of youth-perhaps "One 
in Ten" as one book suggests-have a primary 
gay male, lesbian, or bisexual orientation. 
Given the higher rates of suicidal feelings and 
behavior among gay youth in comparison 
with other young people, this means that 20* 
30 percent of all youth suicides may involve 
gay youth. Parris believes that as many as 
30OO gay and lesbian young people may be 
taking their lives each year (19). 

Coming Out: The Early Stages 

Coming out Is the process through which a 
person comes to understand and accept 
his/her sexual identity and shares it with 




120 



3-115 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



others. This is seldom a conscious undertak- 
ing for heterosexual youth who find that 
being "straight" is a given status in our society. 
It is as automatic as attending school or get- 
ting a driver's license. However, identifying 
oneself as gay or lesbian is a long and painful 
process that only occurs gradually over an ex- 
tended period of time. Stages in the coming 
out process are identified in Appendix B with 
the ages reflecting those of gay and lesbian 
youth whom I worked with at Huckleberry 
House (20,21). • This population represents 
the bias of self-identified gay youth seeking 
services at a runaway program. It is impor- 
tant to recognize, however, that this process 
begins for many lesbian and gay youth at an 
early age with an awareness of their orienta- 
tion often developing by adolescence. It is 
then that they experience significant con- 
flicts involving understanding of whom th^ 
are, handling negative reactions from others 
and making a social adaptation which can 
lead to suicidal feelings and behavior. These 
conflicts must be resolvcu before the youth 
can develop a positive identity as a gay male 
or lesbian. 

The first stage in the development of a les- 
bian or gay identity is an awareness of being 
different. This often occurs several years 
prior to puberty with the youth seldom aware 
of what this feeling means or how it relates 
to their sexuality. Lewis, in describing this 
stage for young lesbians, notes that; 

Because our society and its process 
of socialization do not include a posi- 
tive vocabulary for same-sex attrac- 
tions (whether emotional or erotic), 
many girls experience only vague, un- 
definable feelings of "not fitting in" 
(22). 

Bell, Weinberg, and Hammersmith looked at 
numerous factors (i.e., family relationships) 
in attempting to determine how individuals 
develop a homosexual or heterosexual orien- 
tation (15). They provide evidence that this 
awareness of being different is related to the 
social roles of the child. During latency age 
years, the family often reinforces those roles, 
behaviors, attributes, and interests that are 



stereotypically associated with being a male 
or a female in our society. For example, boys 
are expected to play outside more than girls 
and girls are expected to stay close to the 
house more than boys. Bell, et al. found that 
gay males and lesbians in their study tended 
to have atypical social roles in childhood that 
did not conform to gender expectations while 
heterosexuals tended to have typical social 
roles. 

Far fewer homosexual (11%) than 
heterosexual (70%) men reported 
having enjoyed boys' activities (e.g., 
baseball, football) very much. 

Fewer of the homosexual (13%) than 
heterosexual (55%) women said they 
enjoyed typical girls' activities (e.g., 
playing house, hopscotch) very 
much. 

This finding held true for a range of variables 
involving stereotyped male and female roles 
with gender nonconformity being the single 
most accurate indicator in childhood of a fu- 
ture homosexual orientation (15). However, 
they add a strong point of clarification for 
those who would force gender conformity on 
a child in an effort to "prevent" 
homosexuality. 

Homosexuality is as deeply ingrained 
as heterosexuality, so that differen- 
ces in behaviors or social experiences 
of pre-homosexual boys and girls and 
their pre-heterosexual counterparts 
reflect or express, rather than cause, 
their eventual homosexual (orienta- 
tion). 

This finding does not account for the sub- 
stantial percentage of respondents giving 
answers that were atypical for their sexual 
orientation. Many children, however, who 
later identify as gay or lesbian begin 'o real- 
ize at this early age that they do not meet the 
social expectations of their families and other 
children. 

The second stage of the coming out process 
is an awareness of being attracted to mem- 
bers of the same sex. This also commonly oc- 

121

curs prior to puberty with many gay and les- 
bian youth reporting childhood crushes on 
other children and adults. Bell, et al. found 
these sexual feelings typically occurred three 
years or so before any homosexual f^xperien- 
ces and appear to be the most crucial stage in 
the development of adult homosexuality 
(IS). Most children are unaware of the 
meaning and implications of these attrac- 
tions. However, for those who are able to 
make a connection between their "dif- 
ference''~homosexual feelings and gay or les- 
bian identity—depression and suicidal 
feelings may already be present. 

I always knew that I was gay. When 
I was 8 or 9 1 would steal my mother's 
Playgirl magazines and look at the 
pictures of men. I also remember 
seeing heterosexual couples and 
knowing I wasn't like that. I would 
get very depressed about not bemg 
like other kids. Many times I would 
take a kitchen knife and press it 
against my chest, wondering if I 
should push it all the way in (23). 

Many adolescents experiencing conflicts re- 
lated to their sexual orientation report 
having their flrst homosexual experience 
around puberty. Some youth, however, first 
act on their feelings during adolescence. 
Young lesbians tend to have their first ex- 
perience at a later age than young gay males 
(1). Same-sex play and experimentation is 
relatively common prior to puberty with Kin- 
sey reporting that 60 percent of preadoles- 
cent boys and 33 percent of preadolescent 
girls described homosexual play at the time 
they contributed to the study (16,17). Pre- 
homosexual boys and girls often do not have 
a context in which to put their feelings and 
experiences. They have learned to hide 
sexual behavior from adults but have not 
developed an understanding of the stigma at- 
tached to homosexuality. Their initial ex- 
periences tend to confirm homosexual 
feelings. It is now, however, that a terrible 
thing happens to young people who will have 
a gay or lesbian orientation- adolescence. 
Gay aiid lesbian youth will become distin- 



guished from other youth involved in 
preadolescent same-sex play by their 
progress through the developmental stages 
here identified and the persistence of 
homosexual feelings and experiences in spite 
of negative consequences. 

Adolescence 

With adolescence, many gay and lesbian 
youth have their first contact with 
homosexuality and it is all bad. They are told 
it is no longer acceptable to engage in sexual 
behavior with members of the same sex and 
that those who do are sick. The only images 
of homosexuals fhat society provides them 
with are derisive stereotypes of lesbians who 
are like men and gay men who are like 
women. Many experience their first per- 
vasive contact with the fear and hatred of 
homosexuality-homophobia. 

Nowhere are these harshly negative attitudes 
towards homosexuality more pronounced 
than in junior high and high school. These 
institutions are the brutal training grounds 
where traditional social roles are rigidly rein- 
forced. Boys are going to play sports and 
drink beer with the guys. Girls are going to 
start paying more attention to their physical 
appearance in the hop>es of attracting boys. 
Adolescence will be the last stronghold of 
these stereotyped roles and behaviors be- 
cause young people are looking for identity. 
Homosexuality and gender nonconformity 
are threats to many youth and an easy target 
for their fears and anxieties about being "nor- 
mal." 

Youth who have a growing awareness of a gay 
or lesbian orientation become painfully 
aware that they do not fit the "social script." 
They see the hostility directed towards 
homosexuals by others and hear taunts of 
"dyke" and "faggot" used indiscriminately by 
peers. They become alarmed and realize that 
they must make some social adaptation to the 
situation. Martin describes their predica- 
ment: 

In adolescence, young homosexually 
oriented persons are faced with the 



o 

ERIC 



3-117 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



growing awareness that they may be 
among the most despised. .As this 
realization becomes more pressing, 
they are faced with three possible 
choices: they can hide, they can at- 
tempt to change the stigma, or they 
can accept it (24). 

These three adaptations are not mutually ex- 
clusive and are often present in the same in- 
dividual over time. Many youth initially try 
to deny a gay or lesbian orientation to both 
themselves and others. Those adolescents 
who understand and recognize they have a 
gay orientation will continue to hide their 
identity from family and peers for fear of ad- 
verse consequences. Finally, those who be- 
come open about their identity, confront 
those adverse consequences in an effort to 
win acceptance and support. Each adapta- 
tion contains specific problems which con- 
tribute to suicidal feelings and behavior. 

Self Denial 

All young people face tremendous pr/»sures 
to desist from any homosexual behavior and 
develop a heterosexuc* orientation. It is easy 
to see why adolescents with predominantly 
homosexual feelings and experiences would 
try to deny a lesbian or gay identity. They 
have internalized an image of being a 
homosexual as wrong and dangerous to their 
physical and mental health. They have seen 
the stereotypes of lesbians and gay men and 
they don't like them. These youth who don't 
want to live like that decide they are going to 
conform to the social roles and start dating 
members of the opposite sex and become 
heterosexuals. 

Many youth engage in heterosexual sexual 
behavior in an effort to change their orienta- 
tion. This often turns out to be a losing bat- 
tle. Jay and Young found that 83 percent of 
the lesbians and 66 percent of the gay men in 
their survey had previously engaged in 
heterosexual sex (1). Bell and Weinberg 
similarly found that 87 percent of lesbians 
and 68 p)ercent of gay males interviewed had 
pri )r heterosexual experiences (2). Two 
studies with gay male youth found that at 



least 50 percent had prior heterosexual ex- 
periences (5,6). Jay and Young add that 55 
percent of the lesbians and 46 percent ot the 
gay males reported feeling negative about 
these experiences. Bell, et al. in their study 
on the development of sexual orientation 
conclude that: 

The homosexual men and women in 
our study were not particularly lack- 
ing in heterosexual experiences 
during their...adolescent years. They 
are distinguished from their 
heterosexual counterparts, however, 
in finding such experiences un- 
gratifying (15). 

The American Psychiatric Association notes 
in the 1980 edition of the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental disorders (DSM 
III) that "there is a general consensus that 
spontaneous development of a satisfactory 
heterosexual adjustment in individuals who 
previously had a sustained pattern of ex- 
clusively homosexual arousal is rare" (25). 
One potentially serious consequence of this 
heterosexual experimentation is pregnancy 
involving young lesbians or gay males that 
either occurs accidentally or in an effort to 
"prove" a heterosexual orientation. 

Youth who try to change a homosexual 
orientation and are unable to do so ar:? at 
high risk of emotional and behavioral 
problems. They often develop feelings of 
hatred and rage that can be turned against 
themselves or others. They may engage in 
self-destructive behaviors such as substance 
abuse as an unconscious expression of feel- 
ings too painful to face. Others become in- 
volved in verbal and physical attacks against 
other homosexuals as a way of defending 
against their own fears. Finally, when the 
youth comes to recognize for the first time 
that he/she have a primary homosexual 
orientation, overt suicidal behavior may 
result. 

The DSM III includes a new disorder called 
"Ego-Dystonic Homosexuality" which 
describes many of theconflicts faced by youth 
engaged in denial of homosexual feelings

(25). It is characterized by "a desire to ac- 
quire or increase heterosexual arousaL..and 
a sustained pattern of overt homosexual 
arousalM.(that is) unwanted and a persistent 
source of distress.** Associated features in- 
clude guilt) loneliness, shame, anxiety and 
depression. Age of onset occurs in **early 
adolescence when the individual becomes 
aware that he or she is homosexually aroused 
and has already internalized negative feel- 
ings about homosexuality.** The course of the 
illness indicates that **in time, many in- 
dividual5...give up the yearning to become 
heterosexual and accept themselves as 
homosexuals...(with the help) of a supportive 
homosexual subculture.** Remafedi notes 
that the usefulness of this term is still not 
known since distress is so prevalent among 
youth first recognizing a homosexual identity 
(5). However, it clearly identifies a 
phenomena in many young homosexuals that 
places them at a greater risk of taking their 
own lives. 

Those Who Hide 

Many youth are aware of their gay or lesbian 
identity but decide not to be open about it 
and try to pass as **straight** with their families 
and peers. They have seen the negative 
response to homosexuality from society and 
the brutal treatment of gays by their peers. 
Sometimes they have been the recipients of 
verbal or physical abuse as **suspected** 
homosexuals. Martin believes that hiding is 
the primary adaptation for gay and lesbian 
youth (24). He observes that many realize 
that their lives are based on a lie with **the 
socialization of the gay adolescent becoming 
a process of deception at all levels, with the 
ability to play a role.** While remaining in- 
visible to others, the pain and loneliness of 
hiding often causes these youth serious harm 
to their mental health and social develop- 
ment. 

A serious consequence of this adaptation is 
that these youth suffer their fears and low self 
esteem in silence. They are unknown victims 
of scapegoating with every homophobic as- 
sault or remark they witness. They live in 



perpetual fear that their secret will be dis- 
covered. Gay youth become increasingly 
afraid to associate with others and withdraw 
socially in an effort to avoid what they per- 
ceive as a growing number of dangerous 
situations. They spend more and more time 
alone. Aaron Fricke relates the problems of 
hiding a gay identity in his book Reflections 
of a Rock Lobster: A Stofy About Growing Up 
Gay (26). He describes his response to being 
victimized by a homophobic assault as he was 
about to begin high school. 

I began to believe that everyone 
looked down on me and when 
anyone looked at me I thought I saw 
their seething hatred of me coming 
through. When I entered high 
school I was completely isolated from 
the world. I had lost all concept of 
humanity; I had given up all hopes of 
ever finding love, warmth or tender- 
ness. I did not lie to myself, but I did 
keep others from thinking I was 
homosexual I could refuse to ever 
mention my real feelings. That way, 
I would never again suffer the conse- 
quences of being the individual I was. 
I retreated into my own world 

The only goal left to me in life was to 
hide anything that could identify me 
as gay. I became neurotic about this. 
I once heard that gay people talked 
with a lisp. I was horrified when I dis- 
covered that I had a slight lisp, and it 
made me self-conscious about how I 
sounded every time I spoke. Self- 
doubt set in. I thought that anything 
I did might somehow reveal my 
homosexuality, and my morale sank 
even deeper. The more I tried to 
safeguard myself from the outside 
world, the more vulnerable I felt. I 
withdrew from everyone and slowly 
formed a shell around myself. 
Everyone could be a potential threat 
to me. I resembled a crustacean with 
no claws; I had my shell for protec- 
tion yet I would ne^ver do anything to 
hurt someone else. Sitting on a rock

under thousands of pounds of pres- 
sure, surrounded by my enemies, the 
most I could hope for was that no one 
would cause me more harm than my 
shell could endure. 

These youth suffer from chronic depression 
and are at high risk of attempting suicide 
when the pressure becomes too much to 
bear. They may run away from home with no 
one understanding why. A suicidal crisis may 
be precipitated by a minor event which ser- 
ves as a "last straw" to the youth. A low grade 
may confirm for theyouth that life is a failure. 
An unwitting homophobic remark by parents 
may be taken to mean that the youth is no 
longer loved by them. 

Martin also believes this adaptation hinders 
the social development of gay and lesbian 
youth (24). There is an absence of social out- 
lets for gay youth that makes it veiy difficult, 
for them to meet others like themselves. 
Th^ shy away from attachments to friends 
for fear of getting too involved or experienc- 
ing rejection. Open relationships or displays 
of affection with others of the same sex is not 
tolerated in the gay youth's home and social 
environment, making extreme secrecy a re- 
quirement in developing romantic attach- 
ments. (Indeed, these issues form the 
essence of discrimination against 
homosexuals in our society.) Consequently, 
lesbian and gay youth do not learn how to es- 
tablish and maintain intimate relationships in 
the way heterosexual youth do. 

Young gay males often experience their 
same-sex relationships as casual sexual con- 
tacts with strangers. Because of their age, 
many of these encounters occur in clandes- 
tine meeting places where gay males con- 
'gregate. Roesler and Deisher found that 76 
percent of their subjects had met sexual 
partners in parks, 62 percent in theaters, and 
32 percent in restrooms (6). Remafedi found 
that 63 percent of young gay males he sur- 
veyed had met other males in gay bars; only 
28 percent said they had known their partner 
for a week prior to hciving sex (5). Martin ex- 
presses concern that these encounters condi- 
tion the young gay male to respond to other 



gay males on a sexual level only. 

He often haj not had the opportunity 
to develop courting behaviors other 
than direct sexual contact. 
Heterosexual adolescents learn to 
date and go through a series of socie- 
tally ordained procedures with sexual 
contact as a possible end result. The 
young gay male often learns to start 
with the end result, sexual behavior, 
and then attempts to develop the 
relationship (24). 

Young gay mr'es face the risk of mistaking 
sexual feelings for deeper bonds of love. 
Thc> .nay despair of the difficulties in form- 
ing lasting relationships on the basis of fleet- 
ing sexual encounters. Suicidal feelings may 
follow the failure of casual sex to meet the 
youth's needs of intimacy and belonging. 

Young lesbians are even more isolated than 
young gay males in their efforts to form in- 
timate relationships. There are few meeting 
places for lesbians in our society and casual 
sexual contacts are a less frequent part of 
their development. Lewis writes that: 

Because women ^re socialized to 
have and maintain relationships, 
sexual exploration and experimenta- 
tion often takes place within the con- 
text of a relationship (22). 

With fewer social opportunities, however, 
young lesbians are often not able to form in- 
itial relationships with lovers until later 
adolescence or young adulthood. Suicidal 
feelings among young lesbians may be due to 
the extreme isolation they experience and 
the despa'r of being unable to meet others 
like themselves. 

Openly Gay and Lesbian Youth 

Those who accept their orientation and are 
open about it wi '^ others form a smaller but 
visible segment of the lesbian and gay male 
youth population. They learn that only part 
of developing an identity as a gay male or les- 
bian is coming to understand and accept your 
sexual orientation. Now they must find out 



3-120 



1?5 



P.Gibson: Gay Male and Lesbian Youth Suicide 



what their place is and where they belong 
within the confines of the traditional social 
structure available to them. There are few 
role models to emulate and society offers 
them little support in this process. Gay youth 
usually don't begin to be open about their 
orientation until middle to late adolescence. 

Many of these youth will have an atypical so- 
cial role that includes gender nonconformity. 
Bell, et al. found that 62 percent of lesbians 
surveyed described themselves as "very mas- 
culine" while growing up (15). Remafedi 
found more than half of young gay males in- 
terviewed saw themselves as "less masculine" 
than their peers (5). Gender nonconformity 
may be more pronounced in youth first open- 
ly identifying themselves as gay. Sometimes 
it is a natural and permanent expression of 
who they are and sometimes it is a transition- 
al process youth go through in learning that 
they don't have to behave in any particular 
way to be gay. Weinberg and Williams found 
that younger gay males identified themselves 
as effeminate three times more frequently 
than did older gay males (27). 

Gender nonconformity in gay youth may 
reflect natural qualities that do not fit cul- 
tural stereotypes (e.g., men who are gentle, 
women who are strong). Youth may have ex- 
pressed these attributes since childhood and 
will continue to do so as adults. Gender non- 
conformity may also fit the expectations that 
society sets for gay and lesbian youth. Gay 
youth are especially susceptible to cultural 
stereotypes while struggling to find an ap- 
propriate identity. One young gay male told 
me that he literally thought that he had to be 
"like a girl" because he was gay. There is not 
a diversity of gay male and lesbian adult role 
models for gay youth to pattern themselves 
after. For many young lesbians and gay men, 
the earliest images of adults they thought 
were homosexuals were people who fit the 
traditional stereotypes. 

One young lesbian recalled when she 
was a child there was a "tough look- 
ing" woman with a siight moustache 
who drove a pick-up truck and lived 
on the edge of town by herself. This 



woman was ostracized by the rest of 
the town and rumored to be a lesbian. 
The little girl both wondered and 
feared if she would grow up to be like 
her. 

Martin maintains that discrimination 
prevents adults from being more open about 
their homosexuality thus denying "suitable 
role models to gay adolescents who could 
demonstrate by example, sharii>g, and teach- 
ing that existing prejudices are false" (24). 
This is especially true for gay adults who work 
with children and adolescents. 

Gender nonconformity may Anally be a con- 
scious effort to reject traditional roles and es- 
tablish a separate and viable identity. One 
young lesbian told me she threw away her 
dolls in disgust when she was a child. It is not 
unusual for individuals sharing a common 
identity to separate themselves from others 
by establishing particular behaviors, ap- 
pearances, terminology and interests. Ef- 
feminacy in young gay males and masculinity 
in young lesbians is often a way for them to 
affirm a homosexual identity and assist them 
in finding each other. According to Wolf, 
culturally defined masculine attire is "more 
strongly assumed by young women who are 
r.< aware of their lesbianism and looking 
foi a community" (22). 

Gay and lesbian youth take tremendous risks 
by being open about who they are. You have 
to respect their courage. They remain at high 
risk to suicidal feelings and behavior because 
of the pressures they face in conflicts with 
others about their homosexual orientation 
and the disappointments they experience at 
the initial hardships of an openly gay and les- 
bian lifestyle. Rofes warns that no myth is 
more dangerous to gay adolescents than the 
notion that "coming out" will insure them 
against feelings of self-destructivcness (19). 

The immediate conflicts that openly gay 
youth face are with their peers and family. 
Openly homoscxua' youth are an affront to a 
society that would like to believe they don't 
exist. Our culture seems to have particular 
disdain for those gay youth who do not con- 



3-121 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



form to gender expectations. Rejection or 
abuse can become so intense that suicidal 
feelings and behavior result. Openly gay 
youth are divmic likely to be forced to leave 
their schools and families and survive on their 
own. 

Those gay youth forced to become self sufH- 
cient prematurely fmd that they face the dis- 
crimination of society against both youth and 
homosexuals in trying to do so. Often these 
youth have not had vocational training and 
some have not completed their secondary 
education. They are discriminated against in 
finding housing and employment because of 
their sexual orientation. Perhaps most disap- 
pointing, gay youth fmd they often cannot 
depend on help from adult gay males and les- 
bians in getting established because of the 
fears adult homosexuals have of being seen 
as "recruiting" young people. Gay youth 
often become involved with a small and un- 
stable population of gay males and lesbians 
living on the streets. Here, they are at high 
risk at substance abuse, sexually transmitted 
diseases, and unstable relationships. The 
hardships of this lifestyle combined with the 
early rejection by family and peers may result 
in a suicide attempt. 

One young gay male involved in pros- 
titution attempted suicide after 
receiving a "hate" letter from his 
parents. In it his mother said she was 
sorry she had not gotten an abortion 
before he was bom and his father said 
that he only had half of a son. The 
youn;^, man completed suicide two 
years later. 

A fmal area of difficulty for openly lesbian 
and gay male youth is in the forming and 
maintenance of intimate relationships with 
others. Having a lover is frequently a new ex- 
perience for gay youth. Lewis writes: 

The lesbian's exploration of intimate 
experiences with other women is an 
emotionally turbulent process. It is, 
essentially, a second adolescence, 
complete with many of the symptoms 
common to the mainstream 



heterosexual adolescent period (22). 

The lack of experience that youth bring to 
these relationships is compounded by the 
need for secrecy and lack of social supports 
for dealing with conflicts so common in 
homosexual relationships. These first 
romantic involvements often assume a dis- 
proportionate importance in the youth's life. 
They serve to both affirm a lesbian or gay 
orientation and also fill unmet needs for love, 
caring, and friendship that have often been 
missing in the youth's life. When the 
relationship ends, gay youth sometimes feel 
no one cares and nothing is left to live for. 

Ethnic Minority Gay Youth 

Ethnic minority youth (i.e., Black, Hispanic, 
Asian, and American Indian) comprise a sub- 
stantial number of youth who are gay, les- 
bian, bisexual, or transsexual. Ruth Hughes, 
Coordinator of Gay Youth Services at the 
Center for Special Problems in San Francis- 
co, rep ns that these youth face more severe 
social and cultural oppression than other gay 
youth and far more serious problems than 
other adolescents (29). Bell and Weinberg 
found that black gay males and lesbians at- 
tempted or seriously considered suicide at a 
rate less than white homosexuals but greater 
than black heterosexuals (2). However, they 
found that a higher percentage of suicide at- 
tempts by black homosexuals took place 
during their youth. 36 percent of black les- 
bians compared to 21 percent of white les- 
bians and 32 percent of black gay males 
compared to 27 percent of white gay males 
attempted suicide before age 18. This indi- 
cates that black gay youth may face particular 
hardships during adolescence. 

Ethnic minority gay youth face all of the 
problems that other gay and lesbian youth 
face growing up in a hostile and condemning 
society. They also face the same economic 
discrimination and prejudice confronted by 
other ethnic minority youth because of 
racism. Davis notes a dramatic increase in 
suicides among young blacks over the past 
two decades that has brought their suicide 
rate nearly equal to that of white youths (30). 

1P7 



er|c ^■■'^ 



.. . . ..... . 

P.Gibson: Gay Male and Lesbian Youth Suicide 



Hendin, in his bool^ Black Suicide, offers an 
^lanation: 

It does not seem surprising that 
suicide becomes a problem at such a 
relatively early age for the black per- 
son. A sense of despair, a feeling that 
life will never be satisfying, confronts 
many blacks at a far younger age than 
it does rnfjst whites (31). 

Ethnic minority gay youth additionally face 
racial discrimination from white 
homosexuals that is a reflection of their treat- 
ment by the majority culture. Dutton writes 
that the gay liberation movement has often 
failed to consider the needs of ethnic 
minorities while ignoring their issues and 
concerns (32). Jones adds that: 

Little has been written about Third World 
sexual minorities, and when generaliiies were 
made about our lifestyles, attitudes, and be- 
haviors, they were often made in reference 
to white cultures-white cultures being the 
basis for Third World cultures to deviate 
from or strive for (33). 

Finally, ethnic minority gay youth must con- 
tend with discrimination and special 
problems from their own ethnic group be- 
cause of their sexual orientation. Hughes 
believes that ostracism and separation from 
their own ethnic group is particularly painful 
and difficult for these youth to cope with: 

They expect acceptance by those like 
themselves who understand and have 
experienced oppression. Too often, 
blacks don't want to face the issue 
and see homosexuality as a struggle 
for white gay males. Ethnic minority 
gay youth are seen as an "embarrass- 
ment" to their cultural group. There 
is more concern for daily survival is- 
sues than an increased under- 
standing of homosexuality (29). 

Jones adds that: 

Lesbians and gays growing up in 
Third World communities ex- 
perience just as much, if not more, 
oppression as heterosexual minority 



youth do in non-Third World com- 
munities. Unfortunately, most of the 
negative attitudes and oppressions 
bestowed upon lesbians and gays in 
Third World cultures are reactions to 
the influence that mainstream white 
culture has on it (33). 

Two issues that strongly effect ethnic 
minority gay youth are religion and the fami- 

ly. 

Ethnic minority cultures have V <itorically 
believed that homosexuality is a s'.a accord- 
ing to the faiths to which they predominant- 
ly belong. Parents frequently use religion as 
the standard to evaluate homosexuality. A 
homosexual orientation in their son or 
daughter becomes incompatible with 
religious beliefs. Ethnic minority gay youth 
often internalize these religious values and 
feel guilty for having homosexual feelings 
and experiences, fearing they are condemned 
to hell. 

The family also plays a central role in the lives 
of these youth with strong expectations that 
th^ will fulfill social roles and perpetuate the 
extended family. A homosexual orientation 
is sometimes seen as 2. sign of disrespect to 
the family by the youth and a threat to the 
family's survival. 

Ethnic minority gay youth have tremendous 
fears of losing their extended family and 
being alone in the world. This fear is made 
greater by the isolation they already face in 
our society as people of color. These ethnic 
minority gay youth who are rejected by 
families are at risk of suicide because of the 
tremendous pressures they face being gay 
and a person of color in a white homophobic 
society. 

Transsexual Youth 

Transsexual youth are perhaps the most out- 
cast of all young people and face a grave risk 
of suicidal feelings and behavior. Huxdly and 
Brandon found that 53 percent of 72 
transsexuals surveyed had made suicide at- 
tempts (34). Harry feels that "transsexuals 
may be at higher risk than homosexuals and 




IPS 



3-123 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



much higher risk than the general popula- 
tion" to suicidal behavior (35). IVanssonial 
youth believe they have a gender identity dif- 
ferent from the sex th^ were bom with. 
They often manifest this belief beginning in 
childhood through an expressed desire to be 
a person of the opposite gender, repudiation 
of their genitalia, gender nonconformity and 
cross dressing (25). These behaviors may 
subside by adolescence due to extreme pres- 
sures to conform to social expectations. 
Some transsexual youth, however, try to 
"pass" in junior high and high school as a per- 
son of the opposite sex or engage in increas- 
ingly pronounced behaviors that do not 
conform to gender expectations. These 
adaptations present serious internal and ex- 
ternal conflicts fo7 these youth. 

All transsexuals are vulnerable to internaliz- 
ing an extremely negative image of themsel- 
ves. They experience tremendous internal 
conflict between this image and their persist- 
ent desire to become the person they believe 
they are. Heller notes that suicidal 
transsexuals tend to feel hopelessly trapped 
in their situation (36). These feelings may be 
particularly pronounced in young 
transsexuals who are forced to hide their 
identity. While wanting to change their sex, 
th^ are seldom able to do so and feel con- 
demned to a life they are convinced is a mis- 
take. The DSM III notes that transsexuals 
frequently experience "considerable anxiety 
and depression, which the individual may at- 
tribute to inability to live in the role of the 
desired sex" (25). This depression combined 
with a poor self esteem can easily result in 
suicidal feelings and behavior in transsexual 
youth. 

.Some transsexual youth, however, make in- 
creasingly braver attempts to live as a person 
of the opposite sex. They experience con- 
flicts in making a social adaptation to their 
believed identity. Many young transsexuals 
will adapt the most stereotyped roles and be- 
haviors traditionally associated with being a 
"male" and a "female" in our society. Like 
other youth, they are trying to defme them- 
selves by rigid adherence to these roles. 



Sometimes transsexual youth experience 
problems similar to this: 

A young transsexual male was ar- 
rested for soliciting an undercover 
police officer while in drag. He was 
taken to juvenile hall where he ex- 
perienced anxiety and confusion 
around his role in the unit with other 
boys. One time he reported it was his 
duty as the "onty girl" to provide the 
other boys with sexual favors. 
Another time he broke down crying 
feeling as though he was being used 
and abused by the other males. A 
week later he made a suicuie at- 
tempt. 

Transsexual youth who are open about their 
identity face extreme abuse and rejection 
from families and peers. Many are forced to 
leave their home communities and survive on 
the streets. Their prognosis in our society is 
poor and they are at high risk of suicide. 
Gender dysphoria is a disorder that we have 
little understanding of and a great deal of 
repulsion for. The only known course of 
treatment is to help transsexuals to adjust to 
their believed gender identity and obtain sex- 
reassignment surgery. Most transsexual 
youth, however, are unable to obtain or af- 
ford the help they need in resolving their 
identity conflicts. 

It is important to distinguish between 
transsexual youth and gay and lesbian youth 
who do not conform to gender expectations. 
Gender nonconformity is common among 
gay youth in both childhood and adolescence. 
Some gay and lesbian youth may experience 
gender identity confusion during adoles- 
cence in the coming out process because of 
the intense social pressures for gay males to 
be like women and lesbians to be like man. 
Gay youth may feel they actually have to be 
a person of the oppasite gender to meet 
those expectations. Hughes, in her work 
with both homosexual and transsexual youth, 
emphasizes the importance of working with 
a young person over a period to time todeter- 
mine if they are truly a transsexual (29). Gay 
and lesbian youth come to recognize that 



3-124 



they neither want to change their sex nor live 
as a person of the opposite gender. 

RISK FACTORS IN GAY AND 
LESBIAN YOUTH SUICIDE 

Oay young people face the same risk factors 
for suicidal behavior that effect other youth. 
These include family problems, breaking up 
with a lover, social isolation, school failure, 
and identity conflicts. However, these fac- 
tors assume greater importance when the 
youth has a gay or lesbian orientation. Jay 
and Young found that 53 percent of gay 
males and 33 percent of lesbians surveyed 
believed their suicide attempts involved their 
homosexuality (1). Bell and Weinberg 
report that 58 percent of gay males and 39 
percent of lesbians felt their first suicide at- 
tempts were related to the fact that they were 
homosexuals (2). Suicide attempts by gay 
and lesbian youth are even more likely to in- 
volve conflicts around their sexual orienta- 
tion because of the overwhelming pressures 
they face in coming out at an early age. 

General 

Bell and Weinberg found that initial suicide 
attempts related to homosexuality more fre- 
quently involved acceptance of self and con- 
flicts with others for gay males, while lesbians 
tended to cite problems with lovers as the 
reason (2). Self acceptance may be especial- 
ly critical for young gay males who tend to 
have homosexual experiences and are aware 
of their orientation at a somewhat earlier age 
than lesbians (1,15). Conflicts with others 
may be more salient for young gay males 
"identifiv'd" as homosexuals. Gender non- 
conformity elicits a negative response from 
others for lesbian and gay male youth, but 
society seems to have particular disdain for 
effeminate young males. Young lesbians 
may experience more extreme social isola- 
tion, often reporting an absence of same-sex 
experiences or knowing others like them 
during adolescence. They ako face stronger 
social pressures to fulfill the woman's tradi- 
tional role of marrying and having children 
and may experience more depression related 



to not meeting social expectations. Problems 
with lovers may be especially critical for 
young lesbians bi/cause their sexuality is 
often explored within the context of their 
early intimate relationships. 

The earlier a youth is aware of a gay or les- 
bian orientation, the greater the problems 
they face and more likely the risk of suicidal 
feelings and behavior. Remafedi observes 
that: 

Younger gay adolescents may be at 
the highest risk for dysfunction be- 
cause of emotional and physical im- 
maturity, unfulfilled developmental 
needs for identification with a peer 
group, lack of experience, and de- 
pendence on parents unwilling or un- 
able to provide emotional support 
(5). 

He adds that younger gay adolescents are 
more likely to abuse substances, drop out of 
school, be in conflict with the law, undergo 
psychiatric hospitalization, run away from 
home, be involved in prostitution, and at- 
tempt suicide. The Los Angeles Suicide 
Prevention Center recently found that the 
strongest causative indicators of suicidal be- 
havior among gay youth were awareness of 
their sexual orientation, depression and 
suicidal feelings, and substance abuse-all 
before age 14 (7). A 14 year old gay male in- 
terviewed for this paper confirms that 
profile: 

When I was 11, I started smoking 
dope, drinking alcohol, and snorting 
speed every day to make me feel bet- 
ter and forget I was gay. I would 
party with friends but get more and 
more dc*pressed as the night would go 
on. They would always make anti- 
gay remarks and harass gay men 
while I woulr^ just stand there. Late 
at night, ai they went home, I 
would go down to the river and dive 
in-ho^uig I would hit my head on a 
rock and drown (23).

Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



Society 

It is a sobering fact to realize that we are the 
greatest risk factors in gay youth suicide. No 
group of people are more strongly affected 
by the attitudes and conduct of society than 
are the young. Gay and lesbian youth are 
strongly affected by the negative attitudes 
and hortile responses of society to 
homosexuality. The resulting poor self-es- 
teem, depr^jssion, and fear can be a fatal blow 
to a fragile identity. Two ways that society in- 
fluences suicidal behavior 1^ gay and lesbian 
youth are: 1) the ongoing discrimination 
against and oppression of homosexuals, and 
2) the portrayal of homosexuals as being self- 
destructive. 

It is the response of our society as a whole to 
homosexuality, and specifically those institu- 
tions and significant others responsible for 
their care, that pose the greatest risk to gay 
and lesbian youth. Gock believes that 
homophobia, the irrational fear and -fid 
of homosexuals, is the root of the pro 'em 
(37). Gay males and lesbians are still routine- 
ly the victims of violence by others. In a 
recent survey of nearly 2,100 lesbians and gay 
men nationwide, the National Gay Task 
Force found that more than 90 percent had 
been victims of verbal and physical assault be- 
'.SiiioC of their sexual orientation (10). Tacit 
and explicit discrimination against 
homosexuals is still pervasive in virtually ail 
areas of life. Half of the States still prohibit 
homosexual re' itionships between consent- 
ing adults (3/). Homosexuals are not al- 
lovred to legally marry 'dnd form legitimate" 
long-term relationships. The vast majority of 
States and municipalities still discriminate 
against lesbians and gay men in housing, 
employm(!;nt and other areas. Gay and les- 
bian yoL.h see this and take it to heart. 

Rofes warns us against the myth that 
homosexuality, in and of itself, encourages 
suicide (13). There is nothing inherently 
self-destructive in homosexual feelings and 
relationships that could be a source of 
suicidal behavior. In his book, / Thou^ 
I'eople Like That Killed Themselves Rofes 
maintains we have r.reated a stereotyped 



image of the unhappy homosexual in litera- 
ture and the media (e.g.. Boys in the Sand) 
for which suicide is the only appropriate 
resolution. This image is reinforced by the 
fact that homosexual characters in novels and 
films invariably kill themselves in the end. 
The myth is perpetuated by the absence of 
positive adult gay role models in our society 
where, historically, the only known 
homosexuals were those «qx)sed by scandal 
and disgraced in their communities. Rofes 
maintains this creates a strong negative con- 
text for the early identity fon.*.ation of young 
gay males and lesbians effectively socializing 
them into su^sidal feelings and behavior. He 
sees a strong correlation between sexual 
orientation, social response to that sexual 
orientation, and subsequent suicidality in an 
individual. 

Self Estviem 

A predisposlnr factor in suicidal feelings 
among many adolescents is poor self esteem. 
This is especially true for gay adolescents 
who have internalized a harshly negative 
image of being bad and wrong from society, 
religion, family, and peers. For youth, a r^r 
self-image contributes substantiallv to a lack 
of confidence in being able to cope with 
problems. The images of homosexuals as 
sick and self-destructive have inipact on the 
coping skills of gay youth, rendering them 
helpless and unable to improve their situa- 
tion. Gay youth who have internalized a mes- 
sage throughout their lives of being worthless 
and unable to cope from abusive and chaotic 
families are at even greater risk. 

Youth with a poor self-esteem and poor 
coping skills are particularly vulnerable to 
suicidal feelings when confronting a problem 
for the first time. Th^ really don't know how 
to resolve it or even if they can. Gay youth 
are highly susceptible to suicidal feelings 
during the "coming out" process when first 
facing their own homosexuality and the hos- 
tile response it evokes in others. They may 
aUempt suicide when they first realize they 
have homosexual feelings or a gay orienta- 
tion. Some youth deny their homosexual 



3-126 



131 



P.Gibson: Gay Male and Lesbian Youth Suicide 



feelings and engage in unconscious self- 
destructive behavior out of self hatred. 
Others tiy to "change" their orientation and 
make a suicide attempt when they recognize 
their homosexuality will not go away and is 
part of who they are. 

Many youth realize they are gay or lesbian 
but attempt to hide their orientation from 
others. They suffer from chronic loneliness 
and depression. They may attempt suicide 
because th^ feel trapped in their situation 
and believe th^ do not deserve to live. A 
suicidal gesture may be a cry for help from 
these youth for others to recognize and un- 
derstand their situation. Finally, those youth 
who are open about being gay, lesbian, or 
bisexual face continuous conflict with their 
environment. Th^ remain vulnerable to 
suicide because the)' face these extreme pres- 
sures with a m jre fragile sense of self worth 
and ability to cope with life than other youth. 

Family 

Family problems a."f probably the most sig- 
nificant factor in youth suicide. Youth derive 
their core sense of being cared about and 
belonging from their families. Gay youth 
may make suicide attempts after being 
rejected by their families. For gay and les- 
bian youth forced to leave home, the loss of 
parental love and support remains a critical 
issue for them. Sometimes the youth's sexual 
orientation becomes a convenient excuse for 
parents to reject a son or daughter they did 
not want. Youth from abusive and dysfunc- 
tional families are at even greater risk. 
Wandrei found, in comparing suicide at- 
tempts by lesbians and heterosexual women, 
that lesbians were more likely to come from 
broken homes (39). 

Gay and lesbian youth face more verbal and 
physical abuse from family members than do 
other youth. The National Gay Task Force 
found that more than 33 percent of gay males 
and lesbians reported verbal abuse from rela- 
tives because of their orientation and 7 per 
cent reported physical abuse as well (AO). 
These figures are substantially higher for 
youth open about their sexual orientation 



while still living at home. Sometimes this 
harassment becomes too much to bear for 
gay youth and a suicide attempt results. 

Gay and lesbian youth may feel suicidal be- 
cause of a failure to meet family expectations. 
All youth need approval torn their parents. 
Some youth report only feeling loved by 
parents when they are fiilfilUng their parents 
image of who th^ should be. Gay youth 
often feel they can not meet their parents 
standards and may attempt suicide after real 
or anticipated disappointment by their 
families that th^ will not fit the social script 
of heterosexual marriage and grandchildren. 
This pressure is particularly strong for les- 
bians. Gay youth fear they will not have 
families of their own and be alone as adults 
with no one to care for them. 

Communication problems also play a serious 
role in family issues for gay youth. Many les- 
bian and gay youth hide their orientation 
from their parents out of fear of rejection. 
They have often seen a strong negative reac- 
tion to homosexuality by parents and siblings 
including homophobic remarks. The an- 
ticipated inevitable loss of love can 
precipitate a suicide attempt. Parris related 
a call to a suicide hotline in Washington, 
D.C.: 

The youth said that he was gay and 
wanted to talk with his parents about 
it but was afraid because they weie 
very religious. A week later, a man 
called...to say his son had committed 
suicide. Th^ were calling an un- 
familiar number on their long dis- 
tance phone bill. By matching the 
man's address<..the tragic connection 
was made (19). 

Religion 

Religion presents another risk factor in gay 
youth suicide because of the depiction of 
homosexuality as a sin and the reliance of 
families on the church for understanding 
homosexuality. M^ny traditional (e.g., 
Catholicism) and fundamentalist (e.g., Bap- 
tist) faiths still portray homosexuality as 

1,12 

3-127 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



morally wrong or evil. Family religious 
beliefs can be a primary reason for parents 
forcing youth to leave home if a homosexual 
orientation is seen as incompatible with 
church teachings. These belieb can also 
create unresoWable internal conflicts for gay 
youth who adhere to their faith but believe 
they will not change their sexual orientation. 
They may feel wicked and condemned to hell 
and attempt suicide in despair of ever obtain- 
ing redemption. 

School 

Many gay and lesbian youth feel trapped in 
school settings because of a compulsory 
obligation to attend and the inability to 
defend themselves against verbal and physi- 
cal assaults. Schools do not adequately 
protect gay youth with teachers often reluc- 
tant to stop harassment or rebut homophobic 
remarks for fear of being seen as undesirable 
role models (19). Verbal and physical attacks 
against gay youth have increased in recent 
years as students become increasingly 
threatened by the presence and openness of 
peers with a lesbian or gay orientation. This 
abuse begins as early as late elementary 
school, becomes pronounced in junior high 
when youth are still immature, and continues 
into high school. The failure of schools to ad- 
dress this concern can be tragic: 

In Lebanon, Pennsylvania in 1977, a 
16-year old boy fatally shot himself 
before entering the 10th grade. He 
left a suicide note explaining he 
could not return to school and sus- 
tain the abuse and ridicule about 
being gay from his classmates. A few 
friends at school supported (him) 
though they knew he was gay, but the 
majority ridiculed him without 
mercy. He skipped classes to avoid 
the torture and welcomed .e sum- 
mer vacation as a respite. But he was 
already taking pills to escape the 
reality of the approach of another 
school term, when he would have to 
move from junior high to the even 
more sharply defined roles of senior 



high. On September 3 he shared that 
anxiety with a friend anc! on Septem- 
ber S he shot and killed himself (40). 

The failure of schools to educate youth about 
homosexuality presents another risk factor to 
gay and lesbian adolescents. By ignoring the 
subject in all curricula, includUig family life 
classes, the schools deny access to positive in- 
formation about homosexuality that could 
improve the self esteem of gay youth. They 
also perpetuate myths and stereotypes that 
condemn homosexuality and deny youth ac- 
cess to positive adult lesbian and gay role 
models. This silence provides tacit support 
for homophobic attitudes and conduct by 
some students. 

Social Isolation 

Social isolation has been consistently iden- 
tified as one of the most critical factors in 
suicide attempts by youth. The isolation and 
alienation young people experience in all 
aspects of their lives can be overwhelming. 
Those youth hiding their identity often 
withdraw from family and friends out of fear 
of being discovered. They feel there is no 
one they can talk to and no one who will un- 
derstand. Tartagni, based on his experience 
teaching in public school, writes that "one of 
the loneliest people in any high school in 
America is the rejected and isolated gay 
adolescent" (41). This isolation may be more 
extreme for young lesbians who often report 
a total lack of contact with others like them- 
selves during high school. Joanne, in One 
Teenager in Ten, describes her feelings after 
realizing her lesbianism in adolescence: 

In October, I realized my lesbianism 
and I did not have someone gay to 
talk with. I recall the anguish I suf- 
fered looking back over my journal 
during that time period. "Please. 
Help me. Oh shit, I have to talk with 
someone...I have to tell someone, ask 
someone. WHO??!! Dammit all, 
would someone please help me? 
Someone, anyone. Help me. I'm 
going to kill myself if they don't" (28).

P.Gibson: Gay Male and Lesbian Youth Suicide 



Openly gay youth experience blatant rejec- 
tion and isolation from others. One young 
gay male related that his parents refused to 
eat at the dinner table with him after they 
learned he was gay. Maid peers cruelly 
separate themseWes from young gay males 
with jokes about not wanting to get AIDS. 
Gay youth frequently do not have contact 
with other gay adolescents or adults for sup- 
port. Parents often forbid them from as- 
sociating with people they "suspect" or know 
to be homosexuals. Youth service workers 
often feel uncomfortable talking with gay 
young people because of their prejudices and 
lack of understanding for who they are. The 
Los Angeles Suicide Prevention Center, in 
their recent study on gay youth suicide, ironi- 
cally found that gay young people rated so- 
cial support as being very important to them 
while simultaneously experiencing people as 
being more rejecting of them than did other 
youth (7). 

Substance Abuse 

Some gay and lesbian young people cope 
with the mai^ problems they face by using al- 
cohol and drugs. The age of onset for sub- 
stance use among all youth has become lower 
in recent years and in 1985 is estimated to be 
11.9 years for boys and 12.7 years for girls 
(42). This coincides with the age that many 
youth are becoming aware of a gay or lesbian 
orientation. Rofes found that lesbians and 
gay men have a higher rate of substance 
abuse than heterosexuals and found this to 
be correlated with increased suicidal feelings 
and behavior (13). 

Gay youth are especially susceptible to sub- 
stance abuse in trying to cope with the con- 
flicts of the coming out process. Remafedi 
believes there may be a higher rate of sub- 
stance abuse among gay youth than among 
gay adults (5). He found that 58 percent of 
young gay males he interviewed could be 
classified as having a substance abuse disor- 
der in the DSM III. Gay youth forced to live 
on the streets experience more severe drug 
problems. The Larkin Street Youth Center 
in San Francisco reported ihat more than 75 



percent of their clients identified as gay had 
serious and chronic disorders (8). The Los 
Angeles Suicide Prevention Center found a 
strong correlation between substance abuse 
and suicide attempts among gay young 
people (7). 

Professional Help 

Perhaps no risk factor is as insidious or uni- 
que to the suicidal behavior of gay and les- 
bian youth than receiving professional help. 
The large number of gay youth who have had 
contact with mental health and social work 
services during their turbulent adolescent 
years would seem to be a positive indicator 
for improving their stability and future out- 
look. This is sadly not often the case. Many 
helping professionals still refuse to recognize 
or accept a homosexual orientation in youth 
despite growing evidence that sexual orien- 
tation is formed by adolescence (15). They 
refuse to support a homosexual orientation 
in youth despite the fact that homosexuality 
is no longer viewed as a mental disorder (25). 
They continue to insist that homosexual feel- 
ings are just a passing "phase", while making 
the goal of treatment arresting cr changing 
those feelings and experiences. Martin poin - 
tedly describes this process: 

Pain and su^ering are inflicted on 
the very young, whom society is sup- 
posedly protecting, under the guise 
of preventing the spread of 
homosexuality or of treating the in- 
dividual (24). 

He adds that some psychiatrists even advo- 
cate creating conflict, guilt and anxiety in 
adolescents concerned about homosexual 
feelings where none has previously existed. 

Youth who deny their feelings and ex- 
perience "ego-dystonic homosexuality" are 
especially vulnerable to this type of adverse 
treatment. Rather than helping these youth 
to accept and understand predominantly 
homosexual feelings and experiences, we see 
their denial as a "hopeful" sign that they can 
still develop a heterosexual orientation. 
When homosexual feelings persist after

Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



treatment has attempted to change them, the 
youth despairs and is at potentially greater 
risk for suicide than if we tried to help 
him/her towards acceptance. 

Youth who are aware of their lesbian or gay 
orientation but hide it from others, may seek 
help without identifying their concerns about 
their sexuality. We often do not recognize 
these youth because we don't acknowledge 
they exist. We are uncomfortable in discuss- 
ing or addressing the issue and consequently 
are unable to identify or resolve the source 
of the youth's conflicts. A suicide attempt 
may be an effort by the youth to force the 
issue and bring it to our attention. It may also 
be an act of despair over a problem that they 
feel can not be addressed through profes- 
sional help. 

Even openly gay and lesbian youth are sub- 
jected to treatment with potentially adverse 
effects. Frequently, informing family and 
counselors that a youth is gay is the impetus 
for imposed treatment. We assume that the 
youth's gay orientation is the source of the 
problem rather than the response of others 
to his/her being lesbian or gay. Encouraging 
these youth to change can cause regression 
in the development of a healthy gay identity 
and reinforce traditional stereotypes of 
homosexuals as sick and self destructive. 
This, in turn, further weakens the youth's 
self-esteem and ability to cope with 
problems. Even those professionals who ac- 
cept the youth as gay or lesbian are often un- 
able to support the youngster in dealing with 
conflicts at home and in school. 

Youth Programs 

There is a critical lack of program resources 
for gay and lesbian youth. Many social and 
recreational programs for youth make no ef- 
fort to incorporate gay young people into 
their services. Few programs will accept or 
support a gay adolescent in their sexual 
orientation. Agency policies tacitly or ex- 
plicitly forbid the hi)ing of openly gay and les- 
bian staff, denying gay youth access to 
positive adult gay role models. Homophobic 
remarks and attitudes by youth and staff in 



3-130 



many ofthese programs go unrebutted. Con- 
sequently, gay youth do not use many of the 
youth service resources available to them or 
soon leave if they do. This increases their so- 
cial isolation and alienation from their peers. 

Other gay and lesbian youth who are wards 
of the juvenile court have little choice but to 
live in those placements to which they are 
referred. Here, they re-experience many of 
the problems they had in their home com- 
munities. Many foster families are rejecting 
of gay and lesbian youth, feeling less invest- 
ment than a youth's natural family to keep- 
ing the youth in the home. Gay male and 
lesbian adults are prohibited in most States 
from being foster parents with gay youth 
again denied access to supportive adults who 
could serve as positive role models for them. 

Group home placements present special 
hardships for gay youth because abusive 
peers often live in the same home with them. 
Those programs without an on-site school re- 
quire gay youth to return to public school for 
their education. Program staff have seldom 
received training on issues and concerns re- 
lated to homosexuality. They are frequently 
unable to understand or work with gay youth 
effectively. Group homes become a living 
hell of harassment, isolation, and confUcts 
with other staff and residents offering gay 
youth little support and no resolution. A 
suicide attempt may be an effort to force 
removal from the placement and find a dif- 
ferent home. Many homes, however, will not 
accept gay youth and few offer specialized 
services to meet their needs. 

Relationships with Lovers 

We are all victims of the myth that our first 
love will be our one true love until death do 
us part (e.g., Romeo and Juliet). Young 
people are especially vulnerable to this mis- 
conception and breaking up with a lover is 
one of the most frequent reasons for their 
suicide attempts. The first romantic involve- 
ments of lesbian and gay male youth are a 
source of great joy to them in affirming their 
sexual identity, providing them with support, 
and assuring them that they too can ex- 



135 



P.Gibson: Gay Male and Lesbian Youth Suicide 



perience love. L .«*' >«r, society places ex- 
treme hardships on ^^^^se relationships that 
make them difficult to establish and main- 
tain. Bell and Weinberg foucd that relation- 
ship problems were the ngle most 
frequently cited reason for the initial suicide 
attempts of lesbians (62%) and gay males 
(42%)(2). 

Intimate relationships are the primary focus 
of hostility and discrimination against 
homosexuals. Society severely restricts 
where homosexuals can meet, prevents 
public displays of affection between them, 
and does not allow legal marriages to be 
formed. Gay and lesbian youth suffer greater 
isolation than homosexual adults and far 
greater social deprivation than other adoles- 
cents. It is extremely difficult for them to 
meet other homosexuals and they frequently 
do not know anyone like themselves. Gay 
youth who hide their identity often form their 
first romantic attachments to unknowing 
friends, teachers, and peers. These are often 
cases of unrequited love with the youth never 
revealing their true feelings. Gay youth are 
fragile in these situations and may experience 
despair or suicidal feelini^ from never being 
able to fulfill their hopes for a relationship. 
Some gay youth bravely reveal their feelings 
and may attempt suicide after blatant rejec- 
tion by a teacher or the loss of a close friend. 

Young gay males often experience their first 
homosexual relationships as brief sexual en- 
counters in clandestine meeting places (e.g., 
parks). The extreme need for secrecy and 
anonymous nature of these contacts ,* pious- 
ly hinder their further development. « ae in- 
tensity of sexual feelings that accompany 
these encounters can easily be mistaken for 
romantic attachment by young gay males. 
They may feel suicidal at the failure of these 
experiences to meet intimacy needs and the 
inability to fulfill the social expectation of 
sustaining the relationship. Young lesbians 
experience greater isolation than young 
males. They are less likely to explore their 
sexuality or have relationships during adoles- 
cence. They may feel suicidal at the despair 
of ever finding love in relationships with 



oVner women. 

Gay and lesbian youth develop intimate 
relationships at a later age than other youth 
and are unable to develop relationship skills 
in the manner of other adolescents. Their 
first romances are an emotionally turbulent 
trial and error process that resembles a 
second adolescence. Gay youth bring to 
these relationships extreme dependency 
needs resulting from the deprivation ex- 
perienced in their relationships with family 
and peers. They also are still in the process 
of forming their identity and have unresolved 
issues of guilt and poor self-esteem. When 
conflicts arise in homosexual relationships 
there are few social supports available to as- 
sist them. This is compounded for gay youth 
by their frequent need for secrecy and the 
fact that they may not be open about their 
identity with family and friends. 

Breaking up with a lover may confirm earlier 
negative experiences and concepts as- 
sociated with being a homosexual. Young 
lesbians often explore and define their 
sexuality within the context of their first 
relationships. A relationship failure for them 
may be synonymous with problems in 
developing a positive lesbian identity. For 
some gay youth, relationships become a way 
of filling needs for love and belonging miss- 
ing from family and peers. When the 
relationship ends, the youth feel as though 
they have lost everything. They fear that they 
will always be alone, that no one cares, and 
nothing is worth living for. 

Independent Living 

Gay and lesbian youth are more likely than 
other adolescents to be forced to leave home 
and become self sufficient prematurely. 
Some of these youth have been hiding their 
identities and can no longer stand the ex- 
treme isolation in their lives. Many others 
have been rejected by families and have 
dropped out of school, effectively forced out 
of their communities because of their sexual 
orientation. Gay youth come to large cities 
hoping to find others like themselves, 
legitimate employment, a lover and a new 



13V> 



3-131 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



"family." They soon become aware of the 
lack of opportunities available to them and 
become enmeshed in the problems of sur- 
vival. Suicidal feelings emerge as the hope 
for a new and better life begins to pale. 

Most gay youth are unprepared for the dif- 
ficulties they encounter. They are dis- 
criminated against in finding employment 
and housing by virtue of being both young 
and homosexual. Many have no vocational 
training and some were not able to finish high 
school. They often find limited support from 
the lesbian and gay male adult conununity 
who fear involvement with youth. Many are 
forced to turn to the streets for survival. A 
recent study on adolescent male prostitution 
found that nearly 75 percent identified them- 
selves as gay or bisexual, with family conflicts 
as the primary reason for leaving home (43). 
Many gay youth become homeless. Others 
depend on relationships with people they 
meet on the streets to obtain shelter and sur- 
vival needs. 

Gay youth living on the streets are at greater 
risk of suicide due to repeated exposure to 
chronic substance abuse, physical and sexual 
assault, and sexually transmitted diseases in- 
cluding AIDS. Their contact with the limited 
segment of gay adults involved in street life 
confirms a negative image of homosexuality 
and they remain unaware of the variety of 
positive adult gay lifestyles open to them. 
Their relationships are tenuous and compli- 
cated by dependence on their lovers for sup- 
port. Some gay and lesbian youth engage in 
increasingly reckless and self-destructive be- 
havior as an expression of the sadness and 
anger they feel because of the unresolved is- 
sues with their families and despair over their 
new life. A suicide attempt may result from 
a negative contact with their family, breaking 
up with a lover, or failure to make it on their 
own. 

AIDS (Acquired Immune 
Deficiency Syndrome) 

Gay and bisexual male youth again belong to 
two groups at high risk of contracting sexual- 
ly transmitted diseases: gay/bisexual males 



Q 3-132 

ERIC 



and adolescents. Although the number of 
confirmed cases of AIDS and ARCs (AIDS 
Related Conditions) among adolescents is 
small, it is believed that cumulative exposure 
to the virus, beginning in adolescence, may 
result in a diagnosis or symptoms as a young 
adult. Gay and bisexual males have always 
been subject to a greater number of health 
problems through sexually transmitted dis- 
eases (STD). They comprise a substantial 
majority of confirmed cases of AIDS and 
more than SO percent of adult gay males will 
contract Hepatitis Type B during their 
lifetime (44). 

Young people are taught in our society that 
sex is a secretive and spontaneous activity. 
Adolescent males are not encouraged to take 
responsibility for their sexual behavior; the 
vast majority do not take precautions in their 
sex practices. They engage in impulsive and 
unplanned sexual activity with grave conse- 
quences. Young people contract several mil- 
lion cases of STDs every year (45). Gay and 
bisexual male youth are particularly vul- 
nerable because of their need for secrecy in 
sexual contacts and the frequency with which 
they engage in unplanned sexual activity. 
Those gay and bisexual male youth living on 
the streets face a substantially greater risk of 
exposure to STDs because of repeated sexual 
contacts in their relationships and prostitu- 
tion experiences. Street youth face addition- 
al exposure through intravenous drug use. 

Sexual experiences are important to gay male 
youth as a way of exploring and affirming 
their sexual orientation. Many do not take 
precautions and share a feeling of invul- 
nerability to future consequences that is 
common among all youth. Remafedi found, 
however, that 45 percent of young gay males 
interviewed had a history of STD's (5). The 
attitudes of young gay males towards ex- 
posure to AIDS ranges from denial to ex 
treme fear to not caring. One young male 
said he was not concerned because 
"teenagers do not get AIDS." Another was 
convinced that a head cold he had developed 
was the first sympvom of AIDS. Those who 
are at greatest risk may be those who simply 



137 



do not care whether they are exposed to the 
virus. Some gay youth have an uncaring ap- 
proach to life that reflects a "suicidal script." 
They are more prone to self-destructive be- 
havior because of the severity of the 
problems they have experienced throughout 
their lives and specifically in relation to their 
sexual orientation. Contracting AIDS be- 
comes for them the fulfillment of a life of pain 
and suffering they no longer want to cope 
with. They feel that they deserve to die. 

Future Outlook 

A final risk factor for gay and lesbian youth 
suicide is a bleak outlook for the future. 
Young people have difficulty seeing a future 
life that is different from the present. Gay 
and lesbian youth fear their lives will always 
be as unhappy and hard as they presently are. 
They do not know that they will receive any 
more caring, acceptance, and support than 
they are getting now. The little information 
they have about homosexuality usually rein- 
forces these mistaken beliefs. Gay youth do 
not understand what life could be like as a gay 
male or lesbian adult. They do not have ac- 
curate informaiion about homosexuality, 
positive role models to pattern themselves 
after, or knowledge of gay and lesbian adult 
lifestyles and communities. Lesbian and gay 
youth frequently don't know that many les- 
bian and gay male adults lead stable, happy, 
and productive lives. They go through 
adolescence feeling lonely, afraid, and hope- 
less. Sometimes they take their own lives. 

ENDING GAY AND LESBIAN 
YOUTH SUICIDE 

We can substantially reduce the risk of 
suicide among gay and lesbian youth. The 
problem is clearly one of providing informa- 
tion, acceptance, and support to gay youth 
for coping with the pressures and conflicts 
they face growing up as homosexuals In our 
society. However, in addressing their con- 
cerns we confront two issues of greater mag- 
nitude: 1) the discrimination against and 
maltreatment of homosexuals by our society 
and 2) the inability of our society to recog- 



nize or accept the existence of homosexuality 
in the young. The homophobia experienced 
by gay youth in all parts of their lives is the 
primary reason for their suicidal feelings and 
behavior. Rofes notes that it is no longer dif- 
ficult to document the violence, shame, and 
hatred by society with which lesbians and gay 
men have lived (13). This is the issue we must 
address to save the lives of gay males and les- 
bians who are young. 

Society 

The first step in ending gay youth suicide is 
to end the discrimination against and stig- 
matization of homosexuals in our society. 
We have tenaciously clung to lies and 
prejuJices about homosexuals for far too 
long. Too many lives have been brutalized 
and lost. A growing body of research con- 
tradicts our negative biases and assumptions 
about gay males and lesbians. We do not, as 
a society, want to continue to hold the un- 
tenable position of senselessly hurting 
others-especially the young. Gay males and 
lesbians need to be accepted as equal 
partners in our society. Laws should 
safeguard their individual rights and not per- 
mit discrimination against them in housing, 
employment, and other areas. Laws 
prohibiting homosexual relationships be- 
tween consenting adults should be repealed 
and marriages between homosexuals should 
be recognized. Special attention should be 
paid to the enforcement of laws that punish 
thee who commit violence against 
homosexuals. Laws can help to establish the 
principle of equality for lesbians and gay men 
and define the conduct of others in their in- 
teractions with them. 

It is an even more comprehensive task to ad- 
dress the negative attitudes about 
homosexuality held by so many people. A 
conscious effort must be made to dispel the 
destructive myths about homosexuality at all 
levels of society. We must promote a posi- 
tive image of gay males and lesbians to reduce 
oppression against them and provide gay 
youth with role models to pattern themselves 
after. Massive education efforts need to take 



133

Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



place that would provide people with ac- 
curate information about homosexuality. 
These efforts especially need to be directed 
to those who have responsibility for the care 
of the young including families, clergy, 
teachers, and helping professionals. The 
media needs to take responsibility for 
promoting a positive image of homosexuals 
that presents a variety of gay male and lesbian 
lifestyles. We must also take personal 
responsibility for revising our own 
homophobic attitudes and behavior as an ex- 
ample to others in the same way that we have 
worked towards revising discriminatory ra- 
cial attitudes and conduct. It is at the per- 
sonal level that we hr ve the greatest impact 
on the lives of those around us. 

Third, we must directly address the issue of 
homosexuality in the young. Our society has 
historically denied the sexuality of young 
people. We must educate ourselves on the 
issues and problems related to sexual 
development in young p«nnle. Society need:* 
to promote a positive image about sexuality 
ana provide youth w»th accurate information 
on the subject. We need to recognize that 
youth are sexually active from an early age 
and that sexual orientation is frequently 
formed by adolescence. All youth need to be 
provided with positive information about 
homosexuality that presents it as a viable 
adaptation. We must accept a homosexual 
orientation in young people in the same man- 
ner we accept a heterosexual orientation. 
Finally, we need to assist gay and lesbian 
young people in the coming our process and 
support them in the many conflicts they 
presently face. 

Family 

Gay and lesbian youth need to receive accep- 
tance and understanding from their families 
if we are to reduce their risk of suicide. 
Parents need to be educated as to the nature 
and development of homosexuality in in- 
dividuals. They often feel guilty and 
ashamed upon first learning that their child 
is gay because they have been told that it is 
wrong and they are to blame. Parents should 




3-134 



know that homosexuality is a natural and 
healthy form of sexual expression; They do 
not need to feel bad about something that is 
good. Parents should also know that we still 
do not know the origins of a heterosexual or 
homosexual orientation. Research indicates 
a predisposition towards sexual orientation 
in children that limits the role of family in its 
development. 

Families have a great deal of influence on 
how their children feel about their sexual 
orientation. Parents should be made aware 
of the potential negative impact homophobic 
remarks and behavior have on their child. 
Homophobic conduct can be taken as rejec- 
tion by youth struggling with their sexual 
orientation or encouragement by other 
youth to victimize homosexuals as they grow 
older. Families need to take responsibility 
for presenting homosexuality in a positive 
context to their children. Parents need to ac- 
cept and understand a son or daughter with 
a homosexual orientation. Those parents 
who have difficulty accepting their lesbian 
daughter or gay son should get more infor- 
mation on the subject and not try to "change" 
them. They should let the child know they 
are still loved and cared about as individuals 
regardless of their sexual orientation. 

Ethnic minority families need to understand 
and accept their gay and lesbian children. 
Ethnic minority gay youth depend even more 
strongly on their extended family and culture 
for support because of the additional oppres- 
sion they face as a racial minority within 
society as a whole and the homosexual com- 
munity. Parents need to be educated as to 
the extent and diversity of lesbians and gay 
males within ethnic minority cultures. They 
need to understand that their child means no 
disresr/ccl to the family and cannot be any dif- 
ferent from whom they are. 

Society needs to reinforce parental respon- 
sibilities for the care of their children, ir- 
respective of sexual orientation, until they 
become adults. Parents need to be held ac- 
countable for the abuse of their children re- 
lated to their homosexual orientation. We 
need to become more conscious of the extent 



P.Gibson: Gay Male and Lesbian Youth Suicide 



to which the abuse of gay adolescents occurs 
within their own families. 

Religion 

Religions need to reassess homosexuality in 
a positive context within their belief systems. 
They need to accept gay youth and make a 
place for them in the church and include 
them ir the same activities as other youth* 
Religions should also take responsibility for 
providing their families and membership with 
positive information about homosexuality 
that discourages the oppression of lesbians 
and gay men. Faiths that condemn 
homosexuality should recognize how they 
contribute to the rejection of gay youth by 
their families and suicide among lesbian and 
gay male youth. 

Schools 

Public and private schools need to take 
responsibility for providing all students at the 
junior high and high school level with posi- 
tive information about homosexuality. Cur- 
riculum materials should include information 
relevant to gay males and lesbians as it per- 
tains to human sexuality, health, literature 
and social studies. Family life classes should 
present homosexuality as a natural and heal- 
thy form of sexual expression. Information 
on critical health issues such as AIDS should 
be presented to all students. Curricula 
should include values clarification around so- 
cial roles to increase the respect for in- 
dividual differences and reduce the s igma 
attached to gender nonconformity. A variety 
of gay male and lesbian adult lifestyles should 
be presented as positive and viable for youth. 
All youth should learn about prominent les- 
bians and gay males throughout history. So- 
cial studies courses should include issues 
relevant to gay male and lesbian concerns 
and provide youth with positive gay and les* 
bian advlt role models in our society. 

Schools need to take responsibility for 
protecting gay and lesbian youth from abuse 
by peers and providing them with a safe en- 
vironment to receive an education. School 
staff need to receive training on how to work 



with gay youth and handle conflicts involving 
gay youth. Teachers should feel secure in 
being able to rebut homophobic remarks and 
defend gayyouth against harassment. Strong 
disciplinary actions should be imposed on 
those who victimize gay and lesbian youth. It 
is important for schools to hire openly gay 
male and lesbian teachers to serve as role 
models and resource people for gay youth. 
Counseling services that are sensitive to the 
needs and concerns of gay youth should be 
available to them. Special educational 
programs may need to be developed for those 
youth who cannot be incorporated into exist- 
ing school settings to ensure that young gay 
males and lesbians receive an equal educa- 
tion. 

Social Support 

Gay and lesbian youth need access to the 
same social supports and recreational ac- 
tivities that other youth have. This would 
reduce their isolation and enhance their posi- 
tive social development. Communities need 
to develop social groups and activities (i.e., 
dances) specifically for gay and lesbian youth 
as a way of meeting others like themselves 
and developing relationship skills. Existing 
youth programs such as the Boy and Girl 
Scouts should incorporate gay youth into 
their activities. Youth programs such as Big 
Brothers and Sisters should enlist gay and les- 
bian adults to work with gay youth. It is very 
important for gay youth to see the potential 
of a happy and stable lifestyle as adults. Les- 
bians and gay men need to become more in- 
volved in supporting gay youth and being 
positive role models for them. This requires 
assurance for gay adults that they will not be 
harassed and accused of '^recruiting'* youth in 
doing so. 

Professional Help 

Lesbian and gay youth must have access to 
social services and professional counseling 
that is sensitive to their needs and able to ad- 
dress their concerns. This is critical to reduc- 
ing their risk of suicide. Sexuality is one of 
the most important issues facing all young 



MO 



3-135 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



people. We need to be open about sexuality 
and accepting of homosexuality in young 
people. All social service agencies and men- 
tal health professionals working with youth 
need specialized training on homosexuality 
and issues relevant to gay and lesbian youth. 
We also need to address issues of suicide and 
depression in young people. Suicidality 
needs to be explored with youth who have a 
gay, lesbian, bisexual or transsexual identity. 
Problems related to a homosexual orienta- 
tion should be assessed as a possible reason 
for suicidal feelings. The goal of treatment 
should be to assist lesbian and gay youth in 
developing a positive identity and to support 
their sexual orientation in the conflicts they 
face with others. Additional counseling 
guidelines are provided in Appendix B. 

Youth agencies need to provide outreach to 
gay and lesbian youth to make them aware of 
services and assure them that they are wel- 
come. Gay youth are often afraid to seek 
he!p because of potential negative reactions 
from others. Programs should hire gay staff 
that reflect the population of gay youth 
under their care. Helping professionals 
should be prepared to offer referrals to gay- 
identified services and therapists if requested 
by the youth. It is an accepted premise in so- 
cial services that individuals have access to 
programs and staff that reflect their cultural 
background. This principle is no less true for 
gay young people who often would prefer to 
talk about their problems with a lesbian or 
gay man. 

Specialized services should be developed for 
gay and lesbian youth that reflect their par- 
ticular needs. Health care programs aimed 
at preventing AIDS and other sexually-trans- 
mitted diseases need to be directed towards 
young gay males. Alcohol and substance 
abuse programs need to target gay and les- 
bian youth as a population at risk. Pregnan- 
cy-related services should not assume a 
heterosexual orientation in young women 
and be prepared to discuss lesbian concerns. 
Vocational training and independent living 
skills programs may need to address special 
problems gay youth face in becoming self suf-

ficient and in being incorporated into an 
adult gay community. 

Residential Programs 

The juvenile justice system needs to take 
responsibility for ensuring that gay and les- 
bian youth receive fair treatment by the 
juvenile court and are placed in safe, nurtur- 
ing) and supportive environments. Special- 
ized training in working with and 
understanding gay youth should be provided 
to foster parents, group home personnel, 
treatment center staff, and juvenile hall 
counselors. Gay youth should be incor- 
porated into placements, whenever possible, 
where the staff has been taught how to sup- 
port gays in issues with other residents. It is 
critical for the juvenile court to show leader- 
ship in preventing discrimination against gay 
youth by prohibiting placements that refuse 
to accept them or that provide them with in- 
ferior care. The needs of some gay and les- 
bian youth might best be served in the 
immediate future by placement in a gay iden- 
tified foster or group homes. Extremely few 
such placements presently exist. The 
juvenile court should facilitate the licensing 
of gay male and lesbian foster parents along 
with the development of residential 
programs specifically for those gay youth who 
cannot be incorporated into existing place- 
ments. 

Research 

The lack of information about gay and les- 
bian youth suicide is a reflection of the op- 
pression of homosexuals by our society and 
the invisibility of large numbers of gay males 
and lesbians within the youth population. 
There is growing awareness that a serious 
problem exists but we have only started to 
break down the wall of silence surrounding 
the issue. Comprehensive research is 
needed to determine the extent and nature 
of suicide among young gay males, lesbians, 
bisexuals, and transsexuals. These studies 
need to ensure that the entire spectrum of 
gay youth is adequately represented includ- 
ing lesbians, homeless youth, and ethnic 



Ml

minorities. This research can be the founda- 
tion for greater recognition of the problem 
and the allocation of resources designed to 
address it. Hopefully, the work done in 
recent years will serve as the beginning of the 
end of suicide among gay and lesbian youth.

APPENDIX B 

COUNSEUNGGAYAND 
LESBIAN YOUTH 

These of us who work with jOVtig people 
need to be able to identify gav and lesbian 
youth, accept them for whom they are and 
support them in resolving their problems. 
Many of these problems are directly related 
to their sexual orientation. If we can't iden- 
tity these youth, we probably won't be able to 
help them. The first step is being able to talk 
about sexuality concerns with any youth 
under your care. 

Sexuality Counseling 

Don't be afraid to talk with youth about 
sexuality issues. You do not incur any 
liability for doing so. Initial interviews should 
include questions about the youth's sexuality 
just as they include other issues that affect 
their life (i.e., family, school, substance use, 
suicide, and depression). It is appropriate to 
do further sexuality counseling with a young 
person if you have a good relationship with 
him/her and necessary if you feel that 
sexuality conflicts are an important part of 
the situation. It is good to examine your own 
attitudes and minimize prejudices so that 
youth can feel free to convey their feelings 
and experiences to you. The principle of 
nonjudgmental therapeutic intervention is 
especially important in working with gay and 
lesbian youth. Feel comfortable with your 
own sexuality in order to keep tensions be- 
tween you and your client to a minimum. 

Sexual Orientation 

Don't be afraid to ask youth directly about 
their sexual orientation. Sexual orientation 
should be routinely included in questions and 
discussions related to sexuality concerns. 
Some youth will volunteer the information 
that they have a gay or lesbian orientation. V 
you strongly feel that a youth is gay, the only 
way to Hnd out may be simply to ask. This 
does not reflect negatively on you, and your 
intuition is often correct. Even if you are 



wrong, it rarely hurts your rapport with the 
youth if approached in a Sr nsitive way. If you 
are unable to broach the subject with them, 
it is most likely a reflection of your own dis- 
comfort with the issue. Remember that one 
of the greatest risk factors in the problem gay 
youth face is the wall of «ilence surrounding 
the subject, ihe silence needs to be broken 
if you are to enter the lonely place where 
many gay and lesbian youth reside. It may be 
good to let youth know in some way that you 
accept young people regardless of their 
sexual orientation before asking them. Be 
prepared to give youth accurate and positive 
information about homosexuality. Assure 
them it is a healthy and positive ibrm of 
human expression. Gay youth will be listen- 
ing closely. 

Acceptance 

Accept the youth's sexiial orientation as they 
report it to you. Their sexual identity should 
be based on the self reporting of their feel- 
ings and experiences. Do not label a youth 
as heterosexual or homosexual based on your 
own assumptions. Assure gay youth it is not 
sick, bad or wrong for them to be the way they 
are and that you are not going to try and 
change them. Let them know you care about 
them just as much after the disclosure as 
before. They are used to being rejected by 
others who find out they are gay. Respect 
them for being open and honest with you. It 
was probably hard for them to do and shows 
that they trust you. 

Sexual Orientation Confusion 

Do not assume a youth is confused about 
their sexual orientation if they identify as gay 
or bisexual. Many people both gay and 
straight have trouble accepting that an in- 
dividual is bisexual. It is important to validate 
bisexuality as a viable option for youth. 
However, some youth are genuinely con- 
fused about their sexual orientation. It is im- 
portant for them to know that it is alright to 
be confused. They should not feel pressured 



3-140 



145 



F'.Qli:)son: Gay Male and Lesbian Youth Suicide 



to label themselves one way or another. A 
useful method in helping them to clarify a 
confused or undecided orientation is the 
Kinsey Percentage Scale. This technique al- 
lows the youtli to be any combination of 
homosexual and heterosexual feelint;s and 
experiences that adds up to 100 petcent. 
They can be 85 percent straight and 15 per- 
cent gay. Or they can be 40 percent straight 
and 60 percent gay. It is .mportant to let 
them know you will accept them no matter 
where they fall on this scale. The purpose of 
this method is to give youth a context that al- 
lows them to identify their orientation along 
a continuum. It is easy to move from here to 
discussing specific feelings and experiences 
with them. 

Gender Identity 

Assure effeminate young gay males and mas- 
culine young lesbians that it is alright for 
them to be that way. Gender noi2<x)nformity 
is common among gay youth and may be a 
way for them to affirm their identity. Some 
gay yoi?th, however, become confused by cul- 
tural stereotypes that insist gay men be like 
women and lesbians be like men. They feel 
they actually have to be a person of the op- 
posite gender in order to be gay. Be 
prepared to talk with them about their per- 
ceptions of what it is like being a young gay 
male or lesbian. Help them to separate so- 
cial adaptation issues from whether they real- 
ly believe th^ are a person of the opposite 
sex. Assure them they do not have to be any 
particular way in order to be gay. 
Transsexual youth will express a persistent 
desire to be a person of the opposite sex and 
live as that person over time. They will 
engage in frequent cross dressing and adapt 
the name of a person of the opposite sex. It 
is important for you to accept these youth for 
who they believe they are and call them by 
the name they want to be called. This is criti- 
cal to establishing basic rapport with these 
youth and effectively addressing their con- 
cerns. 



Self Esteem 

Gay and lesbian youth frequently suffer from 
low self esteem. They have often received a 
disproportionate amount of negative atten- 
tion because of their f- sniality. Being gay has 
been the focus of problems and stigmatiza- 
tion for them. Assure them there is nothing 
wrong with being gay and that it is the 
response of others tc liomc^exuals that is thp 
source of the problem. Help them to develop 
pride in who they are and a positive identity 
as a gay male or lesbian. Sometimes they 
have had too much of their identity focused 
on their sexuality. It is easy for them to u:me 
to see themselves as sexual beings after be- 
coming known as homosexuals. Assure them 
that sexuality is only part of who they are. Ex- 
plore other areas of potential growth that 
give them a broader understanding of them- 
selves as individuals. Know the potential of 
gay youth under your care and work with 
them in a way that allows them to achieve 
n^ore succes' than failure. Give positive 
feedback whenever possible. Be confident 
and optimistic of their ability to improve their 
situation and lead stable and happy lives as 
gay male and lesbian adults. 

Family 

Gay and lesbian youth sometimes mistake 
their parents inability to accept their sexual 
orientation as a rejection of them as in- 
dividuals. Freo/jently, parents still love their 
child but need time to come to understand 
and accept them as gay. Gay youth have 
trouble recognizing that an initial negative 
reaction by parents may change in the future. 
Help families to clarify their feelings for each 
other and encourage gay youth to be patient 
in gaining acceptance. Those gay and lesbian 
youth who have not come out to their parents 
should not be pressured to do so. It is a per- 
sonal decision that they should make careful- 
ly. Finally, assure gay and lesbian youth that 
they too will have families as adults. Wbile 
not the traditional family, their families will 
be comprised of those friends, lovers, and 
relatives who remain close with them over a 
long period of time. Their relationships can

be as rich and rewarding as those of other 
people* Being a gay male or lesbian does not 
mean that you are going to be alone.

ISSUES FOR SURVIVORS 



Curtis Mitchell Delane, Florida 



SUMMARY 

The harvest of dead youth is only a small part 
of the total damage caused by the current 
crisis in teenage suicide. For each teenager 
who dies, a phalanx of survivors is suddenly 
burdened by devastating reactions. Their 
lifestyles are altered, their futures scuttled, 
their minds and bodies attacked by infir- 
mities. Many of them are so shaken that they 
require professional help. 

Unfortunately, the plight of survivors has 
been almost totally unrecognized. Only a 
few observers have studied their needs and 
formulated suggestions for their rehabilita- 
tion. Their books on the subject offer useful 
insights and protocols for regaining a 
semblance of normalcy. Successful therapy 
depends largely on what happens during 
what is now called the grief recovery process. 

A survivor himself, the author of this paper 
describes the steps taken by his family. Each 
step on the route to peace of mind, he warns, 
can also involve an emotional booby-trap 
that can defeat the entire process of libera- 
tion; it can also doom a griever to perpetual 
sorrow. Phases presenting unique difficul- 
ties include shock, denial, bargaining, anger, 
and guilt. Special danger exists, the author 
says, in the average survivor's confrontation 
with stigma. Regrettably, he relates, the dis- 
covery that the rights of female grievers are 
frequently denied under the guise of chival- 
rous "protection." This well-meant denial 
can sometimes leave a life-long trauma. It 
must be corrected, and it can be corrected 
when women survivors, despite their grief. 



assert their rights and challenge their mas- 
culine care-givers. 

Under some circumstances, survivors require 
special help. Sources to be explored are 
named. So are procedures for self-help that 
may dissolve persistent grief fragments. 
Fir ally, aspects of community behavior are 
challenged. If these suggestions were fol 
lowed, thousands of grievers who have been 
incapacitated might regain their lapsed roles 
as worthwhile and useful human beings. 

INTRODUCTION 

A strange new blight afflicts our earth. Its 
distemper infects thousands, perhaps mil- 
lions of our citizens. Neither virus nor 
isotope distributes its mischief. Its 
pathogens are man-made and are trans- 
mitted by bullets and drugs and broken 
hearts. 

Two examples. 

Ken and Mary Whitman were happy 
Floridians using their combined salaries to 
put their three sons through college. Jock, 
the oldest, came home during spring break. 
One night, the Whitmans returned to their 
home following a late meeting and found his 
body swinging from a backyard tree. 

Mary charged Ken, the father, with applying 
too much harsh discipline. He charged her 
with coddling the boy and countermanding 
his own orders. The two surviving sons took 
sides, one for each parent. The Whitmans

separated and fought bitterly over their 
divorce. Within months, that family had dis- 
solved. 

On the Pacific coast, Joan and Tom Miller ar- 
ranged for their son and daughter to help 
celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary. 
On the afternoon of the party, daughter Bar- 
bara arrived home late from her job. Passing 
the garage, she smelled gasoline fumes. Her 
mother's lifeless body was sprawled over the 
steering wheel of her car. No suicide note 
could be found, nor any reason for the act. 
Family members became unhinged. Tom's 
social drinking exploded into alcoholism. 
Barbara became convinced she could have 
saved her mother's life if she had come home 
on time. Son Jim, 12, felt shut out and 
rejected. Acting out his rage, he stole a bike, 
destroyed school property, and was expelled. 
The State sent him to a foster home. Barbara 
attempted suicide, botched it, and was con- 
signed to a treatment center. The father 
refused help for his alcoholism and was fired. 
The doomed family lasted less than a year. 

Few observers will deny that an ancient and 
intractable malady seems to possess our 
spirits. Its infection spares neither nations 
nor continents. Its victims are a mob too 
large to count or comprehend. Their ail- 
ments fill a pharmacopoeia. Their depres- 
sion spins off a spray of shattered families, 
bankrupted careers, and poisoned dreams. 

The germ that spreads the plague is called 
suicide. The men, women, and children left 
behind are called survivors, and they are in 
trouble. 

So what else is new? 

Well, it's new that we are finally aware that 
our young people are committing suicide at 
an unprecedented rate. And that eveiy one 
of those deaths sends up a mushroom cloud 
that drops a fallout of pain, guilt, and depres- 
sion on the uncountable survivors left be- 
hind. 

Daily, the media trumpet a warning. Famous 
lecturer-on-love, Leo Buscaglia, says "In the 
United States 14 people between the ages nf 




3-144 



15 and 24 kill themselves every day." That's 
about 5,000 per year. The suicide rate for 
this age group has tripled over only three 
decades. Worse, for every death reported, 
there are an estimated 50 to 100 attempts. 

Dr. Art Ulene, the TV pundit, says, "Nearly 
60 Americans take their lives every day and 
ten times that number attempt suicide." 

Paul Harvey, commentator and columnist, 
says that 13 school children are murdering 
themselves daily. 

Newspaper stories confirm their tallies. In 
Woods County, Wisconsin, five young 
people shot themselves to death last winter. 
Ten others in the same community made the 
attempt and failed. In the suburbs north of 
New York City, 17 suicides were recorded in 
a brief time span. Clusters of death have 
erupted among teenagers in and near Piano, 
Texas, on Chicago's North Shore, in Lincoln, 
Nebraska, and in California. Neither sex is 
spared. More girls than boys attempt by a 
ratio of four to one. More boys than girls suc- 
ceed by a ratio of about four to one. 

One asks: are such figures accurate? The 
answer is no. No person on earth knows how 
many suicides take place in America. The 
figures are collected using an archaic system 
that is corrupted by indifference and 
cronyism. Assigned officials include not only 
coroners, physicians, and medical examiners, 
but in some places, deputy sheriffs, mor- 
ticians, and justices of the peace. Under- 
reporting is assured in many districts by the 
refusal of back-patting appointees to pin the 
stigma of suicide-in-the-family on a friend, a 
leading citizen, or an elected politician. 

The result is a shambles that has been called 
"the great cover up." Covered up also is the 
fact that our country has become the killing 
ground not only for any army of young people 
who are sick of life, but also of a much greater 
mass of survivors whose roll call mounts an- 
nually into the hundreds of thousands, per- 
haps into the milJons. 

Who are they? We can tick them off on our 
fingers beginning at the family core and

counting the husbands, wives, parents, 
children, brothers, sisters, grandparents, un- 
cles and aunts. Not, count their pastors, 
coaches, doctors, counselors, teachers, 
employers. Last, there are schoolmates, 
clubmates, and even filling stations atten- 
dants. 

What do those survivors want from life? 
Researchers have studied them and named 
their stations of the cross. Their journey is 
called the grief process. Its elements include 
shock, denial, bargaining, stigma, contamina- 
tion, isolation, fear of insanity, guilt, anger, 
rejection, ostracism, acceptance, and finally, 
deliverance. 

Their problem is that they don't know what 
hit them. Nor has their life experience 
equipped them to cope well enough to 
stablilize their lives. In many ways, social 
workers report, they act and think like young 
babies. 

In our culture, society assumes a respon- 
sibility for babies. But where does one start? 
Our courts of law and the practice of jour- 
nalism offers one formula. Why not examine 
some witnesses? 

An investigator to whom all professionals are 
indebted is Edwin Shneidman, formerly co- 
founder and co-director of the Los Angeles 
Suicide Prevention Center, now located at 
the University of California. In one of his 
books. Voices of Death, he suggested four in- 
itiatives that can help grief-stricken sur- 
vivors. 

First, refuse to accept the stigma of 
suicide. 

Second, rid yourself of the notion that 
you, the survivor, might suffer a similar 
fate. 

Third, free your daytime thoughts and 
your night-time dreams of images of 
blood and violence. 

Fourih, restrain any obsession to learn 
the whys, the whats, and the if onlys. 

To assist the recovery process, Shneidman 
published an essay entitled "Care of the 



Bereaved" Here is his advice, paraphrased. 

A counselor should begin to work with a 
survivor-victim as soon as possible. 

Be aware that your survivor client will 
probably welcome a chance to talk with 
a pro. 

Expect to encounter powerful negative 
emotions such as irritation, anger, envy, 
shame, guilt, and the like. All of them 
must be ventilated. 

Obtain a medical examination by a 
physician. It will give you a baseline for 
checking developments. 

Reject the temptation to act as a voice of 
conscience and offer instead, the soft 
voice of reason. 

Avoid all banalities. 

Expect a slow recovery punctuated by 
setbacks. Expect working through the 
process to take a long time. Healing is 
rarely achieved in less than a year. It may 
extend to the grave. 

Insist on a program of health care includ- 
ing suicide prevention, intervention if 
needed, and postvention as a safeguard. 

Since Shneidman's first publication, the 
world has adopted many of his recommenda- 
tions and the lot of survivors has improved. 
Hundreds of volumes now offer programs to 
prevent suicide. Only a handful are con- 
cerned about survivors. The latter are all 
worth reading, particularly a small volume 
titled Suicide by Jacques Charon, the 
American philosopher. His historical chap- 
ters provide valuable background, and his 
abstracts of what some of the world's greatest 
minds have thought of suicide are inspiring. 

Or pick up Suicide and Grief by Howard W. 
Stone, a professional counselor. When he 
discusses pastoral care, his words are golden. 
His battle plan says: 

Keep active. 

Join group activities such as club, church, 
or charity.

Work hard at creating new friends.

still festers. 

Rediscover hope. 

Rnd a meaning for your life. 

Living When a Loved One Has Died by Eari 
Grollman has earned its right to be called a 
classic. 

The Ultimate Loss by Joan Bordow reports 
the death of a child. A survivor herself, she 
calls it the most devastating of all deaths, and 
"an affront to our attempt at immortality as 
well as our sense of fair play." 

The Morning After Death by L.D. "Johnson 
telb of a dau^ter's death by accident on an 
icy hi^way. Dr. Johnson, professor of reli^n 
atFurman University, has given us the story of 
a man's triumphant pilgrimage through 
tragedy. Don't miss the chapter called "The 
Nature and Uses of Death.* 

I liked what I found in Suicide Assessment 
and Intervention, a book of essays. Its fifth 
chapter by Barbara Bell Foglia directs atten- 
tion to bereaved children. They have never 
known death and cannot understand it, she 
says. So when it happens, include them in 
family conferences. Exclusion makes them 
feel unworthy. Above all, do not lie. Daddy 
has not gone on a long, long journey. 
Mommy has not been called to be with God. 
Dead is dead is dead. 

A motif that emerges from all these writings 
is a clear understanding of a survivor's suffer- 
ing. Iris Bolton writes of its many faces in her 
book, My Son..hfy Son., when she quotes 
her clients as insisting: 

"I am going crazy." 

"I cannot live without my man." 

"Nobody feels my anguish like I do, so 
how can anyone else understand my 
despair?" 

"A doctor told me that suicide can be in- 
herited and it frightens me that another 
person in my family may choose to die.

even me." 

"People think we're a bad family, that I'm 
a bad mother. How can I face anyone 
again?" 

"I can't stop reliving the moment I found 
the body and seeing the blood." 

"If I let go, I'll explode." 

But the record shows that unbearable pain 
can become bearable and that hopelessness 
can be converted into hope. I've seen it hap- 
pen. 

I saw it happen when Curtis Mitchell Bolton, 
age 20, my grandson, and the son of Iris and 
Jack Bolton, shot and killed himself. It takes 
only a split second to create a survivor, a fami- 
ly of survivors, or a town full of survivors. I 
shall not recite the bad aftermath. I shall 
name some of the good things because they 
became the solid rock on which we built 
recovery. 

The first good thing was advice offered to the 
Boltons by a friend of the family who was also 
a psychiatrist. As Iris describes it, "That first 
visit, he took my husband and me and our 
three sons into a private room. His gaze lock- 
ed my eyes to his. 'You will survive,' he 
declared firm!^. "You will survive, if you 
choose to do so.*" 

Next he advised that all important decisions 
be made by the whole family. Huddling 
together, conferring together during those 
first days, they discovered comfort in consen- 
sus. 

His third injunction was to look for some 
good to emerge from the horror of the mo- 
ment. "Seek it," he urged. I thought, "What 
an absurdity." Nevertheless, '^e began to 
search. 

Permit me to pause long enough to indulge 
in a personal reminiscence. When my 
grandson shot himself and when I first be- 
came the kind of strangulated survivor who 
usually emerges from this kind of experience, 
I endured a quality of pain previously un- 
known to me. It spread through the family, 
sparing no one. Because ofit, I became a stu- 



151 



C.Mitchell: Issues for Survivors 



dent of pain and of the unique agony that is 
so often the result of a suicide. What I am 
reporting now extends far beyond my own ex- 
perience. Indeed, I am indebted to many sur- 
vivors and owe special thanks to the members 
of support groups and to the expressions of 
members of the caring organization called 
Compassionate Friends. 

I must add this caveat. I can disclose no magic 
formula to anesthetize human suffering. No 
rule of thumb applies. The grief process is 
said to be a series of steps. These steps do 
not march in single file. Often, they behave 
like unruly children on a school bus. They 
change places. They roar and they whisper. 
In the midst of their grief, some survivors be- 
come so confused they literally cannot recall 
their ABCs. My own experience was a sort 
of free-fall into a bottomless black hole. 

My concern for survivors is that some do not 
plunge as I did. Instead, they soar, some of 
them into a booby trap. Think of grief as a 
minefield strewn with explosives. Survivors 
are not ordinarily equipped with mine detec- 
tors. Nor are many consultants. Some of the 
latter say, "Just take your pills. You'll be all 
right." Don't believe it. 

Consider this situation. A family has lived for 
months or years in misery, enslaved by the al- 
coholic tyranny of a father. His suicide sud- 
denly liberates them. They think, "At last, I 
don't have to submit to abuse and humilia- 
tion." But second thoughts occur. Our moral 
code asserts that nobody should feel good be- 
cause of another's death. So guilt takes over. 
Without help, it may last for years, through 
additional decades of enslavement. 

Griefs second step is usually called denial. 
Defending itself from shock, the human 
psyche rejects reality and tries to find a refuge 
in fantasy. The experience is like being 
tossed about in a cement mixer. Our orderly 
world is overturned. So are our most valued 
precepts. We have believed that a religious 
faith and a loving heart guaranteed a good 
lifb. The bitter fact is that life is no longer 
good. A dear one's death has scuttled both 
our faith and future. 



So the ego tries to escape the pain by deny- 
ing the suicide. Circumstances are invented 
to "prove" the accident. Newspaper stories 
which repeat one's fancies authenticate their 
veracity. This is another booby trap. Deep 
down, one knows that the story is a lie and 
that pretenUi I :g otherwise involves a lifetime 
of lying. What such a survivor does not know 
is that keeping a secret~any secret-absorbs 
a prodigious amount of energy. Lack of 
energy depletes the body and mind for as long 
as one lives. Presently, fear invades one's tis- 
sues, fear that the lie will be discovered. 
Close behind walks the monster called guilt. 
Ultimately, comes death. 

Next, make way for anger. Let's face it. 
Anger elbows its way into grief in the majority 
of suicides. The deed is so surreptitious and 
so unfair. The brain protests, "Why wasn't I 
told that his staying alive had become un- 
bearable? Now I'll never know." 

Or "Surely I could have been given an hour 
to argue against his decision to die." 

Or "It's so unfair that I'm faced with a future 
alone, and without even a chance to plan." 

Yes, anger floods the mind, washing over all 
those near and dear. Nor does God escape. 
Which leads to another kind of ambush. 
Many survivors begin to play the game of 
"Who's to blame?" When an accident hap- 
pens, we Americans are the world's fastest 
finger-pointers. "Who Done It" is a literary 
game. After a suicide, the question can be- 
come an obsession. A survivor usually learns 
the hard way that placing blame rarely solves 
a problem. To help overcome this hazard, a 
counselor requires steady thinking and affec- 
tionate guidance. In today's world, both 
qualities are in short supply. 

Guilt provides another ambush. And guilt is 
almost inevitable. It comes bubbling out of 
one's collection of If Onlys: if only I had been 
a better friend or parent, if only I had spent 
more time at home, if only I had known what 
I now know about depression. 1 eeming with 
a host of such questions, in some of us, the 
mind turns to What Ifs.

Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



What if I had shown how much love I could 
give? What if I had backed off instead of 
forcing a showdown? What if I had flushed 
those extra pills down the John, or buried that 
pistol, or burned that rope. 

William A. Miller wrote a useful book a few 
years ago called When Going topees Holds 
You Together. He tells of a married couple 
who saved their mon^ all their lives for a 
round-the-world trip. At age 65, he retires 
and they buy their tickets. They go to the air- 
port and check in. Their plane is announced, 
he suffers a heart attack, and dies. 

Miller tells us that the wife lapsed at once 
into the If Only ritual, mumbling over and 
over: 

"If only we'd never thought of this trip." 

"If only I'd got him to the hospital 
sooner." 

Another case. A father had twin sons of 
whom he was very proud. During a walk in 
the woods, the boys strayed into a pond and 
were drowned, llie father sobbed, "If only 
I'd taught them to swim." He turned to al- 
cohol for 12 miserable years, repeating daily 
his self-accusation. Finally, he killed himself. 

Guilt spreads like a cancer, destroying self- 
esteem and sapping one's energy. Thus 
weakened, many minds think, "If suicide was 
the only way out for my loved one, then it was 
because I failed him. So I'm responsible for 
his death and I must be a terrible person." 
The thought persists, nourished by apathy, 
and another survivor is ambushed. 

But there's more. Psychologists tell me that 
guilt often turns to shame, and that shame is 
a consequence oi a perceived failure. Failure 
demeans the ego. The ego, Hghting back 
however it can, sometimes suppresses the 
idea of failure and stores it in the mind's back 
alleys where it decays and stinks for a 
lifetime. 

Some of us turn belligerent and aggressive. 
Some of us seek revenge. 
Some of us hit the bottle. 



Not a pretty picture, is it? Nor is it what the 
person who committed suicide wanted. His 
quest in most cases was simply for peace or 
surcease of pain. 

What I am saying is that each step of the grief 
process usujdly presents a potential pitfall. 
Survivors are dumped without warning into 
an emotional jungle. At Hrst, they are like 
marionettes, reacting to the pull of forces 
they do not understand. They respond from 
the gut, as you counselors know. Those 
responses are really feelings. Let me repeat 
what some survivors said: 

"I feel utterly lost without the presence 
of the person who has left me." 

"I need the presence of someone to 
whom I can give my love." 

"My memory is missing. I've lost my 
brain." 

"I'm obsessed with that moment when I 
discovered the suicide and I ^ live it daily 
through all my five senses ' 

"Driving my car, I must think carefully 
through each movement of my foot or 
hand. If I don't, I may forget to apply the 
brake or to turn the steering wheel when 
I drive into my garage." 

"I can't believe that I am alone. Once, I 
saw my wife standing at the foot of my 
bed." 

"When I catch myself laughing at a 
friend's joke, I feel guilty." 

"People treat me as if I'm contagious." 

"I just want to cut and run." 

Can anyone doubt that many survivors need 
help?" 

But there's more. In examining the grief 
process, let's look at what is perhaps the 
stickiest wicket of them all. Its name is stig- 
ma. 

Stigma was once defined among the ancients 
as a sear left by a hot iron. I like that! Can 
you think of a hotter iron than suicide? Our 
modern defmition says stigma is a stain or a 



ERIC

CMItchell: Issues for Survivors 



mark of shame. And I'll buy that. For suicide 
surely leaves a stain, a judgment which is ap- 
plauded and endorsed by our society as an 
unalterable moral fact. Society's attitude, I 
believe, is a sorry commentary on what we 
call Christian civilization. 

Trace it back a few thousand years. 
Mankind's primeval fear of evil spirits and 
voodoo gods gave it a start It became a so- 
cial monster about 400 years after the death 
of Christ when Saint Augustine, the Bishop 
of Hippo, proscribed suicide because of 
God's sixth commandment which said, "Thou 
shalt not kill." Thus, suicide became a sin. 

What does its stigma do? 

To put it bluntly, it paints innocent bystand- 
ers with tar and feathers. If killing is sin, then 
killing the self produces a sinner. For cen- 
turies now, the act has smirched, smeared, 
slurred and shamed millions of persons 
whose worst sin was loving another whose al- 
location of misery was too great to bear. 

What does it do? 

The telephone stops ringing. 

Invitations to parties, birthday celebrations, 
Christmas tree burnings, fetes ' 'hich one has 
attended for years, no longer crowd one's 
mailbox. 

Social gatherings that are attended become 
stressful because old friends steer small talk 
away from the mention of death or the name 
of the dear one who has died. 

Walking down the street, you see an old 
friend approaching. Your heart leaps with 
pleasure. The friend sees you and crosses to 
the other side. You know she is pretending. 
It happens. 

This ostracism leads to isolation. One sur- 
vivor reported, "I feel as if I'd been quaran- 
tined." Isolation turns thoughts inward, to 
apathy, to illness. Sometimes, it persuades 
one to build a shrine to one's lost love. Have 
you seen them? Bedrooms where every col- 
lege pennant, every poster is in the exact spot 
where it was tacked a decade eariier. Or a 
dresser top bearing a half-smoked pipe, a golf 



ball, and enough change for bus fare. Or a 
cradle holding a doll. 

Often, the damage runs deeper, even into 
mental decline, a result of the absence of life- 
supporting relationships. 

Quickly, I must catalog a handful of addition- 
al hazards that threaten recovery. For in- 
stance, the "I'm Going Crazy" syndrome. It 
strikes early. Your worid blurs as if you are 
submerged. Life wobbles along in slow mo- 
tion. Making a decision becomes difGcult or 
impossible. Reaching the end of your tether, 
you conclude, "I'm going crazy." But you are 
not. Your are merely living through the pain- 
ful process of recovery. 

If you are a woman, almost certainly you will 
be afflicted with over-protection. Well- 
meaning and thick-headed males may take 
charge. Pastors and police are usually males. 
So are physicians, morticians, and cemetery 
lot salesmen. They want to be helpful but al- 
most without exception they impose their 
own code of chivalry on mothers, wives, and 
daughters. One issue is a women's right to 
view the body of her loved one. Most males 
are biased to the contraiy. Women are weak, 
unfitted for horrid sights. So they "protect" 
her. The men of the family are escorted to 
the mortuary. Not the woman. Recently, I 
read of a young mother whose need for a last 
look was denied by her menfolk. On the day 
of the funeral, she sat like a mad woman hug- 
ging the coffin in her arms until she was 
dragged away. Was her child really inside? 
We can be certain the question will haunt her 
all the days of her life. 

All this must be changed. But only feminine 
survivors can change it. To take a last loving 
look is their right. The change is coming and 
I hope soon. 

Another obstacle to deliverance from grief is 
what might be called Dangerous Days. Why 
dangerous? Because they bring to mind all 
the good things of one's past life. In a nor- 
mal life, the best days are usually Mother's 
day, Christmas, birthdays, and anniversaries. 
In one's post-suicide life, one learns to avoid 
them. One of the worst days is the first an-

niversary. The mind says, "Exactly one year 
ago, it happened. Right here in this room. I 
remember every detail." And the pain 
returns. But gradually one learns to dodge 
and to cope, and then you hate yourself for 
diminishing the goodness of the life you 
mourn. 

Occasionally, that self-hate thrusts you back 
into the abyss from which you have climbed 
and you feel doomed forever to eternal dam- 
nation. This too will pass. My daughter took 
the agony of her relapse to the same friend 
and guide who had counseled her in the 
beginning. Her attack was normal, he as- 
sured her. Ahnost certainly, it had originated 
in a remnant of her year-old grief. A rem- 
nant, he reminded her, was a fragment of 
something left over. She understood and her 
deliverance came quickly. 

We have not discussed how long deliverance 
from grief takes. Sometimes it lasts so long 
that it becomes an issue. Even old friends 
tend to magnify its length and to resent its 
persistence. A flesh wound usually heals 
quickly. A broken bone takes a bit longer. 
But a broken heart is bound to no time span. 
Impatient friends offer encouraging advice. 
"Let's get it over, fella! We've got a job to 
do." Or "Come on kiddol Stop your crying 
and pick up the pieces." 

Lucky, indeed, is the survivor who has a 
friend who understands that everyone 
recuperates in a different way and at a dif- 
ferent speed. Lucky, indeed, is the friend 
who can help a survivor to reach the peace- 
ful plateau of understanding that one never 
gets over such a loss but that presently one 
will learn to live with it. 

Along the way, many survivors wonder if they 
need help. For most, the answer is yes. Help 
may come from a professional or from a 
suicide survivor group. Hundreds of the lat- 
ter exist. Ask your doctor or your pastor. If 
you prefer a one-on-one relationship, ex- 
perts often recommend a trial run of three 
consecutive visits. Get to know each other, 
what goals he sets, what improvements he an- 
ticipates. If you prefer the caring com- 




3-150 



panionship of persons who have escaped 
from their own personal black hole, find a 
survivor group and listen to it. If you are on 
the same wavelength, there is no better 
therapy. 

The point I belabor is this: the casualties 
resulting from the suicide of a single teenager 
always extends far beyond his imagining. We 
know little about the path that he has chosen 
to follow but we know for certain that the ter- 
ritory he leaves behind is no Fun City. 

Eariier, I intimated that survivors have been 
neglected long enough. And I asked what 
services do they need most. My experience 
tells me that they need to know how others 
have felt in the same situation. Specifically, 
they need to be forewarned (as does the 
whole public) of the storms others have sur- 
vived and how able counselors have helped 
them to withstand the thunder and lightning. 
A perfect guidebook will never be written for 
every client. But our modem worid which 
mobilizes religion, psychology, and medicine 
to make us more comfortable offers so many 
choices. Somewhere help is available. 
Often, it is within one's own body. 

Patricia Sun, a California lecturer and healer, 
says this: "Every time you feel pain, every 
time you feel despair, every time you feel loss, 
rvery time you feel fear ... it is always your 
cutting edge." 

Some survivors who learn about the grief 
process feel cheated unless they are con- 
ducted through every emotional swamp and 
sinkhole. They must learn that no ladder vsdll 
ever help them to escape. A grieving youth 
who lost his mother spent months bouncing 
around until his life settled down. He 
reported, "You build your own grief process 
and you build your own recovery. It's not 
right or wrong or good or bad. It just is." 

Once one emerges, one becomes a member 
of a special brotherhood. Sascha Wagner, 
herself a survivor, describes them: "Some of 
us get desperate and we don't make it 
through. Others manage to make it and 
there is a specialness to such persons. They 
have an inheritance and they kind of become 

1^5 



C.Mitchell: Issues for Survivors 



a kind of living memorial to their dead 
children. Those who survive-that's us-- 
make the difference that keeps the trees 
growing." 

So what do we want? What beyond mere sur- 
vival? 

Here is my wish list: 

That we not be castigated by the stigma of a 
suicide that we neither solicited nor ap- 
proved. 

That our loved ones, now dead, not be con- 
signed to oblivion through talk that avoids 
their existence. 

That our productivity as good citizens be ac- 
cepted socially politically, and industrially. 

That the patience of our peers will allow us, 
each in his own way, to gain the strength we 
need to balance and carry our life-long bur- 
dens. 

That in due time we may be surprised by joy. 

Finally, I would beg for survivor research that 
will help educate families in the grief process. 

• Teach caregivers, educators, pastors and 
teenagers that liberation begins when 
isolation and depression and resentment 
are guided into productive channels. 

• Teach that the swiftest healing comes to 
those who seek a blessing amid the debris 
of their messed up lives. 

• Teach that suicide is no disgrace when H 
is chosen to meet a positive need, or e^ n 
to challenge an incredible fantasy. 

Surely, we live in a time of change for the bet- 
ter. Count the once-forbidden topics that 
have emerged from centuries of silence 
during our own generation. One can name 
women's rights, minority rights, abused 
children's rights, even Gay rights. 

It is time, at last, for survivor's rights.

PREVENTION OF ADOLESCENT SUICIDE AMONG 
AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKAN NATIVE PEOPLES 

James W. Thompson, M.D., M.P.H., Research Psychiatrist, Division of Biometry and Applied 
Sciences, National Institute of Mental Health, RockvUle, Maryland 



INTRODUCTION 

In 1985 there was yet another round of media 
attention to the phenomenon of adolescent 
suicide in American Indian and Alaskan Na- 
tive (hereafter, "Indian") communities. This 
has been a long-standing problem, and a 
topic which has been periodically 'Viewed 
with alarm" by the media. It is also a subset 
of a concern over similar recent trends in the 
majority population. Suic'de, in combination 
with high rates for other self-destructive be- 
haviors (e.g., homicide, accidents, substance 
abuse, unwed motherhood), has meant an 
ongoing destruction of Indian communities. 
It is appropriate, then, to talk about preven- 
tion of these self-destructive behaviors. 

Indian suicide is a topic which has been peri- 
odically written about in the professional 
literature. I will not attempt to review that 
literature, or to repeat the work of such re- 
searchers as Shore (1) or Beiser (2) in 
epidemiology, or Berlin (3,4) Levy and 
Kunitz (S), and Ward (6) in suicide preven- 
tion. Rather, I will make some general com- 
ments about adolescent suicide among 
Indian people, its epidemiology, and ap- 
proaches to its prevention. Some of these 
points have been made previously by the 
above and by other authors, but is important 
to review them. 

Data Problems 

There is an a priori assumption, often made 
in the press (and sometimes in the literature). 



of an "epidemic" of suicide among adolescent 
Indians. Despite the importance of sound 
epidemiologic data to define whether indeed 
an "epidemic" exists, only a few articles have 
used epidemiologic methods to define the ex- 
tent and shape of the problem of suicide 
among Indian adolescents. Such work is 
necessary as a basis for appropriate clinical 
and community action. Unfortunately, 
however, studies in the area of Indiansuicide 
present a multitude of difficulties. 

One problem is that suicide is a relatively rare 
event, especially in small populations such as 
Indian tribes. This is of concern because a 
very small change in raw numbers can look 
very large in terms of rates. These small 
changes (which result in large changes in 
rates) may be due to real changes in the 
prevalence in suicide, but can also result from 
problems in reporting suicide deaths. For ex- 
ample, different individuals from time to time 
may report and record suicide deaths in a 
community or county. They may or may not 
correctly identify Indians as Indians on death 
certificates. In additbn, they bring to the 
process different attitudes about suicide, 
which affect their definition of suicide and 
their willingness to report it. Indian com- 
munities themselves may be reluctant to 
identify suicides as such for fear of adverse 
publicity, and this reluctance may wax and 
wane. 

With regard to "epidemics" among Indian

peoplcperse, it is not clear that suicide rates 
are higher in Indian communities than for the 
surrounding areas. To evaluate this, it is im- 
portant to use contemporaneous data for 
comparison from the same general area as 
the Indian data before deciding that a 
problem is specifically an Indian problem. 
One frequent mistake is to compare the total 
U.S. suicide rate with the local Indian rate, or 
to compare both the total U.S. Indian and 
non-Indian rates. 

Using data from one or a few tribes to 
generalize to all Indian people presents 
another difficulty. There are, depending on 
the definition used, more than 400 identifi- 
able tribal groups in the United States, which 
are quite diverse with regard to size and cul- 
ture. To assume that suicide rates, reasons 
for suicide, and potential solutions to suicide 
among tribes are identical, or even similar, is 
a serious mistake. For sample, there are 
large differences in rates and patterns of 
suicide between Navajo and Hopi, the latter 
of whom is completely surrounded by the 
former. Such differences are eas.'ly 
"swamped" in reporting figures for large 
areas. 

Related to the problem of tribal diversity is 
the paucity of the data on non-reservation In- 
dians. Less than half of Indians live on reser- 
vations; the remainder live in urban or rural 
communities, often far from reservations. It 
would be a serious mistake to assume that the 
nature and extent of the problem is the same 
for all of these communities. Studies that at- 
tempt to group these communities together 
may present an erroneous picture. 

Finally, there is a problem of what data are 
included by the various sources to determine 
suicide rates. For example, the Indian 
Health Service (IHS) areas have changed 
over time as have the definitions of an IHS 
"reservation state". Using IHS data to look 
at suicide trends, therefore, may present a 
problem. 

Two Studies 

Two examples of attempts to deal with the 



data problems follow. 

Pam Thurman sought data on suicide in 
Cherokee County, Oklahoma and also talked 
with people who could fill the gaps in the 
data. (She herself is a member of the com- 
munity, which allowed her access to such in- 
formal data sources.) She found that the 
suicide rate among Cherokees was not dif- 
ferent from the white suicide rate in the 
county (7). 

In the second study. Levy and Kunitz found 
that suicide rates varied widely within the 
Hopi tribe, that suicides were often clustered 
within particular families, and that the Hopi 
rates rose and fell with that of other rural 
counties of Arizona (8). 

To understand the problem of adolescent In- 
dian suicide better, we clearly need further 
epidemiologic ?.nd services research. We 
need to look more closely at small, 
homogeneous areas, using appropriate com- 
parison groups (e.g., local rates for non-In- 
dians). We need better methods for 
collecting vital statistics including working 
closely with the tribes in a way that doesn't 
penalize them for reporting suicides, e.g., 
providing the press with another sensational 
story. In addition, data need to be inter- 
preted in light of the culture of the com- 
munity and in light of its rural or urban 
character. 

With regard to services, research is needed 
on how the presence or absence of particular 
services, treatment personnel, or treatment 
facilities affects suicide rates. 

Finally, what "protects" some communities 
against suicide? This can be as revealing as 
learning about the communities with high 
rates. Here, we could and should study the 
similarities and differences between areas 
with high or low suicide rates. 

Strategies for Im^; >ving thie 
Situation 

The first consideration in dealing with a 
problem is to be sure that it really is a 
problem. Suicide and other self-destructive

behaviors are always found in a population, 
and even one case is cause for concern. 
There also may be peaks from time to time in 
the baseline rates of suicide in a community, 
just as there are in diseases and other social 
maladies, and these certainly constitute a 
reason for specific response in that com- 
munity. If an "epidemic" does occur, a more 
general response may be appropriate. 
Before responding, howe\'er, epidemiologic 
data should be obtained using methods which 
are congruent with the particular situation. 
To rely on news reports of a high suicide rate, 
or on national aggregate statistics as a ration- 
ale to move into a particular community or 
group of communities with large-scale plans 
to "fix" the problem may be grossly inap- 
propriate, a waste of resources, and damag- 
ing to the community. 

When going into a community, whether to 
collect data or mount a program, it is ab- 
solutely necessary to work with community 
representatives initially and throughout the 
project and to conform with the culture and 
beliefs of the particular community. This is 
true in any community, but especially in In- 
dian communities, for Indian people have 
learned from long experience that when the 
white man wants to study them or help them 
with a new program, the outcome stands a 
very good chance of being negative. Finally, 
a solution in one community may be totally 
ineffective and inappropriate in another 
community, even if the communities are 
nearby or seem similar in many ways. 

It is also very important to understand suicide 
as one of several self-destructive behaviors 
which are "end-stage" behaviors. It is seldom 
that someone dies a self-inflicted death 
without previous events or conditions which 
led to the fmal behavior. The specifics of 
these previous events or conditions are key 
to the prevention and treatment of self- 
destructive behaviors. Although "end-stage" 
services (such as suicide crisis centers) are 
useful, prevention and treatment must begin 
much earlier. To rely on interventions at the 
last stage is analogous to trying to prevent 
renal disease by providing services to people 




3-154 



ready for dialysis. We must also find ways to 
look more definitively at several causes of 
death which may have a co'nmon etiology in- 
stead of looking separately at suicide, al- 
coholism, homicide, and accident statistics. 

Prevention 

How, then, can we prevent suicide in Indian 
youth? Some foci include: 

1. Improving socioeconomic conditions. 
This is not a direct concern of psychiatric and 
other health care personnel and programs, 
but must be included as one of the keys to in- 
fluencing self-destructive behaviors. Specifi- 
cally with regard to Indians, until there is a 
solid economic base on reservations and in 
other Indian communities, it will be very dif- 
ficult to alter the rates of these negative be- 
haviors. The effective involvement of 
qualified Indian people in the process of 
economic and political development is a 
"must" (although simply terminating all help, 
in the name of "self-determination", is very 
destructive). 

2. Recognizing and treating underlying 
psychiatric disorders, providing services for 
Indian people which are adequate in number 
and quality, and coordinating with other 
health services. Gearly, many psychiatric 
disorders, mild and severe, are important risk 
factors for suicide and other self- destructive 
behaviors. Many of the disorders of youth 
which can lead to suicide are treatable. In 
spite of this, the mental health programs of 
the IHS have been chronically under-funded; 
mental health, alcoholism, drug abuse, and 
general health services are often separated 
administratively and functionally; and there 
are far too few qualified treatment profes- 
sionals in the mental health, alcoholism, and 
drug abuse treatment programs. Also, be- 
cause mental health services are so 
decentralized in the IHS, there is little 
development of national or even regional 
strategies for effective service delivery. 

The majority of Indians are healthy, perhaps 
even healthier overall than at any time since 
the European invasion of the continent. But 



15.') 



J.W. Thompson: Prevention. . Among American Indian. . . 



a great prevention challenge remains in help- 
ing adolescents and parents who suffer from 
alcoholism, drug abuse, and other psychiatric 
disorders. Case-finding, effective service 
delivery, and improved services/Terse are es- 
sential in terms of early identification and 
treatment of pathology which leads self- 
destructive behaviors. 

3. Coordinating health (including mental 
health, alcoholism, and drug abuse) services 
with other human services. It is important to 
work with schools, employers, tribal leader- 
ship, and families in dealing with self-destruc- 
tive behaviors. A key actor is the primary 
care physician who is in an excellent position 
to recognize and deal with factors which may 
lead to violent behavior. This role may in- 
clude treating the patient, referring to 
qualified psychiatric specialty care, and 
making connections between schools, 
families, etc., thereby building a care-giving 
network or system for the troubled youth. 
This means dealing with basic problems early, 
not waiting for the last stage behaviors. 

4. Addressing culture conflicts among 
young people. There is often an enormous 
conflict between the white and Indian cul- 
tures, which profoundly influences youths 
who are forming their personal identities. 
Having meaningful cultural experiences, as 
well as helping youth to deal with white cul- 
ture vis a vis their Indian culture, are impor- 
tant in the community, the family, and the 
schools. Some active treatment programs 
that address this conflict can be adopted as 
prevention models. Thc:/^ include the model 
boarding school on the Navajo reservation 
(9), and the Rainbow Lodge alcoholism 
treatment program in Canada (6). 

We have spoken about primary prevention 
(prevention of self- destructive behavior, per 
se), and of secondary prevention (early 
recognition and treatment of conditions 
which may lead to self-destructive behavior). 
Equally important is tertiary prevention: 
providing appropriate foUowup services to 
Indian youth who have received active 
psychiatric treatment or who have actually 
engaged in self-destructive behavior. This 



must be done with a recognition that the 
alienation which Indian youths feel toward 
the care-giving system can be profound. 
Therefore, active outreach must be per- 
formed in a culturally sensitive way. 

CONCLUSION 

Suicide and other self-destructive behaviors 
in Indian youth are not new problems. At the 
present time we do not have the information 
to determine the extent and shape of the 
problem in a given Indian community at a 
given point in time. From time to time, 
awareness of problems surfaces outside of 
the Indian community, but this may not be so 
much discovery of "epidemic/ but rather 
highlighting a particular community at a par- 
ticular time. Prevention needs to be aimed 
not to the communities which have most 
recently made the press, but rather at com- 
munities which can be demonstrated by 
epidemiologic research to have a problem 
needing a specialized response. That 
response must be scaled to fit the nature and 
extent of the problem, not simply reacting 
with large scale initiatives when less expen- 
sive measures are called for. Both the 
gathering of data and the planning of respon- 
ses should be done in conjunction with the 
tribes themselves, with unobstrusive 
measures and with cultural sensitivity. We 
should remember that the challenge is not 
just suicide, but all self-destructive behaviors, 
all of which are interwoven with one another. 
Finally, we should not be satisfied with 
prevention only at the "end stage", but work 
towards early recognition and treatment of 
conditions, social and psychiatric, which lead 
over time to self-destructive behaviors.

SUICIDE AMONG ASIAN AMERICAN YOUTH

Since the mid-1960s, the media have 
portrayed the positive stereotype of Asian 
American youth as a special population who 
work hard to pull themselves up by their 
bootstraps (New York Times Magazine, 
January 9, 1966; U.S. News and World Report, 
December 26, 1966; Time Magazine, March 
28, 1983; Sunday Chicago Sun-Times, 
January 22, 1984; Chicago Tribune, January 
IS, 1986). Little attention, if any, was placed 
on the social problems faced by young Asian 
Americans in their struggle to excel and to es- 
tablish themselves in the U.S. society. 
Similarly, research on suicide among Asian 
American minorities has not focused on the 
age group IS to 24 years old, but have instead 
tended to highlight the problems of the elder- 
ly (e.g.. Bourne, 1973; Mcintosh and Santos, 
1981). 

OBJECTIVES 

This paper fills the knowledge gap concern- 
ing Asian and white American youth suicide 
by examining the national suicide data for 
two time periods in the age range 15 to 24 



years. Aside from the apparent need for a 
descriptive database, such a comparison ser- 
ves four other objectives: (1) to determine 
the magnitude and direction of the ethnic dif- 
ferences in youth suicide between Asian and 
white Americans; (2) to examine the chan- 
ges in the suicide rate over time between the 
different groups; and (3) to explore plausible 
factors for the observed ethnic differences in 
Asian American youth suicide; and (4) to dis- 
cuss the implications of the research findings 
from a prevention perspective. 

Many of the findings in this paper are based 
on data extracted from death certificate 
records and submitted by each of the SO 
States to the National Center for Health 
Statistics (NCHS). Created in 1960, NCHS 
is mandated to collect, analyze, and dissemi- 
nate statistical and epidemiologic data on the 
health of the nation. Because the size of the 
Asian American population has remained 
numerically insignificant until recently, na- 
tional mortality data for this special popula- 
tion are difficult to analyze and interpret 
even though they have existed for some time 
at NCHS. Furthermore, since analyses of

such data require population denominators 
collected by the Bureau of the Census, the 
absence of intercensal estimates for Asian 
Americans in general and Chinese and 
Japanese in particular, has severely limited 
the use of these records for research pur- 
poses. For these reasons, meaningful cal- 
culation of suicide rates can be made only for 
the years 1970^ and 1980. 

Of the 40-some Asian American subgroups 
enumerated in the last census, only the 
suicide statistics for Chinese and Japanese 
Americans will be presented in this paper for 
reasons of availability of data and confidence 
in the quality of the data^. This decision 
should not be interpreted to mean that the 
statistics obtained for these two older Asian 
American groups in any way represent all 
Asian Americans. In the strictest sense, the 
term Asian Americans is a meaningful con- 
cept only insofar as it identifies the 
geographic origins of a group of people who 
are visibly and culturally different from the 
majority white population, however, the 
population itself is comprised of a number of 
diverse groups which, in many ways, are as 
different from one another as they are dif- 
ferent from other races. 

It should also be stated that mortality data in 
general, being collected primarily for legal 
purposes, have their inherent limitations. 
Reporting or claf^ification errors are pos- 
sible. The magnitude of errors may vaiy by 
State as well as by specific information (e.g., 
sex may be more accurately recorded than 
ethnicity). Although many studies assess. >^

quality of medical recording in death certifi- 
cates, such studies have not been targeted to 
a specific population such as the Asian 
Americans. We do not know, therefore, the 
extent of underreporting or misreporting of 
race or of cause of death for Asian Americans 
other than what Yu (1982) reviewed in her 
earlier work on infant mortality. This ac- 
knowledgement of the limitations of data 
must also be balanced by an appreciation of 
the fact that the United States probably has 
one of the bstter maintained vital registra- 
tion systems of all modem nations, and mor- 
tality data extracted from death certificates 
are our only source of statistics on suicides. 
Thus, in the absence of alternative sources of 
statistics on suicide, we are forced to use the 
death certificate data. Caution, however, is 
clearly warranted in the interpretation of 
these statistics. 

SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC 
PROFILE OF ASIAN 
AMERICAN YOUTH 

Unpublished data based on 100 percent 
count of the U.S. Census show that there 
were only 89,342 Chinese Americans and 
96^059 Japanese Americans between 15 and 
24 years of age in 1970 (Liu and Yu, 1975). 
This age group represented 20.5 percent of 
the total Chinese American population and 
16.2 percent of the total Japanese American 
population at the time (Table 1). (All tables 
appear at the end of this chapter.) By 1980, 
the number of 15 to 24 year olds increased by 
63.5 percent (to 146,035) for Chinese 
Americans, and 25.4 percent (to 120,443) for 
Japanese Americans, compared to only 11.7 
percent increase for white Americans. 

Table 2 shows the school enrollment pattern 
of 15 to 24 year olds by nativity and sex, based 
on the 1980 Census. In eveiy age group ex- 
amined (15-24, 15-19, and 20-24 years), white 
Americans have the largest percentage not 
enrolled in school followed by Japanese 
Americans. Chinese Americans consistently 
have the lowest percentage not enrolled in 
school. Their rate, for the most part, is 



liV3 



E.Yu: Suicide among Asian American Youth 



roughly half that found for white Americans. 
This is true regardless of nativity and sejr. In 
the late teens (15-19 years of age), the per- 
centage of Chinese not in school is only about 
one-third of that for white Americans. Since 
this is true for both foreign- and native-bom, 
cultural transmission of values concerning 
the importance of education in the Asian 
American communities is probably far more 
important than selective immigration per se 
in explaining the differential rates of school 
enrollment between these ethnic groups. 

The employment status of persons 15-24 
years old who are not in school is shown in 
Table 3. Among foreign-bom males not in 
school, the employment rate of white 
Americans is the highest of the three ethnic 
groups compared. About 82 percent of white 
Americans, 77 percent of Chinese 
Americans, and 73 percent of Japanese 
American youth who are not attending 
school are employed. Among foreign-bora 
females, a larger percentage of Chinese and 
Japanese American youth (67 and 58 per- 
cent, respectively) are employed compared 
to white Americans (53 percent). 

Among native-bora males, the employment 
rate of white and Chinese Americans are 
similar (about 79 percent), both being some- 
what lower than that found for Japanese 
Americans (85 percent). For native-bora 
females, white American youth have the 
lowest employment rate (65 percent) com- 
pared to Chinese (84 percent) and Japanese 
Americans (81 percent). It appears that na- 
tive-born Asian American women are 
shouldering the responsibility of productive 
employment at a young age, probably to sup- 
port themselves as well as their parents and 
siblings. 

An examination of the employment status of 
those who are in school shows that among the 
foreign bom 15-24 year olds, Japanese have

inclusive. The differences between ethnic groupt are sutis-

comparison of household type between white and Chinese 
Americans who immigrated before 1970 presented in Table

the lowest percentage of persons who are 
working while going to school (Table 3). 
This is true for males (26 percent, compared 
to 30 percent for Chinese and 32 percent for 
white Americans) as well as females (28 per- 
cent, compared to 34 percent for Chinese 
and 31 percent for white Americans). 

Among the U.S. -born youth, white 
Americans have the lowest percentage of 
persons who are working while going to 
school (36 percent for males and 35 percent 
for females), while Japanese Americans con- 
sistently have the highest percentage of per- 
sons who are both employed and in school 
(42 percent for males and 43 percent for 
females). Among foreign-bora youth, the 
findings are just the opposite. Japanese 
American males and females have the lowest 
percentage of persons who are working and 
going to school, while the Chinese and white 
Americans have similar rates. 

Household type information on the IS to 24 
year olds are shown in Table 4. Among U.S.- 
born youth, the percentage of persons living 
in a married couple household varies from 
643 percent for Chinese Americans, 65.4 
percent for Japanese Americans, to 67.5 per- 
cent for white Americans. However, the per- 
centage of youth living alone, in group 
quarters, or in nonfamily households shows 
somewhat greater variability, with the 
Chinese having the largest percentage (25.6 
percent) of the three groups living in these 
"other" type of households. No doubt this is 
due to the high percentage of Chinese na- 
tive-bora youth who are enrolled in school, 
compared with the other two groups. 

For foreign-bora youth, the data in Table 4 
are broken down by year of immigration. A 
larger percentage of Asian Americans who 
were between the ages of 15 and 24 in 1980 
and who immigrated to the United States in 
the 1970s are either living in group quarters 
or in nonfamily households. Again, this is 
most likely due to the large numbers of Asian 
Americans who are enrolled in school and 
living apart from their family. Japanese 
American youth who immigrated during the 
1970s have a disproportionately large per-

centage (around 13 percent) living alone, 
compared with the other two groups (no 
more than 5 percent). Why this is so is far 
from clear. 

AGE-SPECIFIC SUICIDE 
RATES: 1C^70 and 1980 

Tables 5 and 6 show the average annual age- 
specific and age-adjusted suicide death rates 
for white, Chinese, and Japanese Americans 
in 1980 and 1970, respectively. Following the 
convention of the National Center for 
Health Statistics where these data are 
managed, the U.S. population in 1940 was 
used as the standard population for age ad- 
justment 

Across time and for all ethnic groups in 1980, 
male suicide death rates in the IS to 24 age 
range have exceeded female rates. With a 
suicide rate of 13.79 per 100,000 population 
in 1970, which increased to 21.91 per 100 000 
in 1980, white American male youth have . ^ 
highest suicide rates among the three ethnic 
groups compared. Overtime, there was a 
58.9 percent increase in suicide rates among 
white males IS to 24 years old. The Chinese 
American male suicide rate increased even 
more (by 122.3 percent) from 3.63 per 
100,000 population in 1970 to 8.07 in 1980. 

On the other hand, although Japanese 
American male suicide rates (11.97 per 
100,000 in 1970 and 14.09 per 100,000 in 
1980) have been higher than the Chinese 
rates, the rate of increase in suicide rates over 
time is not as dramatic as that found for 
Chinese Americans. 

Given the populatioi creases that each of 
the three ethnic groups have experienced 
over time (see Table 1), the question arises 
as to whether the increase in suicide rates be- 
tween 1970 and 1980 may be a result of the 
population growth. A closer examination of 
the data show that the percent population in- 
crease is 13.7 percent for white male IS to 24 
year olds, 63.1 percent for Chinese Amen'can 
youth, and 30.6 percent for Japanese 
Americans. In short, the ratio of the rate of 
change in suicide rates to the rate of popula- 



3-160 



tion increase is highest for white American 
youth (4.3), lowest for Japanese Americans 
(1.7), and intermediate for Chinese 
Americans (1.9). This finding indicates that 
factors other than population growth ex- 
plains the increase in suicide rate over time. 

By comparison, suicide rates for white 
American females IS to 24 years old have not 
changed significantly between the two census 
years. (4.21 per 100,000 in 1970 compared to 
S.OO in 1980) even though the population 
within this age range has increased by about 
10 percent. The suicide death rate for 
Chinese American females increased by S9.2 
percent, which is less than the 63.8 percent 
increase in the population of females in the 
same age group, while the suicide death rates 
for Japanese American females dropped 
slightly from S.S1 per 100,000 in 1970 to 4.S2 
per 100,000 in 1980, during which time the 
population had actually increased by 20.3 
percent. 

On the basis of the age-specific death rates 
and the above ratios, some readers may con- 
clude that suicide is not a major public health 
problem for Asian American youth, com- 
pared with white Americans. However, an 
examination of the proportional mortality 
statistics gives a different picture of the find- 
ings. 

PROPORTIONAL MORTAUTY 
FOR SELECTED DEATHS 

While the age-specific rate for any cause of 
death is calculated using the population size 
of a given group as the denominator and the 
number of deaths from a specific cause for 
that particular group as the numerator; 
proportional mortality for any cause of death 
is obtained by using the total number of 
deaths for any given popula'* in as the 
denominator and the specific caw ^ of death 
as the numerator. Because of the differen- 
ces in the denominator, it is possible for these 
two rates to give apparently contradictory in- 
formation. 

Table 7 presents the proportional mortality 
rates for suicide deaths by ethnicity in 1970 

ICS 



E.Yu: Suicide among Asian American Youth 



compared with 1980. One notes that suicide 
accounts for a much larger proportion of 
deaths among Asian American youth in 1980 
than among white Americans. Among males, 
for instance, suicide represents 21.3 percent 
of all deaths for Japanese Americans, 15.1 
percent for Chinese Americans and only 12.9 
percent for white Americans. Among 
females, it constitutes 20.8 percent of all 
deaths for Chinese Americans, 14 percent for 
Japanese Americans, and 8.8 percent for 
white Americans^. 

There is another way of examining the 
proportional mortality data in Table 7, that 
is, making within-group comparisons over 
time. In this case, the percentage change in 
average annual proportional mortality for 
Chinese American 15-24 year olds between 
1969-71 and 1979-81 is striking (200 percent 
for both s^es) compared to white (53 per- 
cent) or Japanese Americans (33 percent). 

However, it is important to stress that, to 
begin with, Japanese American proportional 
mortality rates had been very high in 1969-71, 
and they remained high in 1979-81, whereas 
the Chinese American rates were veiy low in 
1%9-71 and they increased dramatically in 
1979-81. From a public health standpoint, 
this increase in proportional mortality rate 
over time for all three ethnic groups is cause 
for concern. It is therefore a serious miscon- 
ception to rely solely upon the age-specific 
suicide rate of 15-24 year olds and conclude 
that Chinese American youth do not have a 
suicide problem. What is a "high" or "low" 
suicide rate depends on what group or what 
year is used as the reference point for com- 
parison purposes. 

The high proportional mortality rates among 
Chinese Americans relative to their low age- 
specific death rates are most likely a conse- 
quence of competing causes of death. As a 

4. Unfortunately, due to the exceedingly small denominators 
of Chinese and Japanese Americans in comparison with 
white Americans, application of statistical tests of sig- 
niricance fails to produce a p-vaiue of .05 or less. Strictly 
speaking, then, no firm conclusions can be reached regard* 
ing the statistical significance of thesedifferent proportion- 
al morality rates despite the fact that in some instances 
(e.g., Chinese female youth) the proportional death rate is 
more than two times that of the white female rate. 



rule, deaths due to accidents has ahvays been 
one of, if not the, major competing cause of 
death for persons in the age range of 15 to 24 
years. So long as the proportional mortality 
r^tes for accidents remain very high, if not the 
highest, of all causes of death, the proportion 
of deaths from suicide can be expected to 
remain relatively low. This becomes ap- 
parent when one calculates the potential 
years of life lost for different causes of death, 
as shown below. 

POTENTIAL YEARS OF LIFE 
LOST 

Using the 10 leading causes of death for the 
United States, Table 8 represents the dis- 
tribution of average-annual potential years 
of life lost before age 85 for Chinese and 
Japanese who die at age 15 or older. Poten- 
tial years of life lost before age 85 are calcu- 
lated by totaling the remaining years until age 
85 for each person who committed suicide in 
his/her youth (i.e., in the age range between 
15-24 years). For example, a person dying at 
age 20 would contribute 65 years to the total, 
while one who dies at age 70 contributes only 
15 years. With this indicator it is possible to 
rank the different causes of death while in- 
cluding only deaths before age 85 and giving 
more weight to early deaths. 

Of the 10 leading causes of death presented 
in Table 8, potential years of life lost can be 
calculated for only 6 of them. This suggests 
that for Chinese Americans, the remaining 
four leading causes of death (diabetes mel- 
litus. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Dis- 
ease, Cirrhosis of the Liver, and 
Arteriosclerosis) occur at such older ages 
that the potential years of life lost ap- 
proaches, if not equals, zero. 

In terms of selecting health promotion and 
prevention priorities, the ranking of causes 
of death according to potential years of life 
lost is more useful than ranking causes of 
death according to the total number of 
deaths. A death at the age of 20 or older has 
a different impact, at least to the family and 
to society at large, than a death at the age of 



3-161 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



80 yean. 

Furthermore, because calculation of the 
potential years of life lost is affected by the 
population size as well as by the age-specific 
death rates, it is more interesting to compare 
the potential years of life lost between groups 
for each cause of death rather than to look at 
the absolute figures themsehres. Table 8 
shows that all three ethnic groups have 
similar rankings of the potential years of life 
lost at age IS or older for the 10 leading 
causes of death in the United States. Acci- 
dents head the list, followed by suicide. Thus, 
suicide is a serious problem in the Asian 
American population just as it is in the white 
American population. 

However, the groups differ greatly in the per- 
centage of potential years of life lost due to 
a particular cause of death. Accidents, for 
example, account for 73 percent or nearly 
three-quarters of the average annual poten- 
tial years of life lost for white Americans who 
die at the age of IS or older during 1979-81, 
while th^ account for only 4S percent for 
Chinese Americans and S8 percent for 
Japanese Americans. On the other hand, 
suicide accounts for a much higher percent- 
age of potential years of life lost for Chinese 
(28 {.ercent) and Japanese (2S percent) 
Americans, compared to only IS percent 
among white Americans. 

Those concerned with the identification of 
major public health problems are well ad- 
vised to GxaminG the distribution of potential 
years of life lost, as a first step to defining 
priorities. As a second step, rates of poten- 
tial years of life lost should be considered for 
identifying trends over time. 

Table 9 shows the average annual potential 
years of life lost by 10 leading causes of death 
for ages IS to 24 years in 1969-71. The data 
indicate a higher percentage of potential 
years of life lost due to suicide for Japanese 
youth (18 percent) compared to Chinese (8.1 
percent) and white Americans (10 percent). 
By 1979-81, it is the Chinese youth who had 
the highest percentage of potential years of 
life lost to suicide (28 percent) compared to 



Japanese (2S percent) and white Americans 
(IS percent). 

THE NATIVITY FACTOR 

Nativity, or the decedent's place of birth, is 
an important factor in Asian American mor- 
tality analysis. It is generally taken as a proxy 
measure for cultural upbringing and 
socioeconomic lifestyle, given the limited in- 
formation available from the death certifi- 
cate. In addition to age and sex, nativity is an 
important risk factor in the analysis of Asian 
American mortality data because among 
Chinese Americans lS-24 years of age, 60 
percent are foreign-bom, compared with 
21.4 percent for Japanese Americans and 4.3 
percent for white Americans. The variability 
in the proportion of foreign-bom raises the 
question as to whether there are nativity dif- 
ferences in suicide mortality rates for Asian 
American youth compared with white 
Americans. Unfortunately, the nativity in- 
formation is not available in the national 
mortality data tapes for 1969-71. Analysis of 
the variable is thus confined only to the 1980 
data set. 

Table 10 shows that at each age group, the 
suicide death rate for foreign-bora youth is 
consistently higher than that found for the 
native-bora. In the lS-24 age range, the rate 
for foreign-bora Chinese is 7.1 per 100,000 
population compared with 5.2 for native- 
bom youth. For Japanese Americans, the 
nativity ratio is higher-the rate being 14.3 
per 100,000 for the foreign-bora youth com- 
pared with 8.1 for the native-bora. 

Clearly, suicide is a serious problem in the 
Asian American population, and more 
foreign-born youth are at risk than the na- 
tive- born. Any prevention efforts should 
pay strong attention to the foreign born 
Asian American youth if we are to reduce ef- 
fectively the overall suicide rates. 

DISCUSSION 

The study of suicide as a socio-cultural 
phenomenon is a classic one, dating as far 



l(i7 



E.Yu: Suicide among Asian American Youth 



backas Durkheim's classic work (1897, trans- 
lated by Spaulding and Simpson, 1951). His 
innovative approach to the study of suicide 
involves inter-societal comparisons of 
suicide statistics over time and among dif- 
ferent segments of the population~an ap- 
proach which emerged as a result of his 
concern over societal integration and the na- 
ture of group cohesion. 

Insofar as research on Asian American 
suicide is concerned, the work has barely 
begun. This paper is perhaps one of the very 
first efforts at exploring the National Center 
for Health Statistics' archival death files to 
analyze the inter-ethnic differences in 
suicide rates among Asian American youth. 
Previous efforts had been targeted to specific 
local areas, such as San Francisco (Bourne, 
1973) or Hawaii, or to age groups other than 
age 15 to 24. It is obvious that we have bare- 
ly scratched the tip of the iceberg on Asian 
American suicide at the national level. 

What we have learned is that making inter- 
ethnic comparisons at one point in time has 
distinct disadvantages in that when the 
suicide rates for the reference population (in 
this case, white American youth) are high, 
Asian American rates always appear low by 
contrast. If one were to examine the Asian 
American suicide rates over time, however, 
one quickly discovers that these rates have in- 
creased dramatically. The reasons for their 
increase are not yet clearly understood, much 
less studied. 

We must admit that, theoretically, we have 
no adequate explanation, as yet for the lower 
age-specific suicide rates for Chinese and 
Japanese Americans as a group, compared to 
white Americans. One possibility is that 
overall rates for the 10 leading causes of 
death are lower for the two Asian American 
groups than for white Americans (Yu et al., 
1985). Similarly, their age-specific suicide 
statistics are also lower than that found for 
white Americans. Thus, any Asian-white 
comparison of rates would always lead to the 
conclusion that the former appear to have 
few health or social problems. 



Nonetheless, as we have demonstrated in this 
paper, whenever proportional mortality 
rates are used for purposes of comparison, a 
different picture emerges. Proportional 
suicide rates are higher for Asian Americans 
than for white Americans, and these rates 
have increased dramatically over a ten-year 
period. 

An examination of the Census data indicates 
that Asian American youth are characterized 
by high enrollment in school, and State-level 
data indicate that they have low drop-out 
rates compared with white Americans (Yu, 
Doi, and Chang, 1985). The media have 
played an important role in highlighting the 
academic achievements of Asian American 
school-age children. What has not been em- 
phasized is the psychological pressure and 
emotional scars that the young have endured 
in order to sustain the expectations of 
parents and school teachers alike. 

Sociologically, it is important to realize that 
over the last twenty years, the United States 
has experienced an unprecedented influx of 
Asian immigrants whose educational levels 
and professional skills are at the highest 
levels compared to the earlier waves of Asian 
immigrants and European settlers. In the 
United States today, the proportion of Asian 
Americans with four years or more college is 
significantly higher than that of white 
Americans. Although the occupational 
return on education has not been as high for 
Asian Americans as one might expect had 
they been white Americans, large percent- 
ages of Chinese and Japanese Americans still 
hold high-prestige jobs compared with white 
Americans. This cohort of highly-educated 
professionals are concentrated in the 40-55 
years age range, the age of parenthood with 
children in school. 

In interview after interview with Asian 
American high achievers, the public learned 
from the media that the children explained 
their drive to excel in terms of the shame that 
can befall their parents should they fail, and 
the glory they bring to their parents when 
they succeed. It comes as no surprise that we 
have a cohort of high-achieving Asian 



3-163 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



American parents who are putting tremen- 
dous pressure on their children to become 
even more successful then they are. The in- 
tensified pressure, and the sudden awareness 
of Asian American teenagers about their 
self-identity problems, are likely causes for 
the increased suicide rates among Asian 
Americans between 1970 and 1980. Native- 
bom Chinese and Japanese in particular 
have a certain vulnerability in their self-con- 
cept in that most of them do not speak their 
parents' language but are still perceived by 
the society at large to be non-native 
Americans. However, the foreign-born 
Asian American youth faces perhaps even 
more inner turmoil because of the inevitable 
clash of values held by their immigrant 
parents and the larger society, especially 
their American peers. The most recent U.S. 
Census data presented earlier (see Table 4) 
also show that, at least among the foreign- 
born Japanese American youth, a significant 
number (60 percent) of those who im- 
migrated in 1975-80 are living in households 
with no parents-that is, they either live 
alone, in group quarters, or in non-family 
households. The comparable figure for 
Chinese American youth who immigrated 
during that same period is 26 percent, which 
is also significantly higher than the rate for 
foreign-bom white Americans (21 percent). 
Among those who immigrated in 1970-74, 
some 4S percent of the Japanese American 
youth and 16 percent of the Chinese youth 
are living in households without a parental 
figure, compared to only 6.5 percent of the 
white American youth. These findings sug- 
gest that a substantial percentage of Asian 
American youth are living without im- 
mediate familial support-a source of social 
support critical during the teenage years and 
early adulthood, especially for the uprooted 
(i.e., the foreign born). Much research 
remains to be coaducted to examine the 
psychodynamics of the Asian American fami- 
ly, and the relationship between educational 
achievement and suicide among the young. 



RECOMMENDATIONS 

To date, the only source of information on 
Asian American suicide comes from the 
death certificate data submitted by each of 
the 50 States to the National (>nter for 
Health Statistics. Death registration is 
generally regulated by State laws which con- 
form to a 1959 Model Act developed by the 
State registrars of vital records under the 
leadership of the National Office of Vital 
Statistics. Since disposing of a corpse 
without a permit is a serious violation, the 
registration of deaths in all but the most iso- 
lated areas is believed to be almost 100 per- 
cent. However, having a relative who 
commits suicide is a shameful experience for 
surviving relatives. Attempts to misreport 
suicide as an accident or as another type of 
death probably exist to an unknown degree 
among all ethnic groups. We do not know if 
such misreporting of the cause of death is 
greater for Asian Americans than for white 
Americans. If it is higher, such errors have 
not been accounted for in our statistical 
tables. 

We believe that a far more serious problem 
lies not in the registration of death itself, but 
in the recording of the personal particulars 
about the deceased. A report prepared by 
the National Center for Health Statistics 
(Woolsey, 1968) indicates that such par- 
ticulars are usually filled out by the funeral 
director, who obtains the information from a 
surviving relative. The funeral director also 
takes the certificate to the attending 
physician (or in the case of an unattended or 
violent death, to the medical examiner or 
coroner) for completion of what is known as 
the "medical certification of cause of death." 
lliis portion of the death certificate requires 
the signature of the physician or medical- 
legal ofilcer. There is no built-in mechanism 
to check the accuracy of the funeral 
director's identification or recording of the 
race item on the death certificate. Strictly 
speaking, questions remain as to the accuracy 
of the information even when such informa- 
tion is obtained from a surviving relative. To 
what extent, for example, do the survivors of 



3-164 



E.Yu: Suicide among Asian American Youth 



a fourth-generation Japanese American 
identify the decedent as Japanese in 
response to the "race" item on the death cer- 
tificate? Although we have no empirical data 
to verify the accuracy of race recording, we 
suspect that, if there were gross errors, the 
unintentional misreporting of race is probab- 
ly greater among the native-bom than among 
the foreign-bom. The latter have a stronger 
ethnic identity than the former. Besides, the 
more monolingual native-born Asian 
Americans are, the more likely their 
"American-ness" will lead to their being clas- 
sified as white. This is of course pure 
speculation emboldened by the absence of 
data. 

Additionally, the National Center for Health 
Statistics issues to the 50 States model forms 
of the U.S. Standard Certificates each 
decade, and the States usually, but not al- 
ways, adhere to these in printing their own 
forms. Therefore, not all 50 States collect 
sufficiently specific race/ethnic information 
to allow for the systematic identification of 
Asian American subgroups such as Chinese, 
Japanese, Filipino, Korean, Vietnamese, 
Asian Indian, and others. 

Three recommendations can be made to as- 
certain the accuracy, if not to help minimize 
the misreporting of race or ethnic informa- 
tion on the death certificate. First, States 
which have not provided sufficiently detailed 
information on Asian American subgroups in 
their death certificates should be encouraged 
to do so. Increasingly, Asian Americans are 
no longer concentrated in just a few States. 
Perhaps the United States National Commit- 
tee on Vital and Health Statistics can be en- 
couraged to discuss this matter in their future 
meetings. 

Second, a special study can be made to do a 
follow-back mortality survey of a probability 
sample of suicides occurring to white, black, 
and Asian Americans, in order to ascertain 
the accuracy of the race or ethnic ojding. For 
reasons of cost containment, such a study can 
be limited to States with the largest con- 
centration of Asian Americans: Hawaii, 
California, New York, Illinois, Texas and 



Washington. The inclusion of States which 
are recently experiencing the growing 
presence of Asian Americans-such as Il- 
linois, Washington, and Texas-is important 
since the accuracy of the race/ethnic code 
may well vary with the density of Asian 
American population in a given geographic 
area. Methodological studies on the quality 
of the death certificates have been con- 
ducted by the National Center for Health 
Statistics for other purposes (Gittelsohn, 
1982; Hanis, 1980), but not for verifying the 
accuracy of the coding of Asian American 
deaths. Given the expertise available at the 
National Center for Health Statistics, it 
should not be difficult for the agency to col- 
laborate on such a methodological study with 
an advisory committee which includes Asian 
American researchers. 

Third, in the next decade when the U.S. Stan- 
dard Death Certificate will again be revised, 
serious thought should be given to allowing 
a separate identification of Asian Indians, 
Koreans, Vietnamese, Cambodians, and 
Laotians in the State vital registration forms. 
These immigrants have arrived in large num- 
bers as a result of the Immigration Act of 
1965. Within two decades, they have grown 
in size to come close to the number of 
Chinese and Japanese who arrived over a 
100-year span. The explicit identification of 
these ethnic groups in vital registrations will 
provide future investigators with a rich 
source of data on Asian American mortality 
patterns in general, and suicide in particular, 
at a relatively low cost. 

Additionally, a nation-wide suicide register 
can be established, with more detailed infor- 
mation about the decedent's demographic 
and socioeconomic background, including 
family history of suicide and other types of 
mental illness, occupation, and type of work. 
The information obtained from the death 
register will greatly augment the quantity and 
quality of the data on suicide that are 
presently only available from the use of death 
certificates. It will also be a useful tool for 
monitoring deaths due to suicide, both for re- 
search and for prevention purposes.

Report of Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



Special in-dcpth studies should be en- 
couraged through the grants and contracts 
mechanism, including requests-for- 
proposals and supplemental grants to exist- 
ing minority mental health research centers, 
by the Federal funding agencies such as the 
National Institute of Mental Health, the Na- 
tional Institute for Child Health and 
Development of the National Institutes for 
Health, and others. Such studies should 
specifically encourage the examination of 
ethnic differences in suicide, and within each 
group, the analysis of at least gender and 
nativity differences, if not other factors as 
well. From our work on the 1970 and 1980 
data, it is clear that even among the Chinese 
and the Japanese youth, the increase in 
suicide varies by gender and by nativity. A 
thorough understanding of the cultural 
values and social structural factors which 
contribute to suicide would be most helpful 
in guiding the work of counselling and 
prevention programs. In short, we need to 
go beyond the limits of epidemiologic 
methods and venture into sociological, 
psychological, and anthropological studies of 
suicide. The subject deserves to be studied 
using an interdisciplinary approach, rathier 
than just an epidemiologic one. By en- 
couraging young investigators to work close- 
ly with seasoned researchers in existing 
minority mental health research centers, the 
costs of research can be kept to a minimum 
and the collaboration of an interdisciplinary 
team of researchers assured. Proceedings of 
the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 
and other research findings on suicide that 
are forthcoming should be disseminated 
widely not only to research and prevention 
centers in the country, but also to school 
teachers and counselors alike. The latter 
come in close daily contact with the popula- 
tion most at risk of suicide. Their informed 
knowledge of the early signs of suicidal be- 
havior can go a long way towards the reduc- 
tion, if not prevention, of a major public 
health problem in the United States.

BLACK YOUTH SUICIDE: LITERATURE REVIEW WITH 
A FOCUS ON PREVENTION 

F.M. Baker, M.D., M.P.H., Psychiatrist/Epidemiologist, National Institute of Neurological and 
Communicative Diseases and Stroke, National Institutes of Healthy and Assistant Professor, 
Department of Psychiatry, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine 



ABSTRACT 

The national rates of completed suicide in 
the black population between 1950 and 1981 
are presented including age-adjusted rates. 
Specific studies of suicide attempts and com- 
pleted suicides by blacks in several cities, e.g., 
New York, Philadelphia, Newark, Rochester 
(New York), and New Haven, are discussed. 
Methodological problems with existing 
studies and national suicide statistics are 
presented. Proposed theories of black 
suicide are reviewed. Based upon a summary 
of the characteristics of black suicide at- 
tempters reported in the literature, specific 
primary, secondary, and tertiary preventive 
strategies are suggested. 

INTRODUCTION 

Data from the National Center for Health 
Statistics (NCHS) have documented the in- 
crease in suicides by black Americans. Bet- 
ween 1950 and 1981 the suicide rates for 
black Americans increased: 114 percent for 
black males in the 15-24 age group and 33 
percent for black females in the 15-24 age 
group (1). NCHS data also document the 
higher and increasing rates of suicide in white 
Americans (1). Other authors address this 
issue in another volume of the Report of the 
Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide (2). 
This author will focus only on black suicide 
attempters and completers in this paper. 



By the 1980 census (3) blacks comprised 12 
percent of the United States population with 
41 percent of the black population between 
ages 16-39, the ages of highest risk for suicide 
among blacks (4,5,6). The increase in suicide 
by both black and white youth have resulted 
in the National Institute of Mental Health'.s 
establishing suicide as one of its priority areas 
for 1986. 

But what specific information exists concern- 
ing the precipitating events, the psychosocial 
stressors, and interpersonal stressors that 
result in suicidal acts by black youth? Are 
there specific psychological theories which 
suggest etiology c mechanisms behind 
suicidal behavior in young Afro- Americans? 
To answer these questions and to identify 
specific primary, secondary, and tertiary 
preventive strategies, a literature review was 
conducted. The majority of the studies ot 
black suicide attempters were completed in 
response to the work of Hendin (7) and the 
Black Revolution of the 1960s. The studies 
varied from theoretical papers which sum- 
marized mortality data and attempted to 
hyjjothesize an etiology for the observed in- 
creased rates of black suicide, through com- 
parative studies of black and white suicide 
attempters in several cities. Only one case- 
control study was identified and only two 
studies conducted a longitudinal assessment 
of a population during a period of four or 



3-177

more years. Although the majority of these 
studies are descriptive and I have some con- 
cerns with the methodological designs, I will 
review the known information in order to 
identify specific areas on which research 
should focus, as well as suggest various levels 
of preventive strategies. 

UNITED STATES BLACK 
POPULATION IN 1980 

To understand the magnitude of suicidal be- 
havior within the black community, it is im- 
portant to review the demographic 
characteristics of Afro-Americans in the 
United States in 1980. The inaccuracies of 
the United States Census have been at- 
tributed to the failure of black persons to 
respond to the census as well as to the 
enumerators' fear of urban neighborhoods. 
Acknowledging these imperfections, specific 
data are presented to provide a context for 
our discussion. 

In 1980 (2) 12 percent of the United States 
population was black-26.5 million persons. 
Fifty-three percent of blacks were females 
and 47 percent were riales. Forty-four per- 
cent of black females were in the child-bear- 



ing years, between ages 15 and 44. The per- 
centage Afro-Americans in each age 
categoiy by sex is shown in Table 1. Forty- 
one percent of black males and 41 percent of 
black females are between ages 16 to 39. Al- 
though black males outnumber black females 
through age 19, the loss of black males begins 
in the 20 to 24 age group with a significant 
difference noted in the 40 to 49 age group. 
Causes of premature death in black males 
ages 16 to 39 include homicide, suicide, acci- 
dents, and substance abuse (8,9,10). In fact, 
homicide is the leading cause of death for 
black males of ages 15 to 44 (8) This sex dif- 
ference is sustained throughout the latter 
years of the life cycle. Approximately 30 per- 
cent of the black population is below the 
po- srty level compareid to 9.4 percent of the 
total population. Table 2 shows the percent- 
age of individuals below the poverty level by 
race and age group. The average number of 
peisons per black family is 3.7 and in white 
families, 3.9. In the black population 
1,568,417 households were headed by a 
female without a husband present, with their 
own children under age 18. For whites, 
3,166,397 households were headed by a 
female without a husband present, with their 
own children under age 18.

F.M.Baker: Black Youth Suicide 



NATIONAL STATISTICS ON 
COMPLETED SUICIDES 

In Health, United States, 1984 suicide rates 
were presented for blacks and whites by sex 
for the years 1950 through 1981 (11). Table 
3 presents the rates per 100,000 population 
for ten year age groups. Figures 1-8 (Figures 
appear at end of chapter.) present graphic 
comparisons of white and black suicides by 
sex for each ten-year age group. In this 31- 
year period, suicides in white males increased 
3.2 fold in the 15-24 age group and in the 25- 
34 year age groups they nearly doubled. In 
all age ranges white males continued to have 
a steady increase in completed suicide. 

The increase in suicide by black males was 
also documented by national statistics. From 
1950 to 1970, there was a 114 percent in- 
crease in the black male rate in the 15-24 age 
group and 106 percent increase in the 25-34 
age group. By 1981, the suicide rate for black 
males showed a 134 percent increase in the 
25-34 age group. During the thirty-one year 
period. 1950-1981, suicide declined sharply 
in black males beginning in the 35-44 age 
group and continued throughout the life 
cycle. 



The suicide rates for black females remained 
low in comparison to white females. Suicide 
rates in black females increased 111 percent 
for the 15-24 age group between 1950 and 
1970. By 1981, this rate had declined to 33 
percent gi eater than the 1950 rate. For black 
females, the 25-34 and 35-44 age groups had 
the highest suicide rates during the 1950 
through 1981 period with peak rates occur- 
ring in 1970, a 1 19 percent and 85 percent in- 
crease respectively. For this 31 year period, 
white female suicide rates p&aked in 1970 in 
the 25-54 age groups. By 1981, the suicide 
rate for white females in the 45-55 age group 
peaked, but only by 6 percent above the 1950 
rate. The rate for the 15-24 age group had 
increased 81 percent and for the 25-34 age 
group, 50 percent. 

The Afro-American population of the 
United States is a younger population with a 
broader based population pyramid. The 
white population is older with a population 
pyramid that is mcie evenly dL ^ributed in all 
age groupings. Age-adjustment is a method 
that corrects for these age differences in the 
population of each race. Table 4 presents 
the age-adjusted suicide rates for the years 
1950 to 1981. The age-adjusted rates (direct

method of adjustment using the 1940 United 
States population) show a 57 percent in- 
crease in completed suicide by black males, a 
4 percent increase in white males, a 47 per- 
cent increase in black females, and a 13 per- 
cent increase in white females. 

LITERATURE ON BLACK 
SUICIDE 

In 1938, Prudhomme (12,13) addressed the 
issue of suicide among blacks in the United 
States population during the pre- World War 
n period at a time of black migration and 
legalized segregation. He emphasized 
restricted economic opportunities, rural 
living, and group solidarity facilitated by 
racism as factors contributing to the lower 
rates of suicide in blacks. 

The Civil Rights movement began in 1954 
and evolved into the Black Revolution of the 
19605. Several major national leaders were 
assassinated in the late 1960$ including Dr. 
Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcohn X. In 
1969, Hendin (14) reported on his sample of 
25 black suicide attempters in New York who 
were identified through hospitalization. He 
emphasized the role of tenement living and 
concluded that black suicide was precipitated 
by the frustrations of ghetto life, discrimina- 
tion by whites, and aberrant black family pat- 
terns. In this psychoanalytic study Hendin 
discussed the attempters' families which 



were characterized by absent, physically 
violent fathers and mothers who were brutal 
or left their children in the hands of others 
who were brutal to them. Self-hatred and in- 
tense rage characterized these suicide at- 
tempters, particularly the black males. 

In 1978, Hendin (15) described the mixture 
of despair and violence that characterized 
the struggle of ghetto-residing black suxide 
attempters who represented the poorest 
socioeconomic group among the black 
population. Hendin looked at a sample of 
black college students who were part of a 
sample of black suicide attempters that he 
studied for five years. He found that al- 
though they lived with their parents, they 
were involved in a link of "emotional dead- 
ness" which bound them to their parents. 
These students were absorbed and preoc- 
cupied with their own ectinction as an ongo- 
ing part of their adaptation and used work 
(dull, demanding mental labor) "as a way of 
maintaining a distanced, uninvolved «tate to 
conceal that they had no right to live." (16) 

The high rates of homicide among black 
males and the increasing rates of suicide 
noted through the 1970s stimulated many 
comments and studies in the literature which 
attempted to explain these rates in the con- 
text of the Black revolution. Wolfgang (17) 
reviewed Philadelphia police records and 
concluded that there was a disproportionate-

ly high number of "victim-precipitated" 
homicides in "which the victims have acted in 
such way as to bring about their deaths at the 
hands of others, often by being the first to use 
or threaten physical violence." 

In 1970, Seiden (18) reviewed the stresses on 
young, urban, black men: 1) excessive and 
consistent unemployment, 2) the resulting 
incapability to be useful to others and com- 
petent to make their own way, and 3) the 
potential for an increase in suicides as job op- 
portunities open up in a period of rapid, 
forced, and unequal change (resulting from 
the impact of the Black Revolution upon 
society). Seiden suggested that the expecta- 
tions and hopes created more rapidly than 
they could be fulfilled, resulted in intensified 
frustrations and despair. 

Bagley and Greer (19) criticized the 1969 
work of Seiden for its small sample size, the 
absence of controls, and commented that if 
patterns of suicide in blacks reflected black 
alienation, then black suicide rates in New 
York City should be higher than white rates 
for all ages. Although these authors iden- 
tified 25 "black" suicide attempters firom a 
medically treated, emergency room (ER) 
sample, their study was not comparable to 
any other studies completed in the United 
States. In addition to reporting a sample 
which mixed two cases of completed suicide 
with 23 cases of attempted suicide, these 
authors had a broad definition of "black" 
(economically disadvantaged and oppressed) 
and included Africans, Caribbean, Indians, 
Pakistanis, and persons from Cyprus in their 
"black" sample. All were recent immigrants 
to England. Although they used a control 
group of white suicide attempters matched 
for age, sex, and marital status, the ap- 
plicability of their data to a black United 
States sample is questionable. Bagley and 
Greer found that 48 percent of "black" 
suicide attemp' its compared to 12 percent of 
white suicide attempters were diagnosed as 
an acute situational reaction. Only 8 percent 
of "black" cases compared to 24 percent of 
white controls had brain damage or were 
psychotic. Although none of the "black" 



suicide attempters were diagnosed as 
sociopaths or addicted to drugs, 12 percent 
of white controls were. "Black" suicide at- 
tempters in this sample were younger than 
the white controls. 

In 1973, Pederson, Awad, and Kindler (2) 
reported a sample of suicide attempters iden- 
tified from the Monroe County Psychiatric 
Case Register. The Case Register recorded 
all psychiatric contacts including ER visits, 
public and private psychiatric hospitaliza- 
tions, and visits to private psychiatrists. From 
1964 through 1967, 1345 persons were seen 
as the result of a suicide attempt, an average 
of 336 suicide attempts per year representing 
0.8 percent of all ER visits. Nonwhite 
(predominately black) and white attempters 
were compared. 

Nonwhite attempters were younger; 47 per- 
cent of nonwhite attempters were of ages 15- 
24 compared to 36 percent of the white 
suicidf attempters. In all age cohorts for this 
19605 sample, the attempt rates for nonwhite 
females were higher than those of nonwhite 
males by an average of 4-5 percent When 
nonwhite females were compared with white 
temales, only in the 45 and older age group- 
ings were the percentage of nonwhite at- 
tempts less (5%) than the white attempts 
(15%). The majority (84%) of nonwhite 
suicide attempters were in the lowest 
socioeconomic group. In this sample of 
suicide attempters, 67 percer*" of wnite 
females and 78 percent of white males had 
some prior psychiatric contact (not 
specifieid). This contrasted with 49 percent 
of nonwhite females and 50 percent of non- 
white males having some prior psychiatric 
contact (not specified). When marital status 
was assessed, 28 percent of nonwhite females 
were separated compared to 9 percent ot 
white females. Fifty-four percent of the non- 
white males were single, significantly greater 
than any other group. 

When the diagnoses of this Rochester, New 
York, sample of suicide attempters were 
reviewed, 25 percent of white male at- 
tempters and 13 percent of white female at- 
tempters were diagnosed as psychotic in 



3-182 



FMBaker: Black Youth Suicide 



contrast to only 10 percent of nonwhite male 
and female attempters. Thirty-six percent of 
nonwhite male atlempters in comparison to 
all other groups were diagnosed as having a 
neurosis. In this sample, the ratio of non- 
white male to nonwhite female attempters 
was 1:6 in contrast to a ratio of 1:3 among 
white suicide attempters. Only in this study 
were suicide attempters followed lon- 
gitudinally /rom 1964 through 1968. Thirty- 
five attempters completed suicide by 1968; 31 
were white and 4 were nonwhite. Of the 
white suicide attempters who completed 
suicide, 16 were male and IS were female. In 
the nonwhite sample, 1 male and 3 female 
suicide attempters completed suicide. The 
white suicide rate for Monroe County 
(Rochester, New York) was calculated as 
10.51 per 100,000 and for nonwhite as 8.98 
per 100,000 per year. 

In 1974, a case-control study of suicide at- 
tempters was published by Stein, Levy, and 
Glasberg (21). White and black suicide at- 
tempters were identified from psychiatric ad- 
missions to a large municipal hospital in New 
York City. White and black controls were 
matched for age (within 3 years), race, and 
the time of admission nearest to that of the 
suicide attempters. The controls were hospi- 
talized, psychiatric patients who denied 
suicidal ideation and had no recent or past 
suicide attempts. The authors focused on the 
role of a history of separation from close 
figures in the individual's life as a risk factor 
for attempting suicide. They defined 
childhood separation as "a physical separa- 
tion from a parent, parent surrogate, or sib- 
ling, of six months duration occurring from 
birth to 17 years of age." Early childhood 
separation was defined as a separation occur- 
ring from birth to 7 years of age. The 48 white 
female suicide attempters and controls, the 
49 white male suicide attempters and con- 
trols, the 48 black female suicide attempters 
and controls, and the 20 black male suicide 
attempters and controls comprised the total 
sample of 330. Black male and female iuicide 
attemptei. in this study were younger than 
white suicide attempters; the mean age for 
males was 24.1 and for female, 25.6. Using 



education as an index of social class, all 
suicide attempters and controls in this study 
were of the same, lower social class. The 
authors found that only white male and white 
female suicide attempters had a greater num- 
ber of childhood and antecedent separations 
than controls. Black male and black female 
suicide attempters had significantly more 
(p<.100) rarly childhood separations com- 
pared to black controls. In this sample, black 
female suicide attempters had significantly 
more (p<.001) separations between 7-17 
years of age than the controls. Further, a his- 
tory of antecedent separations was highest 
among white female suicide attempters fol- 
lowed by black female and black male suicide 
attempters, and, lastly, white male suicide at- 
tempters. When interaction between an- 
tecedent and childhood separation and 
suicide attempt was assessed, this study found 
no significant interaction. These authors 
suggested that the interaction between 
suicide attempts and antecedent and 
childhood separations may involve a variety 
of factors including type of separation ex- 
periv/nces prior to and following separation, 
and t ae effiect of threatened or psychological 
separations. FinaUy, the authors questioned 
whether childhood separation predisposed 
to maladaptive responses to separaliom in 
the adult The role of the extended family 
(22) and the "adoption" mechanism of black 
families (23) v^ere not addressed. 

Monk and Warshauer (24) compared com- 
pleted and attempted suicides in three ethnic 
groups in New York City for the years 1968 
through 1970 for completed suicides and 
June 1971 through June 1972 for attempted 
suicides evaluated by the hospitals serving 
the target popula^'ons in East Harlem. 
Ninety-six suicides were completed between 
1968 and 1970 and 359 suicide attempters 
were evaluated between 1971 and 1972. 

When age-adjusted suicide rates were com- 
piled for New York City fnr the 1960-1961 
period, black males had a higher rate, 20.7 
per 100,000 for persons age 15 and over, 
compared to a white late of 17.1 per 100,000 
for persons age 15 and over. Similar figures 



197

Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



for the period of 19674968 found a black, 
age-adjusted rate of 16.8 and a white age-ad- 
justed rate of 18.5. The authors suggested 
that part of the difference in white and black 
suicide rates reported elsewhere could 
reflect differential reporting in the classiHca- 
tion of deaths for the two groups. 

Specific proHems with suicide statistics were 
discussed by Warshauer and Monk in 1978 
(25) i;i a subsequent paper based on this 
study. Data on deaths from four New York 
City Health Districts with a significant ethnic 
minority population were compared with the 
records of the Office of the Chief Medical ex- 
aminer. Reports of suicidal deaths were 
received by the Health Department from the 
Office of the Chief Medical Examiner and 
were classified according to the Internation- 
al Classiflcation of Disease (ICD) codes. 
The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of 
New York City divided deaths into definite 
suicides and assigned suicides (deaths which 
could not be signed out as suicide) and deaths 
shown to be suicide upon investigation, but 
which were not signed out as such because no 
final determination was requested. As the 
unconfirmed black suicides in this sample 
used unusual methods twice as often as 
whites, blacks were classified as assigned 
suicides and did not appear in the Health 
Department statistics which were forwarded 
to the National Center for Health Statistics. 
Because of incomplete histories and less fre- 
quently used methods such as jumping, all 
black suicides were not classified in the 
dtefinite suicide categoiy. A further factor in- 
viuidating the New York City suicide fiigures 
was the impact of the change in the ICD 
coc'ing which resulted in the failure to code 
' deaths which had been classified as suicide 
before the cha:ige in ICD coding. The 
change differentially affected black suicides. 
Thus, these authors demonstrated how the 
statistics on completed suicides by blacks 
could be underreported, locally and nation- 
ally. As assigned suicides may not be Oiially 
categorized until the toxicology report was 
returned, these cases would be delayed and 
the correct figures would not be reported to 
the Health Department. The extent to which 



erIc "-'^ 



these problems exist in other municipalities 
across the nation is unclear. 

Lester and Beck (26) reported a sample of 
124 white and 115 black suicide attempters 
admitted to a metropolitan Philadelphia 
hospital. Only subjects ages 40 and younger 
were included for comparison with the prior 
work of Hendin. Each suicide attempter was 
seen within 48 hours of admission by an ex- 
perienced clinician to obtain a history, clini- 
cal evaluation, and to review the patient's 
state of mind. In a second interview a 
psychological technician obtained a detailed 
psychosocial history and administered the 
Beck Depression Inventory and the General - 
ized Expectancies Scale. When white and 
black suicide attempters were compared, five 
significant differences were identified from 
the 54 tests: black males were more likely to 
be Protestant, less likely to be living with 
others, more often had been separated from 
their fathers, scored lower on a test of 
vocabulary, and (if diagnosed as 
schizophrenic) were more likely to be diag- 
nosed as paranoid. When white and black 
female suicide attempters were compared, 
significant differences were identified in 12 
tests: black females had not completed as 
many grades, had more unofficial marital ar- 
rangements (cohabitation and separation 
versus marriage and divorce), had worse 
physical health, used more alcohol, had made 
fewer previous suicide attempts, were more 
often Protestant, lived more often in a low 
rent district, had experienced more separa- 
tions from their fathers, and (/f separated 
from their mothers) had experienced the 
separation at an earlier age. Black femab at- 
tempters had poorer vocabulary scores, 
lower suicidal intent scores, and (if diagnosed 
as schizophrenic) were more likely to be diag- 
nosed as paranoid. When black male and 
black female attempters were compared, 
black females were more often living with 
others, more often unemployed, more likely 
to attempt suicide at home, and were less 
psychiatrically disturbed. The authors noted 
that the Iovjgt educational level of blacks, the 
differences in religious affiliation, and the 
high incidence of absent fathers among black

suicide attempters was probably reflective of 
socioeconomic status. Lester Black con- 
cluded that they did not find evidence of 
black self-hatred and rage in the psychologi- 
cal measures that were used in their Philadel- 
phia sample. The authors summarized their 
results as showing more similarities between 
black and white suicide attempters than dif- 
ferences. 

In 1976, Kiev and Anumonye compared 
blacksuicide attempters in Newark, New Jer- 
sey with a sample of white suicide attempters 
in New York City (27). They reported a male 
to female ratio of 1:1, higher than ratios 
reported by studies in other settings. Al- 
though these authors commented about sig- 
nificant alcohol abuse by black suicide 
attempters in their sample, this was not quan- 
tified. 

In 1977, Steele reported a sample of 275 
suicide attempters who were identified from 
the ER of a general hospital in New Haven, 
Connecticut (28). Twenty-two percent 
(N=62) of these suicide attempters were 
black. Overall, this author found few dif- 
ferences between black and white attempters 
on 42 variables assessing mood, motivation, 
etc. Although white suicide attempters ap- 
peared to be more motivated to influence 
others by their suicide attemp\ were more 
depressed, and tended to show more 
deliberation in their suicide attempts, the 
clinical signiflcance of these statistical dif- 
ferences was questioned. Although white 
suicide attempters were found to be more 
deliberate in their attempts than black at- 
tempters, both groups were impulsive and 
the majority of both groups deliberated 
about their suicide attempt for onSy an hour 
or less. In view of these findings, Steele ques- 
tioned whether a separate psychology was 
needed for black suicide attempters and 
stressed the need to review the belief in men- 
tal health circles that blacks were less likely 
to engage in suicidal behavior. 

Baker (29) conducted a descriptive study of 
black iuicide attempters evaluated in an ER 
setting in a Ncv Haven general hospital 
which she contrasted with prior studies in this 



setting. Her 1980 sample of 56 black suicide 
attempters was compared with prior studies 
of suicide attempters in this setting by Steele, 
(28), Weissmao, Pakal, and French (30), 
Weissman (31), and Fox and Weissman (32). 

Previous studies in this ER setting described 
a population of suicide attempters who were 
predominantly white, single females who im- 
pulsively took an overdose in the context of 
an argument with a significant other. Al- 
though diagnoses were not reported in 
Weissman's three studies, the attempters 
studied had no prior psychiatric history. In 
1980, blacks comprised 18 percent of the 
total suicide attempter population of 315. 
The 1980 sample of black suicide attempters 
was significantly different from those of pre- 
vious studies. Sixty-four percent of the black 
female attempters had a prior psychiatric his- 
tory; 54 percent had made a previous suicide 
attempt or gesture. Their primary diagnoses 
were 33 percent with affective illness and 31 
percent with adjustment disorders with 
depressive features. Only 20 percent of 
black females had used alcohol prior to their 
attempt. In the 1980 New Haven sample, 
black male suicide attempters were marked- 
ly different from prior studies in this setting. 
Seventy-six percent had a previous 
psychiatric history, 35 percent had made a 
previous suicidal gesture or attempt, and 59 
percent were diagnosed as psychotic (bipolar 
or schizophrenic). Twenty- nine percent of 
the back male suicide attempters had Ui>ed al- 
cohol prior to their attempt. 

The primaiy method of attempt by the black 
suicide attemp'.ers in the 1980 study was drug 
overdose: 74 percent in black females and 71 
percent in black males. The agents used had 
changed to include not only sedative-hyp- 
notic medications (methaqualone) and anti- 
anxiety agents (diazepam and 
chlordiazepoxide), but also over-the-counter 
medications (Sominex, Mydal, Nytol, 
Humphrey's 11), and prescription medica- 
tion (insulin, penicillin G procaine, 
furosemide). All attempters were in Hol- 
lingshead-Redlich social class IV and V, the 
lowest socioeconomic groupings. The male

to female ratio in this sample was 1:2.3. 

In contrast to other studies of suicide at- 
tempters, Baker focused on the person who 
accompanied the attempter or came later to 
the ER. Sixty-four percent of black female 
and 35 percent of black male attempters were 
accompanied to the ER by a family member, 
usually the mother, a sibling or spouse, or 
children in declining order of frequency. In 
each case, the accompanying signiflcant 
other was involved in or was aware of the 
psychosocial stressors that precipitated the 
suicidal act. Of the 31 patients referred to 
outpatient treatment, 22 percent entered 
treatment, 10 percent made one appoint- 
ment and dropped out, and 55 percent did 
not followup on their referral. In a 1968 
sample of New Haven suicide attempters, 
Paykel, Hallowell, and Dressier (33) 
reported that of 38 percent of their sample 
of white and nonwhite attempters who were 
referred for outpatient treatment, only 16 
percent showed up for their appointment. 
Baker suggested that greater focus on couple 
or family crisis intervention in the ER with 
the attempter and the accompanying per- 
son(s) could have two important benefits. 
First, it could identify outpatient psychiatric 
resources that could be used for future con- 
flict resolution so that the person would not 
have to attempt suicide to communicate dis- 
tress. Second, involvement of the significant 
other(s) at the time of initial ER or crisis cen- 
ter contact could facilitate the entry of the at- 
tempter into outpatient treatment 

THEORIES OF BLACK SUICIDE 

Before turning to a discussion of preventive 
strategies, let us review the various theories 
developed to explain black suicide. In 1897, 
(34) Durkheim discussed the sociological 
dimensions of suicide. He related the rising 
suicide rate in the civilized world to a func- 
tional failure of State, church, and com- 
munity as the forces for social integration 
that they had been prior to the Industrial 
Revolution. Durkheim saw vulnerability to 
suicide as existing in people who were not in- 
tegrated into any religious, communal, or 



family group. Even more vulnerable were in- 
dividuals who suffered a disturbance in the 
balance of their social integration: the single, 
widowed, and divorced having higher suicide 
rates than the married. 

Hendin (15) pointed out that Durkheim's 
theory did not explain the high rates of 
suicide in Austria, a Catholic country. Nor 
did it explain the strikingly high suicide rates 
in Denmark and Sweden compared to the 
low suicide rate in Norway. He emphasized 
the need for a psychosocial approach to un- 
derstanding the differences in suicidal be- 
havior across cultures. Hendin stated that 
the Freudian construct (35) which sees 
suicide as a response to loss or abandonment 
of a loved object as insufficient in itself. 
Psychodynamically, rebirth, return, or 
reunion fantasies with the lost object may be 
seen as an attempt to undo or deny loss. 
Freud's instinctual frame of reference did not 
lead him to be concerned with the 
psychological impact of the social institutions 
of particular cultures or with psychosocial 
questions such as why suicide was very high 
in one country and low in another. Hendin 
suggested that more than an amalgam of 
Freud and Durkheim was needed to under- 
stand the varying motivations for suicide in 
diR'erent cultures and subcultures, the dif- 
ferences between genders and different age 
groups, and differences in ways of coping 
with love and loss, life, and death. 

More recent theories address the current 
context of black suicide attempters. Specific 
explanations of black suicide include: 1) 
urban stress, 2) the status-integration theory, 
3) the black family deficit theory, and the 4) 
external restraint theory. The urban stress 
(frustration-aggression) hypothesis (Seiden, 
16) proposes that compounded urban stres- 
ses associated with migration, poverty, un- 
employment, racism, poor housing, and poor 
education result in violence which often, 
though not always, takes the form of suicide. 
The status-integration theory suggests that as 
blacks work their way into the middle and 
upper-middle classes they inherit the 
economic, social, and psychological tensions 



3-186

of their white counterparts. Davis (36) sug- 
gests that the more upwardly mobile blaclcs 
are, the more intense are the problems of ad- 
justment and assimilation into the American 
mainstream. These tensions produce a cor- 
roding sense of internal alienation which may 
result in self-destruction. The absence of 
higher suicide rates in black females provides 
some evidence against this theory. But, the 
greater probability of private care for this 
population may prevent its identiHcation 
from ER statistics. A further bias involving 
completed suicide in middle-class black per- 
sons may be a collusion to prevent a diagnosis 
of suicide by the medical examiners office. 
These are methodological concerns in all 
studies of suicide attempters. 

The black family deficit theory presents the 
black family as being unable to meet the fun- 
damental needs of its members for survival, 
socialization, and the transmission of a viable 
cultural heritage. Pinderhughes (37), in dis- 
cussing the impact of poverty and racism on 
black families, described the result as the 'Vic- 
tim system." The work of Lewis and Looney 
(38) illustrated that working-class black 
families, just above the poverty level, were 
well-functioning uni^s. These authors sug- 
gest that sufficient economic insecurity can 
destablize and then perpetuate dysfunction- 
al patterns of family function. 

The external restraint theory of Henry and 
Short (39) suggested that suicide varied in- 
versely with horizontal restraining factors 
(social relationships with others) and vertical 
restraining factors (social class and/or social 
status). These authors and Maris (40) sug- 
gested that the strength of the relational sys- 
tem of the individual defined by marital 
status, urban-rural residence, and ecological 
distribution serve as buffers; the stronger the 
relational system, the lower the number of 
suicides. Davis (36) '/iewed this external 
restraint theory as more relevant to black 
suicide. He questioned whether the 
decrease in overt racism and discrimination, 
which in the past had fostered group 
solidarity, as noted by Prudhomme (12,13), 
would decrease the strength of the relation- 



al system for young black persons in the 
1980s. If this did occur, family ties would be 
left as the major insulation against the 
psychosocial stressors of daily living for the 
urban resident black youth. By this theory, if 
the family was disorganized, over-stressed, 
and/or dysfuncitonal, the black youth would 
have no ameliorating or buffering factors and 
would become a higher risk for suicidal be- 
havior. 

SUMMARY OF THE 
LITERATURE 

This review of the literature on black suicide 
has shown some divergent results across a 
variety of studies in several different cities. 
Several points of consensus as well as specific 
points of intervention follow. 

1. Black suicide rates peak for both sexes be- 
tween ages 25 and 44. 

2. Black suicide rates decline in both sexes 
after age 45. 

3. Black males have a "double risk of death" 
due to their high rates of death from 
homicide and suicide. 

4. Rates of completed suicide have remained 
consistently low in black females in com- 
parison to all other groups. 

5. During a 31 year period the increase in the 
race-sex specific rates of completed suicide 
have been highest among black males (57% 
increase) and in black females (47% in- 
crease) in age-adjusted national statistics. 

6. In specific States in specific years, suicide 
rates f&i black males exceed those for white 
males and white females in contrast to the 
overall national statistics. 

7. Evidence of municipal and regional dif- 
ferences in the rates of black suicide attempts 
and completed suicides is provided by the Los 
Angeles data of Christian (41) and the data 
of Pederson et all. (20) from Rochester 
(NY), the only studies which reported higher 
rates of suicide attempts in black females 
compared with white females.

8. The accuracy of national suicide statistics 
may be flawed if black suicides are not coded 
as suicide due to administrative procedures, 
the use of alternative methods of suicide, and 
delayed reporting due to pending laboratory 
studies. 

9. Only theories of suicide which have em- 
phasized interpersonal conflicts, familiar dis- 
cord, financial concerns, and the impact of 
poverty and racism upon the individual and 
the family, have stood the test of time and 
repeated observations in suggesting specific 
etiologies of suicide attempts and completed 
suicide by Afiro-Americans. 

10. Initiating crisis intervention techniques 
which include the person who accompanies 
the suicide attempter to the ER or crisis set- 
ting may: a) improve foUowup on referral to 
outpatient treatment and b) prevent future 
suicide attempts by making everyone in the 
attempter's network more sensitive to the 
cues of distress in the system and aware of the 
resources to use to seek help. 

11. Although the literature suggests that 
suicide attempters and persons who com- 
plete suicide are different populations, there 
have been no published studies to date that 
have contrasted black suicide attempters and 
blocks who completed sui ide in the same 
geographically defined area in the same 
defined time period. 

12. The population of black suicide at- 
tempters evaluated in some ERs in 1980 ap- 
pears to be changing: an increased 
proportion of attempters, have a history of 
psychiatric treatment and a greater severity 
of psychiatric diagnoses. 

PREVENTIVE STRATEGIES 

Three levels of prevention are discussed in 
textbooks (42). Primary prevention involves 
actions which prevent disease as exemplified 
by vaccination. Secondary prevention 
focuses on the treatment of illness, e.g. 
hospitalization of a psychotically disor- 
ganized individual. Tertiary prevention 
focuses on the rehabilitation of an individual 



to facilitate return to productive function, 
e.g. postventive work with the surviving fami- 
ly members of a person who has completed 
suicide. 

Primary preventive strategies involving black 
suicidal youth should focus upon conflict 
resolution in the family and the clarification 
of expectations in various relationships. 
Helping black adolescents and youth to un- 
derstand the factors that they can control and 
the factors which are controlled by society 
may aid in clarifying the sources of frustration 
in the 1980s. As noted by Davis (43), high 
"in-group" stress may result from an 
individual's family relationships, friendships, 
and personal relationships. The "extra 
group" stresses resulting from work relation- 
ships with other people and financial difficul- 
ties may be modified by support from the 
extended family and community groups such 
as churches or social clubs. Aiding black 
youth in sorting out the locus of stress and 
identifying effective action, should prevent a 
build-up of frustration to the point of impul- 
sive action. These educational activities 
could be centered in schools, churches, and 
adolescent drop-in centers and could be 
sponsored by black church groups, black 
businesses, and black fraternal organizations. 

Although New Haven represents only one 
study site, the population of suicide at- 
tempters has been studied over a 32-year 
period. With deinstitutionalization and the 
increased utilization of community mental 
health centers and general hospitals for in- 
patient psychiatric treatment, the population 
of psychiatric patients coming to the general 
hospital ER has included an increasing 
proportion of patients with prior psychiatric 
histories. Patients with affective illness 
(Tsuang, 44, Tsuang and Woolson, 45), 
schizophrenia (Roy, 46, Brier and Astrachan, 
47), and substance abuse-particulariy al- 
cohol (Motto, 48, Murphy, Armstrong, ond 
Hermele, 49) are at increased risk for at- 
tempting suicide. Informational prc^ams 
organized for the families of patients with 
psychiatric illness are important primary 
preventive strategies. Improving the family's 



3-188 



2r-2 



FMBaker: Black Youth Suicide 



knowledge of symptoms and behavioral 
changes characteristic of psychotic decom- 
pensation will enable the family to seek help 
before a frank psychotic episode occurs. The 
distressed and distraught youth can be 
brought to a crisis intervention setting for 
help before a suicide attempt signals that 
something is wrong. 

Another primary preventive strategy invol- 
ves the removal of all out-of-date and un- 
necessary medication from the home. As 
overdose remains a major method of suicide 
attempt for some black populations, remov- 
ing medications from the home would 
decrease the availability of medications to a 
distraught individual making an impulsive 
act. Prescribing non-lethal amounts of 
medication to patients in active psychiatric 
treatment who have diagnoses associated 
with an increased risk of suicide would be 
helpful, also. 

Secondary preventive strategies should focus 
upon the initial evaluation of the black 
suicide attempter, whether in the ER of a 
general hospital or the crisis unit of a com- 
munity mental health center. As noted by 
Baker (29), the person who accompanies the 
suicide attempter or co/nes later to the ER is 
usually aware of and involved in the events 
which precipitated the suicidal act. By in- 
itiating family and/or couple crisis interven- 
tion at the time of initial evaluation, conflict 
resolution can be facilitated and the pos- 
sibility of followup and entry into treatment 
can be improved. Further, the suicide at- 
tempter and his/her family can be provided 
with alternatives for help at a time of future 
crisis to prevent future suicide attempts 
through de-escalation of crises by the family 
seeking help and services at a crisis facility. 
Initially, the presistantly suicidal patient who 
presents repeatedly with suicidal gestures/at- 
tempts and does not follow through on refer- 
rals to treatment should be involuntarily 
hospitalized. Involuntary psychiatric 
hospitalization is recommended in order to 
break the cycle and initiate the treatment 
process. 

Tertiary preventive strategies have focused 



on the surviving significant others of the at- 
tempter. Fortunately the literature in this 
area is increasing (50,51,52). 

FUTURE RESEARCH 
DIRECTIONS 

As described in the above literature review, 
various studies have looked at suicide at- 
tempters and at those who complete suicide, 
sometimes in the same study. Only one case- 
control study compared black and white 
suicide attempters and childhood separation 
and only one study looked at the precipitat- 
ing events as well as the persons who accom- 
panied the attempter to the hospital. In 
order to detect the possibility of changing 
patterns in black suicide attempters which 
are indicated by increased psychiatric history, 
increased severity of psychiatric diagnoses, 
and the presence of psychosocial stressors 
such as those existing in the 1980s, more care- 
fully designed studies are needed. 

Although studies of black suicide attempters 
and completers have been conducted in New 
York City, Rochester (NY), Los Angeles, 
Detroit, Philadelphia, and New Haven, they 
were conducted in dJI?* rent years, they as- 
sessed diflerent pop.'Ia aons of suicide at- 
tempters, and emphasized the collection of 
different data. I suggest that the research ef- 
forts include a multi-site, prospective, 
descriptive study of black suicide attempters 
in dX least five cities with large black popula- 
tions, to be completed in the same calendar 
year, with a sample selected by the same 
method in each site. The research protocol 
should collect data on: demographics, 
method of attempt, priorhistoryofsuicideat- 
tempt, history of prior ER contacts, history 
of prior psychiatric treatment, specific 
precipitating events, evidence of substance 
use, the person who accompanied the suicide 
attempter to the crisis setting, information 
about self-perception, family constellation, 
and the network of interpersonal and social 
relationships-particularly those changing or 
stressed in the period before the attempt 
From this established data base, similarities 
and differences across the nation could be

identified. Subsequently, case-control 
studies using the identified sample of suicide 
attempters in the five cities could define 
specific risk factors and determine whether 
these risk factors varied in the five cities. 
Completed suicides in the same five cities 
could be reviewed for the same study period. 
Psychological autopsies as well as proxy in- 
terviews of the surviving next-of-kin to assess 
the precipitating events, current relation- 
ships, and self-image of the black persons 
who completed a suicide woud aid in clarify- 
ing the specific differences between the at- 
tempter and completer suicide populations. 
Where possible, an attempt should be made 
to identify suicide attempters ^nd completers 
in all socioeconomic classes. 

CONCLUSION 

Specificstrategies which can be implemented 
at the local/community level by societal in- 
stitutions and through federal research initia- 
tives have been suggested to address the 
national problem of black suicide. The im- 
plementation of these strategies has the 
potential to save lives and provide important 
data from which to develop future, more 
specific, preventive strategies.

SUMMARY 

Little is known about suicide among 
Hispanic Americans. We studied suicides 
among Hispanics of Mexican origin 
(Mexican Americans) in five southwestern 
States (Arizona, California, Colorado, New 
Mexico, and Texas) where more than 60 per- 
cent of all Hispanics in the United States 
reside (86% of whom are Mexican 
American). We obtained data on the num- 
ber of suicide deaths in the white population 
with Hispanics and Anglos (white, non- 
Hispanic) identified separately. Suicides of 
Anglos were used as a comparison group. 
The suicide rate for whites in the five south- 
western States was almost one-fourth higher 
than the rate for whites nationally. Suicide 
rates for the two ethnic groups, however, 
showed the rate for Hispanics to be less than 
the national rate for whites and one-half that 
of Anglos residing in the same area. The 
lower suicide rate for Hispanics relative to 
Anglos is seen for both males and females. 
The ratio of male to female suicides for 
Hispanics was greater than for Anglos (4.3 to 
1 for Hispanics and 2.7 to 1 for Anglos). 
Proportionately more suicides occur among 
young Hispanics than among young Anglos. 



More than one-third (34.6%) of Hispanic 
suicides occuned to persons less than 25 
years of age compared to one-sixth (16.5%) 
of Anglo suicides. The 1990 health objective 
for the United States for suicide identifies 
young persons 15 to 24 years of age as the 
population on whom to focus national 
suicide prevention and intervention efforts. 
This objective is appropriate for the Hispanic 
population since, from our findings, the 
highest suicide rates for Hispanics are in the 
20-24 year age group (17.1%). 

INTRODUCTION 

In 1978, suicide was the ninth leading cause 
of death for the white population in the 
United States with a rate of 13.4 deaths per 
100,000 population (1). Although much 
suicide data for whites have been collected, 
analyzed, and reported in official publica- 
tions and scientific literature (2,3,4), very few 
studies have examined suicides specifically 
among Hispanics, the largest ethnic sub- 
group within the white population (5,6,7,8). 
Furthermore, no study has compiled a large 
data set to analyze and compare suicide 



3-196 



210 



among Hispanics of Mexican origin with 
Anglos (white, non-Hispanics) living in the 
same geographic area. 

This paper updates data from a previously 
reported study (9) of suicide among Anglos 
and Hispanics in five southwestern States 
where more than 60 percent of the nation's 
Hispanics reside. 

METHODS 

The Hispanic population of the United 
States is composed of three major and cul- 
turally diverse subgroups: Mexican 
Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans. We 
studied the incidence of Hispanic suicide in 
the largest of these subgroups, Mexican 
Americans. 

Death certificates in each of the five south- 
western States (Arizona, California, 
Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas) allow for 
identification of Anglos and Hispanics 
separately; 86 percent of Hispanics in the 
five-State area are Mexican American (10). 
However, the States vary in the amount of 
mortality data they produce and publish on 
racial and ethnic groups in their annual vital 
statistics summaries. No State published 
suicide data for Anglos and Hispanics by the 
variables used in our study, namely, age, sex, 
and method of suicide. 

The Office of Vital Statistics of the respec- 
tive State health departments cooperated in 
this study by providing the Centers for Dis- 
ease Control (CDC) with either special 
tabulations or computer data tapes for all 
suicides of Anglos and Hispanics between 
1977 through 1980. Qassification of suicide 
as the cause of death was based on the Eighth 
Revision of the International Gassification 
of Disease Adapted (ICDA-8) for 1977-1978 
(1 1), and based on the Ninth Revision (ICD- 
9) for 1979-1982 (12). The titles for the 
cause-of-death category for suicide are iden- 
tical under the Eighth and Ninth Revisions 
and the comparability ratio between the two 
revisions is near 1.0 (13). The classification 
of suicide by method was based on cause of 
death codes E950-E959 in the International 



Gassification of Disease (11,12). 

We produced population data for cf ilculating 
suicide rates for Anglos and Hispanics in the 
five southwestern States by using computer 
tapes from the Current Population Surv^ 
(Q^S) (14). The population ^;atistics from 
CPS were estimates baseU cu a weighted na- 
tional sample. This sample was considered 
too small to provide reliable population es- 
timates at tLe State level by ethnicity, age, 
and sex. Therefore, suicide rates were 
centered for the selected time periods 1977- 
1979 anil 1980-1982 by using the mean num- 
ber of suicides for each 3-year period as the 
numerator and the mean population accord- 
ing to CPS data for each 3-year period, as the 
denominator. 

Hispanic ethnicity from State health depart- 
ment suicide data in general is determined by 
the name of the decedent appearing on the 
death certificate. That is, if the decedent's 
surname corresponds to a name on a list of 
Spanish surnames used by the State Office of 
Vital Statistics, then that person is 
categorized in the State mortality statistics as 
Hispanic. Hispanic in the Current Popula- 
tion Survey data is defined as a person of 
Hispanic origin who reported himselfi/herself 
as Mexican American, Chicano, Mexican, 
Puerto F ^an, Cuban, Central or South 
American, or other Spanish origin (IS). It is 
not possible to determine from State mor- 
tality data using Spanish surnames whether 
Hispanic suicide victims were Mexican 
American, Cuban, Puerto Rican, or of other 
Spanish origin. However, because popula- 
tion statistics (10) show that 86 percent of 
Hispanics in the five southwestern States are 
Mexican American, we may reasonably as- 
sume that the preponderance of Hispanics in 
our study who committed suicide were 
Mexican American. Less than 1 percent of 
persons in the five southwest&m States who 
were self-identified as Hispanic in the CPS 
surveys were nonwhite.* Our study Resumes 
that the number of persons of nonwhite races 
who were identified as Hispanics by having a 
Spanish surname is equally small. Anglo is 
defined as white, non-Hispanic.

RESULTS 

Hie suicide rate for whites in tine five south- 
western States was higher than the national 
suicide rateforwhites for both the i977-1979 
period and 1980-1982 period (TaSle 1). 
However, when we separated the suicide rate 
for whites in the five southwestern States into 
rates for Anglos and Hispanics, we see that 
the higher rate for whites for both time 
periods was a result of a high rate for Anglos- 
a rate that was approximately twice the rate 
for Hispanics. However, the difference be- 
tween the rates for Anglos and Hispanics 
narrowed slightly between the two time 
periods. For the period 1977-1979 the rate 
for Anglos was 2. 1 times higher than the rate 
for Hispanics compared with 2.0 times higher 
for ^he period 1980-1982. 

In both ethnic groups, more males than 
females committed suicide (Table 2). 
However, the ratio of male to female suicides 
was higher for Hispanics than Anglos. This 
higher sex ratio for Hispanics was c ^,nt 
for all age groups. 

Suicides occurred at younger ages among 
Hispanics than among Anglos. Table 2 
shows that 34.6 percent of all Hispanics who 



committed suicide v/ere under age 25 com- 
pared with 16.5 percent of Anglos who com- 
mitted suicide under age 25. More than half 
(52.1%) of Anglos who committed suicide 
were over age 40, while about one-fourth 
(26.2%) of Hispanics who committed suicide 
were over age 40. The data for males show 
an even more pronounced difference be- 
tween the age of suicide for Anglos and 
Hispanics. More than half (53.5%) of the 
Hispanic men who committed suicide were 
under age 30. On the other hand, less than 
one-third (30.9%) of Anglo men who com- 
mitted suicide were undei age 30. 

Three-year suicide rates for the period 1980- 
1982 show that the age-adjusted overall rate 
for Anglos is 1.7 times the rate for Hispanics 
(16.9 and 10.0, respectively) (Table 3). The 
age-adjusted suicide rate for Anglo men was 
more than one and a half times the suicide 
rate for Hispanic men (25.9 and 16.8, respec- 
tively), while the rate for Anglo women was 
more than fwice the rate for Hispanic women 
(8.9 and 3.6, respectively). Suicide rates for 
Anglos were higher than rates for Hispanics 
in evei;' age group, both male and female, 
with one exception-young Hispanic males 
(15-19 years of age) had a suicide rate slight-

J.CSmlth: Hispanic Suicide in the Southwest, 1980-1982 



Mi;thods of suicide are shown in Table 4. 
The primary method of suicide for Anglos 
and Hispanics was the same. More than half 
the persons in both ethnic groups who com- 
mitted suicide used firearms or explosives 
(59.8% of Anglos and 59.2% of Hispanics). 
Tho second and third most frequently used 
methods of suicides were reversed for the 
two ethnic groups. Poisoning (22.5%) was 
the second most frequently used method for 
Anglos, and hanging, strangulation, and suf- 
focation (10.8%) were the third most fre- 
quently used methods. The reverse was true 
for Hispanics (20.7% of suicides by hanging, 
strangulation, and suffocation and 12.8% of 
suicides by poisoning). 

The patterns of suicide by method were 
similar for females in both ethnic groups, 
namely, both Anglo and Hispanic females 
had equally high percentages of suicide by 
firearms and explosives (42.8% and 44.4%, 
respectively). Poisoning was the second 
most frequently used method for both Anglo 
and Hispanic females (41.5% and ^'^.5%, 
respectively) and hanging, strangulation, and 
suffocation was the third most frequently 
used method (7.9% and 13.5%, respectively). 
While Anglo and Hispanic males had equal- 



Table 4. 



Iv high percentages of suicide by firearms and 
explosives (66.0% and 62.6%, respectively), 
Anglo males had almost twice the percentage 
of poisoning (15.5% and 7.8% for Anglo and 
Hispanic males, respectively) and aUnost half 
the percentage of hanging, strangulation, 
and suffocation (11.9% and 22.3% for Anglo 
and Hispanic males, respectively). 

DISCUSSION 

In interpreting the data, three possible data 
limitations should be kept in mind. First, 
suicide, to an unknow,i erJent, is understated 
as a cause ofdeath in vital statistics (16). This 
understatement is a result of difficulty in es- 
tablishing suicidal intent, practical considera- 
tions (such as a loss of insurance benefits), 
and the social stigma associated with suicide 
(which seems to be particularly important 
among youth). 

Although it has been suggested that suicide 
rates for Mexican Americans may be under- 
estimated, it is unlikely that underreporting 
alone is responsible for the low rate of suicide 
among Mexican Americans relative to 
Anglos (19). An investigation of the validity 
of reported suicide rates in eleven western

States (four of which are in our study) did not 
reveal any evidence of systematic bias in 
reporting specific to any race or ethnic group 

(18) . We investigated the possible effect that 
misclassification of suicide deaths as deaths 
due to undetermined causes might have had 
on the difference in the incidence rate of 
suicides for Anglos and Hispanics. We found 
that the difference could not be explained by 
a large number of Hispanic deaths being clas- 
sified as "cause undetermined". Even if we 
assumed the most extreme case, that is, no 
suicides by Anglos were misclassified as 
"cause undetermined", and all deaths of 
Hispanics classified as due to undetermined 
causes were actually suicides, the rate of 
suicide would still be two times greater for 
Anglos than for Hispanics. 

A second possible data limitation is the un- 
known extent to which undocumented aliens 
in the Hispanic population are under- 
represented in the CPS sample. The CPS is 
a sample of housing units and f'^^'udes all 
persons who occupy a housing unit, without 
regard to residency status. No evidence indi- 
cates a differential enumeration of Anglos 
and Hispanics in the CPS data we used. Fur- 
thermore, if an undernumeration of 
Hispanics in the CPS data does occur, then 
the true Hispanic suicide rate is lower than 
reported in this paper, and hence, even more 
disparate from the Anglo suicide rates. 

A third possible data limitation is the un- 
known extent to which different methods of 
determining Hispanic ethnicity affect the 
rates, namely, Spanish surname (for vital 
statistics) and self-identification (for popula- 
tion statistics). Self-identification as used by 
the U.S. Census Bureau has been suggested 
as an important way to establish a consistent 
and uniform definition for Spanish ethnicity 

(19) . Vital statistics, however, continue to 
rely on Spanish surname for ethnic iden- 
tification because of problems encountered 
with self-reporting of ethnicity on the death 
certificate**.

Sutittia in the Ave couthwestern States. 



The statistical patterns of suicides by Anglos 
in the five southwestern States were similar 
to the statistical patterns of suicides by age, 
sex, and method for whites nationally (20). 
However, Hispanics in the same five south- 
western States had some important differen- 
ces in patterns of suicide when compared 
with Anglos, and hence, with whites nation- 
ally. 

^srhaps the most important difference in 
suicide patterns for Anglos and Hispanics 
was that the incidence of suicide for 
Hispanics was approximately half the in- 
cidence for Anglos. Very few studies cited in 
the literature have looked at the incidence of 
suicide for Hispanics (5,6,7) and these 
studies report only local data. Two of these 
studies (in El Paso (6) and Denver (7)) 
focused on Mexican Americans and can be 
compared with our findings because popula- 
tion statistics (10) indicate that almost 90 per- 
cent of Hispanics in the five southwestern 
States are Mexican American. As in our 
study, both of these studies found suicide 
rates for Mexican Americans to be ap- 
proximately half the rates for Anglos. 

A second major difference in the patterns of 
suicide for Anglos and Hispanics was the 
comparatively small proportion of suicides by 
Hispanic females compared with the propor- 
tion of suicides by Hispanic males. Our study 
found that the sex ratio for suicides by Anglos 
was similar to the sex ratio for suicides by 
whites nationally (21). We found, however, 
that among Hispanics, the ratio of male to 
female suicides was greater than that for 
Anglos in every age group. Overall, the 
suicide rate for Hispanic males was more 
than four times greater than the rate for 
Hispanic females. The higher Hispanic sex 
ratio was consistent with i^ndings from the 
studies of suicides by Mexican Americans 
previously cited (6,7), and with a similar 
analysis of local area suicide data in Los An- 
geles (8). A study of age- and sex-specific 
suicide rates for Mexico City for the period 
1975-1978 shows higher suicide rates for 
males than females in every age group, with 
an overall sex ratio of 3.7:1 (22).

J.C.Smith: Hispanic Suicide In the Southwest, 1980-1982 



A third and important difference in suicide 
patterns among Anglos and Hispanics was 
that suicide by Hispanics appears to be 
primarily a youthful phenomenon. Much at- 
tention has been focused on the increasing 
rate of suicide among persons under age 25 
(23-32). During the period 1%2-1972, the 
suicide rate for whites 15 to 25 years of age 
increased by almost 75 percent, while the 
suicide rate for whites of all ages increased by 
less than 10 percent (28). The finding that 
Hispanic victims were younger than Anglo 
victims in the five southwestern States is 
similar to the findings of other local area 
studies (6,7,8)- 

The 1990 health objective for the United 
States for suicide identifies young persons 15 
to 24 years of age as the population on whom 
to focus national suicide prevention and in- 
tervention efforts (33,34). It appears from 
our findings that the 1990 objective which 
focuses on youth suicide is quite appropriate 
for the Hispanic population, since the higher 
suicide rates for Hispanics are in the 20-24 
year age group. Furthermore, our study 
shows that while the overall suicide rate for 
Hispanics is half the rate for Anglos, suicide 
rates are equally high for both Anglo and 
Hispanic teenage males (15-19 year age 
group) (17.1 and 17.7, respectively). 

There were some notable similarities in 
suicide patterns among Anglos and 
Hispanics. First, in both ethnic groups, more 
suicides occurred among males than females 
in every age group. Second, the distribution 
of age-specific suicide rates was bimodal for 
both Anglo and Hispanic males and 
unimodal for Anglo and Hispanic females 
which is similar to the national patterns for 
white males and females (35). Third, the sex- 
specific patterns of methods used for suicide 
were similar for the two ethnic groups and 
consistent with sex-specific patterns for 
whites nationally (35). 

Differences in the patterns of Anglo and 
Hispanic suicide probably reflect an interplay 
between the effects of the diminishing in- 
fluence of Mexican cultural traditions, the in- 
creasing influence of American culture, and 



the marginal socioeconomic status of 
Mexican Americans. Horowitz (36), in a 
study of culture and identity in a Chicano 
community in Chicago, identified two values 
heavily stressed in Mexican cultural tradition 
which are likely to protect against suicide: 
the concept of family honor and an emphasis 
on close family ties. A cultural incentive not 
to dishonor one's family with a suicide and 
the ability of close family ties to decrease the 
risk of social isolation may work together to 
diminish an individual's risk of suicide. 
Whether the incidence of suicide increases in 
the Mexican American population in the fu- 
ture may depend in part on the extent to 
which these cultural traditions continue to be 
held within Mexican American communities. 

The assimilation of Mexicans into the 
American culture has undoubtedly 
diminished the power of cultural traditions to 
influence behavior, particularly among 
Hispanic youth (36). This may be reflected 
in the younger ages of Hispanic suicide vic- 
tims uncovered in ihis study. Suicide rates 
among younger Hispanics were more similar 
to those for younger Anglos than rates for 
older Hispanics were when compared to 
those for older Anglos (Figures 1 and 2). 
Hispanic youths may be caught between the 
influence of traditional values and norms and 
their experiences in the larger social order 
which are likely to be heavily influenced by 
their marginal socioeconomic status. 

Psychiatric illness is most likely an important 
contributor to suicide among Anglos and 
Hispanics. In the general population, it has 
been estimated that 47 percent of all suicides 
occur in persons with serious depression or 
major affective disorders (37). The patterns 
and differences presented in this paper sug- 
gest that cultural and social variables may 
modify the expression and/or course of 
psychiatric illness in very important ways. 

Few data are available to analyze and explain 
the differences and similarities between 
suicide rates for Anglos and Hispanics. 
Regarding the availability of data for 
Hispanics, we agree with Braucht, et al: "Un- 
fortunately, the entire group of Hispanic

heritage Americans of Mexican, Puerto 
Rican and Cuban origin are buried within the 
'white' group in near^ all available reports of 
data from the national vital statistics system 
and are not available for separate analysis. 
This state of affairs has resulted in an appall- 
ing lack of knowledge about the mortality of 
the Hispanic population in this country" (38). 
Further, Petzl pointed out that the meager 
amount of research done on suicide among 
minorities has largely focused on blacks and 
American Indians (28). This is because 
blacks and American Indians represent racial 
rather than ethnic categories, and can be 
studied through existing published vital 
statistics data. 

Although the lack of data on the health status 
of Hispanics is recognized (39) and better 
data is promised for the future (40), we are 
left for the present without sufficient data to 
examine why suicide patterns for Anglos and 
Hispanics differ in incidence and by age and 
sex. 

To explore reasons for differences and 
similarities between suic'de rates of Anglos 
and Hispanics, it would be useful to have data 
on such variables as employment, education, 
family composition, and length of residence 
in the United States. With these data, one 
could begin to test hypotheses related to in- 
teractions between the cultural, 
socioeconomic, and experiential factors of 
the two ethnic groups and perhaps explain 
the differential incidence of suicide.

THE ROLE OF VOLUNTEER WORKERS IN SUICIDE 
PREVENTION CENTERS 



Barbara P. W^att, Arlington, Virginia 

Lay volunteers have been called the most im- 
portant single discovery in the history of 
suicide prevention. Eighty percent of the 
suicide prevention centers in the United 
States operate with non-professional volun- 
teers as their primary staff (3). These centers 
represent the only wide scale use of trained 
lay volunteers for the delivery of clinical ser- 
vices which have traditionally been provided 
by professionals (4). 

volunteers in the 19808 

Volunteerism is a uniquely American 
phenomenon. Throughout our history, 
visitors to this country have observed and 
remarked upon the resourcefulnes of 
Americans in organizing themselves and 
giving of their time, their money, and their 
talenfi to address their common problems. It 
has been estimated that today, more than 37 
million volunteers actively participate in 
community programs and services 
throughout the United States (2). 

The stereotypical view of volunteers as non- 
professional suburban housewives-which 
perhaps was accurate twenty years ago-is 
well out of date in 1986. Since 1975, the num- 
ber of women employed outside the home 
has exceeded the; number of full-time 
homemakers. Organizations such as the 
Junior League, Girl Scouts, PTA, and the 
League of Women Voters, whose work had 
for years depended upon an apparently inex- 
haustable supply of suburban homemakers, 
contracted severely during the past decade. 



At the same time, organizations directed at 
solving speciHc community problems such as 
drug abuse, mental retardation, physical 
handicaps, and suicide have generally been 
able to recruit enough volunteers to staff 
their programs. The gap left by homemakers 
entering the workforce has been Hlled large- 
ly by single working professionals, retired 
professionals, and disabled people (6). 

Given the demands upon their time as well as 
their professional experience, today's volun- 
teers tend to be highly selective about the 
programs with which they become involved. 
They actively pursue their own interests and 
often look for opportunities that are directly 
relevant to their professional careers or 
which will reflect favorably upon them in a 
career context. This kind of pragmatic 
altruism-as opposed to altruism for its own 
sake-has produced a new breed of volun- 
teers who are educated, skilled and highly 
motivated. 

In the past decade, many corporations began 
to support their employees' volunteer pur- 
suits both by allowing employees reasonable 
amounts of time away from work to engage 
in approved volunteer activities and by en- 
couraging and even underwriting the forma- 
tion of in-house volunteer organizations 
which participate in various community ser- 
vice programs. While these corporations are 
certainly not unmindful of the public rela- 
tions 'alue of their effort, they are also 
aware that many, if not most, of these ac- 
tivities deal with issues and problems that

directly eCfect employees' lives and health. 
When the cost of absenteeism, impaired 
productivity, and health insurance is taken 
into account, corporate support of volun- 
teerism may reasonably be viewed as good 
business practice as well as good public rela- 
tions. 

It should also be noted that departments and 
agencies of the United States government, as 
well as the United States military and many 
State and local government organizations, 
endorse many employee volunteer activities 
and support participatory volunteer 
programs. 

Development of Suicide 
Prevention Services 

In 1960, there were fewer than half a dozen 
suicide prevention centers in the United 
States. By the end of the 1960's, there were 
more than 100 centers; by the end of the 
1970's, approximately 200. Approximately 
200 centers are still in operation. During the 
three decades, 1950-1980, the overall suicide 
rate in the United States remained roughly 
static. Therefore, it may be inferred that the 
growth of suicide prevention centers cone- 
lates to increased awareness of the problem, 
the technology (telephone) to respond to it, 
and the mobilization of concerned citizens 
who were willing to undertake action to deal 
with it (3). 

Suicide prevention centers are sometimes 
controversial undertakings within a com- 
munity. Such controversy may have a nega- 
tive impact on a center's ability to win 
community endorsement, recruit volunteer 
workers, and raise funds which are vital to its 
existence since the services it provides are 
free. 

Part of this controversy is rooted in the stig- 
ma still associated with suicide in western 
society. Many people are uncomfortable dis- 
cussing the subject and seek to avoid it al- 
together. Others may even deny that the 
problem exists in their community Still 
othsrs believe that discussion of suicide and 
the advertisement of prevention services will

actually cause or inspire suicidal acts. While 
empirical data do not support the latter view, 
facts do not necessarily reverse emotionally 
derived opinions. 

Because there had been no consensus oi ex- 
pert professional opinion on the operation 
and ethical conduct of suicide prevention 
centers until recently, some centers have 
found themsehres inadvertently in conflict 
with local medical societies, social service 
agencies, law enforcement authorities, 
courts, churches, or other community or- 
ganizations and institutions. In the early 
19805, the American Association of Suicidol- 
ogy (AAS) promulgated operating standards 
for crisis intervention centers as well as train- 
ing and performance evaluation criteria for 
volunteer crisis workers. An accreditation 
program, under the aegis of AAS, has made 
significant progress in alleviating public dis- 
trust and professional skepticism about crisis 
intervention techniques and volunteer crisis 
workers. 

Organization and Structure of 
Suicide Prevention Centers 

The organization and structure of suicide 
prevention centers is determined by the ser- 
vices offered, '^v. minimum service is usual- 
ly a telephone iioUine whose basic mission is 
to respond to people in crisis. This response 
might involve sympathetic listening and "talk- 
ing things through," referral to professional 
counseling services, or initiating emergency 
intervention in the case of immediately life- 
threatening circumstances. Depending on 
their fmancial and staff resources, some 
centers have expanded their services to in- 
clude public awareness and education 
programs, extensive contact and foUowup 
programs with callers to the center, and grief 
counseling services for families of victims. 

A center's organizational structure typically 
includes an advisory board and/or board of 
directors, executive director, consulting staff, 
administrative and clerical stiff, and lay 
volunteer staff. The center crald also be ex- 
pected to have ongoing working relation- 
ships with community emergency services, 




221 



3-207 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



social service agencies, mental health ser- 
vices, hospitals, and private health care 
providers. 

Distinction should be made among three 
categories of personnel and levels of involve- 
ment with the center's operations: 

1. Paid staff: Usually the executive 
director and at least a portion of the 
full-time administrative and clerical 
staff. 

2. Professionally-trained volun- 
teers (e.g., mental health profes- 
sionals): Usually members of the 
advisory board and the consulting 
staff who donate their professional 
expertise and services in support of 
the center. 

3. Lay volunteers: Non-profes- 
sionals who have been trained to 
provide those crisis intervention ser- 
vices which have traditionally been 
provided only by professionals. 

While crisis intervention workers are typical- 
ly lay volunteers, it is not unusual for profes- 
sionally trained people to volunteer to 
answer hotlines and serve on crisis interven- 
tion teams. Both Motto and McGee em- 
phasize that all crisis intervention staff, 
regardless of their professional training, as 
well as all consulting staff, should be required 
to go through the same training programs as 
lay volunteers and should be subject to the 
same monitoring and evaluation procedures. 
Further, Motto and McGee both concluded 
that people v^ith professional training are not 
demonstrably more effective than lay volun- 
teers as crisis intervention workers (3,4). 

McGee goes on to say that conflicts between 
lay volunteers and professionals who become 
d irectly involved in delivery of crisis interven- 
tion services can present a signiHcant chal- 
lenge to center management. He urges that 
all crisis workers be measured exclusively 
against the center's overall performance 
standards, irrespective of any individual's 
professional credentials or lack thereof. 



Recruiting and Screening of 
Volunteers 

Volunteer recruiting is probably a full-time 
job at most suicide prevention centers. Sour- 
ces of volunteers include the general public, 
college students (especially graduate stu- 
dents), faculty members, corporations, 
government entities with active volunteer 
programs, and community volunteer 
bureaus. 

Unpaid advertising is the most usual method 
of volunteer recruiting. This may take the 
form of notices in newspaper columns, public 
service announcements, and flyers and 
posters distributed to target groups and or- 
ganizations. A public relations campaign in- 
volving media interviews and speeches by a 
center spokesperson before local civic 
groups and professional organizations may 
also be incorporated into the overall recruit- 
ing effort 

Paid advertising, such as classified newspaper 
advertisemen is another alternative. 
However, since suicide prevention centers 
often operate on tight budgets, paid advertis- 
ing may be viewed as less effective than a 
resourceful volunteer recruiter. 

The initial screening process begins with an 
interview at the center. Upon arrival, the 
volunteer may be asked to complete a per- 
sonal data sheet which includes general back- 
ground information. The respondent is then 
interviewed by two or three designated inter- 
viewers. These interviewers might be some 
combination of consulting staff, mental 
health professionals, center administrators, 
and active volunteer staff. Psychological 
testing may reasonably be incorporated into 
the screening process. Initial screening may 
involve two or three visits to the center, 
which is in itself a method of screening. 

The objective of the screening process is to 
elicit information regarding past and present 
life patterns and to provide evidence of emo- 
tional stability, integrity, receptivity to learn- 
ing, perceptiveness, and responsiveness to 
human needs. Incidence of prior suicide at- 
tempts would almost certainly disqualify the

applicant for direct crisis intervention work 
although the person might be assigned to 
other tasks within the center at the 
interviewers' discretion (4). 

Applicants who pass screening interviews 
and testing are accepted into the center's 
training program. Training may be viewed as 
an extension of the screening process since 
some aplicants will drop out or show them- 
selves to be unqualiOed for crisis intervention 
H^ork as they are exposed to the real world 
conditions of the center's operations. 

Training 

Training programs in suicide prevention 
centers idealfy combine theoretical informa- 
tion with practical experience in crisis inter- 
vention. A thorough training program 
requires 18 to 25 hours of concentrated ses- 
sions extending over a three to six week 
period plus concurrent parallel reading. 

Elements of a good training program include: 

• orientation to the center's methods of 
operation, record keeping procedures, 
performance criteria, and ethical stand- 
ards. 

• lectures by mental health professionals 
and suicidologists. 

• films, video tapes, selected reading. 

• listening to audio tapes of actual calls to 
hotlines (with all personal identification 
information removed). 

• role playing. 

• observing actual phone calls to the cen- 
ter. 

« «A jrking on the phones under close su- 
pervision. 

By the end of the training period, volunteers 
have been gradually introduced into their 
roles as crisis intervention workers and there 
has been ample opportunity to discover in- 
dividuals who are obviously unsuited for the 
job. 

McGee reports some instances in which lay 
volunteers were given no formal training but 



were put directly to work on the telephones 
and trained on the job, as it v.'ere, after they 
had been interviewed. In other cases, volun- 
teers were put through marathon two and 
three day training sessions and began work 
immediately thereafter. While the results of 
the short but intensive training sessions have 
not been evaluated in comparison with the 
longer sessions, it is thought that one object 
of the marathon sessions was to produce a 
large number of volunteer workers very 
quickly while the longer, more deliberate ses 
sions were aimed at producing genuinely 
dedicated volunteers who were likely to 
remain with the center over a long period of 
time (3). 

Some centers do not use lay volunteers at all 
but depend upon psychiatrists, psychologists, 
nurses, clergymen, and other professional 
counselors to serve as crisis workers. Train- 
ing may be bypassed altogether in the belief 
that thjse people are already sufficiently 
trained to counsel people in crisis. Ex- 
perience indicates, however, that crisis inter- 
vention and suicide prevention work require 
unique and special skills. Specialized train- 
ing for all who are engaged in suicide preven- 
tion should be considered mandatory (4). 

Regular and systematic in-service training is 
also highly recommended. Extended train- 
ing may take the form of lectures, seminars, 
or free-for-all discussion sessions. Oppor- 
tunities for the exchange of information, ex- 
periences, ideas, and even complaints are 
vital to the success of the center's work and 
to maintaining staff morale in a highly stress- 
ful environment. It should be remembered 
that volunteers- particularly those who work 
late night and weekend shifts-may have lit- 
tle or no face-to-face contact with center per- 
sonnel, consulting staf, and other volunteers 
unless such sessions are deliberately initiated 
and scheduled. 

Equally necessary is regular evaluation of the 
crisis worker's performance. Observation of 
the worker taking calls and review of written 
case records prepared by the volunteer are 
an essential part of center management and 
can constitute the basis for performance 



223 



3-209 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



evaluations as well. When these procedures 
are combined with regular personal discus- 
sions with consulting staff and center ad- 
ministrators, performance evaluation can 
become a part of the volunteer's continuing 
in-service training (4). 

Program Implementation 

The programs of a suicide crisis center can be 
divided into three broad categories: 

1. prevention, which includes 
education and awareness programs; 

2. intervention, which includes 
telephone hotlines and emergency 
services; and 

3. postvention, which inc-.udes fol- 
lowup, outreach, and counseling for 
the families of victims. 

As a practical matter, chronology does not 
reflect the evolution and focus of the crisis 
center. Intervention is the center's initial 
and principal "reason for being," while 
prevention and postvention programs, and 
services are later outgrowths and extensions 
of a successful center's basic service. 

Intervention 

The telephone is the basic tool of crisis inter- 
vention. Some centers limit their service ex- 
clusively to hotlines, while others have 
walk-in facilities and/or crisis inteivention 
teams which go to the caller's location in ex- 
treme emergencies. In 80 percent of all 
suicide intervention centers, the people who 
answer the phones and respond to emergen- 
cy situations are volunteers. 

As back-up resources, volunteer workers 
may have access to the center's consulting 
staff, private practitioners who take referrals 
from the center, law enforcement and emer- 
gency medical personnel, and community so- 
cial service and mental health agencies. 

The basic job of the crisis worker is first, to 
establish communications with the caller and 
second, to make an assessment of the caller's 
condition (lethality assessment). In the case 



of an immediately life-threatening situation- 
which is a relatively infrequent occurrence- 
the first priority is to determine the caller's 
location and dispatch assistance. 

More usually, the crisis worker's role is to es- 
tablish a rapport with the caller, to listen to 
the person's description of his problems, and 
to work with him in setting a course of action. 
Shneidman has suggested that the role of a 
therapist is that of ombudsman for the 
patient; the same can be said of the crisis 
worker vis-a-vis his client. The worker's ob- 
jective IS to increase the options available to 
the caller, to reduce the caller's sense of pain 
and isolation, to listen, to offer hope and 
help, to suggest alternatives, to play for time, 
and with the caller's permission, to involve 
others (7). 

Some centers actively discourage any face- 
to-face involvement between crisis workers 
and clients. On the other hand, many centers 
allow workers, at their own discretion, to 
meet callers away from the center's premises 
while cautioning against over-involvement in 
any particular case. Other centers train 
selected workers to follow the progress of 
clients through individual personal visits. 

Crisis teams are another alternative. Usual- 
ly comprised of two people, teams are care- 
fully selected and trained to go out into the 
community and intervene directly in life- 
threatening situations. There may be some 
risks to the worker's personal safety in these 
circumstances, and there is certainly a 
greater likelihood of a worker's becoming 
over-involved with a particular case (4). 
Nevertheless, crisis teams have proven to be 
highly effective in many instances. 

Once a crisis center has established its 
reputation in the community, it is not unusual 
for police, Hre-rescue services, and hospitals 
to request that a crisis intervention team be 
sent to a location where a suicide emergency 
is in progress. This represents acknow- 
ledgement by law enforcement and emergen- 
cy services personnel that crisis intervention 
is indeed highly specialized work and best un- 
dertaken by those who are specifically

trained for it. 

The variety of approaches and techniques 
used in crisis intervention are limited only by 
the center's financial resources and the time 
constraints of its volunteer crisis workers. 

Prevention 

Many suicide prevention centers assume the 
responsibility for community awareness and 
education. While the responsibility for these 
initiatives and programs is largely within the 
purview of the professionals affiliated with 
the center, volunteer crisis workers may be 
included in a particular program designed for 
a particular group. For example, coUege-nge 
crisis workers have been shown to be espe- 
cially effective in working with teenagers, 
presumably because their proximity in age 
engender a natural rapix)rt (1). 

Again, methods and approachet. vary widely 
and are limited only by the center's resources 
and the ingenuity of its staff. 

Postvention 

Postvention refers to foUowup and outreach 
activities directed to individuals following a 
suicide attempt and to counseling services for 
families of suicide victims. 

In addition to following up at regular inter- 
vals the progress cf caller^ to the center, out- 
reach may also involve responding to 
referrals from hospital emergency rooms, law 
enforcement authorities, social service agen- 
cies, clergy, teachers, and other concerned 
individuals. In these cases, the center in- 
itiates contact, e' ther by telephone or by per- 
sonal visit, with people who have attempted 
suicide and extends an offer of help. 

Ross describes another approach called 
"Befirienders" in which volunteers who were 
able to give large amounts of time were 
selected to befriend and work with particular 
individuals who had attempted suicide. 
Befrienderswerecarefully matched to clients 
on the basis of personality, attitudes, sex and 
age, and were thoroughly briefed in advance 
on the details of the case to which they were 



assigned. They were required to be available 
for personal visits several hours each week 
an'* to be available by tele(ihone as much of 
the remaining time as possible. Obviously, 
this involves a substantial time commitment 
on the part of the volunteer be&iender; 
however, results of the program as an alter- 
native means of post-episode care were con- 
sidered encouraging (5). 

Outreach programs directed toward provid- 
ing support to families of suicide victims 
during the bereavement process may be in- 
itiated in response to a family's request for 
help in coping with their grief. In other in- 
stances, the center might be contacted by 
coroners, hospital emergency room staff, 
funeral directors, or concerned friends who 
are aware of the circumstances and the 
family's need for assistance. 

In some grief counseling programs, the cen- 
ter serves as facilitator in establishing contact 
and networks among families who have suf- 
fered the same tragedy. The center may also 
provide referrals to professional counselors 
and offer seminars and discussion programs 
dealing with the particular problems of sur- 
vivors. Special attention is paid to siblings of 
adolescent victims who are known to be a 
particularly high risk. Volunteer crisis 
workers are, of course, involved in the 
delivery of all of these services. 

As a corollary to postvention programs, some 
crisis workers are trained to conduct 
psychological autopsies. This involves 
gathering information from those closest to 
the victim which may shed light on the exter- 
nal events and family dynamics leading up to 
the suicide. Because of their training, crisis 
workers often reccjnize the significance of 
information that may have been ignored or 
overlooked by family, friends, and others in- 
volved in the case. Such formation is often 
valuable to researchers J therapists who 
are trying to understand and deal with self- 
destructive behavic 

CONCLUSION 

Volunteerism is a time-honored custom, in-

deed almost an obligation of American life; 
but to equate volunteerism with amateurism 
is to do an injustice to volunteers everywhere. 
In no case is this more evident than in volun- 
teer crisis workers. Crisis intervention 
workers are skilled and talented people who 
take their wc rk very seriously. Most of them 
have undergone er*ensive training and 
devote a minimum of six hours per week to 
their "volunteer" work. Their contributions 
to suicide prevention have been recognized 
by the American Association of Suicidology 
which, since 1972, has admitted qualified 
volunteers to fiiU AAS membership. 

To call crisis intervention workers lay volun- 
teers and non-profesaionals detracts from 
their level of training, skill and commitment. 
They have earned the respect of their profes- 
sional colleagues and they have earned the 
right to be called para-professionals.

PREVENTING SUICIDE BY IMPROVING THE 
COMPETENCY OF CAREGIVERS 



Bryan L Tanney, M.D., F.R.C.P., Clinical Director, Psychiatric Emergency Services, Calgary 
General Hospital, Calgary, Alberta, Canada 



SUMMARY 

All caregivek's should be competent in the 
tsf'ks needed to make direct, personal, and 
immediate interventions with persons-at-risk 
for suic: dal behaviors, especially when a per- 
son is active^ considering suicide. The core 
taskis of recognition, risk rating and 
resource referral define the role of a 
"gatekeeper" in the intervention process. A 
review of caregivers' competency in this role 
emphasizes the need for better learning and 
training experiences in suicide. Available 
learning resources are summarized. The cur- 
riculum of a program that aims to prevent 
suicide by improving the gatekeeping skills of 
all caregivers is described, along with the in- 
frastructure for delivering a two-day presen- 
tation to large numbers of caregivers. The 
Foundation Workshop described in this 
paper has successful^ involved more than 
4,000 participants. Prospects and pitfalls for 
its expansion to a larger, perhaps national, 
level are briefly discussed. 

INTRODUCTION 

Even in the most ideal of situations, not all 
suicides are preventable. The belief that 
some, and probably the majority, are 
preventable sustains the efforts of helpers to 
persons-at-risk for suicide. But the continu- 
ing and apparently increasing rate of suicide 
implies that helping efforts of all kinds are 
not as successful as might be hoped. 



Befr re discarding the accumulated experien- 
ces of efforts in suicide prevention as un- 
workable and demanding a new direction 
with innovative prevention strategies, it is im- 
portant to realize that the impact of helping 
efforts has alv/ays been difflcult to evaluate 
accurately. Only the outcomes of unsuccess- 
ful interventions, which result in suicide at- 
tempts or completed suicides, are recorded 
and the difficulties in obtaining accurate and 
reliable statistics are well known. In addi- 
tion, few studies claim to have sufflciently 
controlled all of the many environmental, 
personal, and historical variables which lead 
to a decision for suicide. In dedning the 
directions for suicide prevention activities, 
we are still in an age of empiricism. The 
choice of effective prevention strategies 
must derivt; from the rationale and the 
rationality of the proposals themselves. 

THE RATIONALE FOR 
"PREVENTION BY 
INTERVINTION" 

An episode of suicidal behavior is initiated 
when a person actively considers suicide as a 
problem-solving behavior, usually as a result 
of some precipitant stressor* An episode is 
usually time-limited and persons may ex- 
perience one or more during their lifetime. 
Every episode demands therapeutic atten* 
tion* Self-destructive behavior is not a pre- 
requisite in the definition of an episode,

although it offers the best index or marker of 
the experience. We suggest that the time im- 
mediately proximal to the suicidal behavior, 
a prelude phase, is a focal point for rational, 
effective, and high impact suicide prevention 
activities by any caregiver (Figure 1). 

A number of similarities have been recog- 
nized in persons-at-risk during this prelude 
to suicidal behavior. Ringel (48) described it 
as the pre-suicidal state. Shneidman charac- 
terized the thought process during this time 
as one of constriction, and more recently he 
has described a number of other com- 
monalities (S3). If the thoughts, feelings, and 
actions of those contemplating suicide share 
some common features, then caregivers can 
devise intervention responses and activities 
applicable to any episode and any person-at- 
risk, whatever the origins, predisposing fac- 
tors, or immediate precipitants. The 
interactions between a person at risk and the 
caregiver's planned activities together make 
up the process of suicide intervention. The 
process can be described and modelled, and 
roles, tasks (and accompanying skills), as- 
signed to both partners in the interaction 
(34). 



The duration of this pre-suicidal or prelude 
phase is variable, but it is estimated tha» 80 
percent of persons-at-risk warn of their 
movement towards self-destruction during 
this time (14,24,33,49,62). These cries for 
help communicate distress and ambivalence 
as well as statements about suicidal intent. 
Because the outcome too often is suicidal be- 
havior, we must conclude that many of these 
"care-eliciting behaviors" (28) are unsuccess- 
ful. 

Why is this so? It must not be assumed that 
the directed communications of the suicidal 
person are ambiguous, unclear, or directed to 
the wrong person. They are often repeated 
and directed towards more than one poten- 
tial helper or resource (12,49). Some 23 dif- 
ferent studies confirm that medical 
caregivers have significant amounts of direct 
contact with persons-at-risk in the time 
preceding suicidal behaviors (references 
available). Though less exact, similar data in- 
dicates that other helpers are also ap- 
proached (13,24,33). To understand why 
these directol communications apparently 
fail to generate caring ant> helping from 
others, we must look to the helpers-those

who receive the messages of distress. Who 
are these helpers? A medical doctor is the 
first choice of those who seek formal help for 
suicidal or mental health crises (13,26,51,56) 
although many and diverse other c&regivers 
are also approached. The caregivers avail- 
able for help and support during a suicidal be- 
havior episode can be defined as emergent or 
designated (45). Designated caregivers have 
received training to act in a specific helping 
role to suicidal persons. Emergent 
caregivers do not have this background, but 
may have the opportunity to prevent suicidal 
behavior as the person to whom a person-at- 
risk turns for help. 

What is the helper's role? Some caregiving 
persons offer support to the person-at-risk 
while others work directly to resolve the 
suicidal situation. The aim for all caregivers 
is to prevent suicide as the outcome of the 
episode. Terminating the episode by closing 
the door to suicide and opening or re-open- 
ing alternative actions and solutions is an ac- 
tive process of intervention and involvement. 
The caregiver in this process has been called 
a "helper of the first instance" (6) or a 
frontline worker, but the role itself is well 
described as that of "gatekeeper" (56). The 
gatekeeper's role includes specific com- 
petencies in suicide prevention activities as 
well as effective use of interpersonal and 
communication skills. Not all of the neces-

saiy skills have been defined, but the role-re- 
lated tasks include: 1) recognizing the risk of 
suicide (Schapira's "spotter" 52); 2) rating the 
degree of suicidal risk; 3) referring to ap- 
propriate resources. We call these the 5 R's: 
Recognition, Risk Rating, and Resource 
Refenal. If competence in these tasks were 
expected of all caregivers, we believe that 
many episodes ending in suicidal behaviors 
would be effectively prevented. 

THE PRESENT STATUS OF 
CAREGIVERS AS 
GATEKEEPERS 

A. Prior Education and Training 
Experiences 

Professional schools and clinical disciplines 
offer few organized courses in the study of 
suicidal behavior (44). Presentations daring 
clinical practicum experiences review suicide 
risk factors, but virtually ignore therapeutic, 
clinical, personal, and professional issues. In 
two studies, 90 percent (62) and 48 percent 
(50) of physicians surv^ed recalled no in- 
struction in suicidal behaviors during their 
professional medical training. Boldt (6) 
found that more than 90 percent of 143 
reporting agencies had no workers with any 
significant training in this area. More that 50 
percent of caregivers participating in our 
program recalled no prior learning experien- 
ces in the area of suicide. (See Table 1.) 

B. Self-Perceptions 

Forty-four (58) and 58 percent (50) of 
physicians surveyed indicated a desire or will- 
ingness to learn more about the area of 
suicide. In a membership survey of the 
Canadian Association for Suicide Prevention 
(8) these caregivers already involved in the 
fleld clearly expressed a need for more infor- 
mation and training in dealing with persons- 
at-risk. 

C. Reports and Recommendations 

Throughout this century, the need for better 
<'ducation and preparation of caregivers has 




'2? 'J 



3-215 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



been emphasized by both educators and 
suicide researchers. The first recommenda- 
lion of a World Health Organization Work- 
ing Group (10) stated that training in the 
detection and management of suicidal per- 
sons should be a requirement in the educa- 
tion of all professional helpers in the field of 
public mental health. 

D. Knowledge and Skills 

Three of four studies (7,27,30,47) assessing 
family physicians' responses to a multiple 
choice questionnaire about suicide produced 
disappointing scores. Three studies involv- 
ing different groups of designated caregivers 
(29,30,47) found that their medical prac- 
titioners achieved the highest score of any of 
the groups tested. Other studit^s reported a 
better response to major clinical issues in- 
volved in the recognition and management of 
suicidal persons than to strictly factual or 
statistical items (30,35,40,50). In comment- 
ing on the knowledge and sldll competence 
of caregivers, there was repeated concern 
with the apparent failure of these caregivers 
to apply the awareness th^ do possess to 
their work with suicidal persons (38). Twen- 
ty percent of Steele's (57) medical students 
and the same percentage of Whittemore's 78 
physicians (62) specifically avoided the issue 
of suicide in clinical situations. 

E. Caregiver Attitudes Towards 
Suicide and Persons-at-Risk 

In working with persons at risk for suicide, 
medical caregivers may be not only un- 
responsive (55) or passive (4), but also over- 
tly hostile. In retrospective chart reviews of 
completed suicides, (5,19,31,61) the 
caregiver's rejection of the patient (at- 
tributed to feelings of hate, hostility, anger, 
and anxiety) is a regular flnding. Surveys of 
caregivers utilizing questionnaires (21,39), 
semantic differentials (2,22), objective 
checklists (15), or the rating of clinical 
vignettes (2,25,43) consistently reflect this 
negative attitude (Table 2). 

Two studies of caregiver's responses to 



suicidal persons support the general finding 
that a therapist's initial attitude and emotion- 
al reactions are of crucial significance to his 
clinical decision-making (15,25). Although 
positive and supportive attitudes appear to 
develop with increased contact with suicidal 
persons (22,23,39,62), the majority of 
caregivers do not regularly encounter 
suicidal persons in the course of their clinical 
practices. There is also disagreement about 
the congruency between personal and 
professional attitudes toward suicidal per- 
sons (2:^42). If caregivers' attitudes, both 
personal and professional, can be the source 
of significant resistance to their becoming ef- 
fective agents for suicide prevention, it is im- 
portant that training experiences ensure the 
opportunity for open discussion of these is- 
sues (17). 

These observations about caregiver com- 
petence in preventing suicide are disquieting. 
There is a definite and recognized deficiency 
in the abilities and attitudes of caregivers to 
undertake this helping role. If caregiver in- 
terventions are to be a successful strategy for 
suicide prevention, additional training is 
needed to upgrade the competencies of 
caregivers in the tasks that ensure successful 
intervention.

materials are part of the ep»w ;eral litera- 
ture. The support of the Suicide Information 
and Education Center enabled a review of 
these materials, which mcluded the op^ -^t- 
tunity to view more than ISO audio-vi&..iil 
productions. Additional information was 
gained in an informal survey of 
trainer/educators active in delivering suicide 
prevention learning racperiences. 

A. Content 

A recognizable body of "core knowledge" 
(36, p.23) needed for the gatekeeping role 
and a scientific literature supportive of this 
content is readily available and well docu- 
mented. For example, cues and clues to 
recognizing the person-at-risk have changed 
little since the suggestions made by Sym (S9) 
and Fairbank (18). In the curriculum con- 
tent of virtually all training/education 
programs reviewed, mastery of the tasks of 
the gatekeeping role (5 R's) is included in the 
participant objectives. The content of audio- 
visual productions intended for caregiver 
audiences is more restricted with major em- 
phasis on the task of rating suicidal risk. Only 
one audiovisual attended to care^'ver at- 
titudes (11) and fewer than a half dozen 
specifically deal with the intervention 
process (3,9,32,41). A similar emphasis on 
the risk rating task was noted in the cur- 
riculum and program outlines. 

B. Formats for Learning Materials 

Written text (books, papers, or monographs) 
continue to be the major format for present- 
ing materials on suicidal behavior to 
caregiver audiences. Some variant of the 
"Facts and Myths" questionnaire (54) is the 
most standardized and widely used learning 
aid available. Although often not developed 
for caregiver audiences, the number of 
audio-visual productions related to suicidal 
behaviors has doubled in the past decade. 
The most modem incorporates video disc 
and computer technology in a self-directed 
learning experience (20). 



C. Learning Experiences 

A comprehensive review of issues concern- 
ing education and training in suicidology 
stressed the need to develop "imaginative dis- 
semination programs" (36, p.23). A learning 
experience in suicide prevention should in- 
clude: 1) a curriculum outlining content, ob- 
jectives, and the schedule of learning 
experiences; 2) available learning materials 
in different formats that are supportive of 
and integrated with the content and process 
of learning and; 3) available background 
materials which adequately prepare the 
trainer or educator presenting the program. 
There are many learning experiences in 
suicide prevention that meet these standards. 
Although their curriculum content may be 
remarkably similar, most programs were uni- 
quely developed for a particular and 
homogeneous audience of caregivers usually 
defmed by the group to whom their helping 
services are directed; for example, crisis or 
distress center workers, correctional institu- 
tion personnel, school board employees. 

Curriculum developers and trainers both 
agree that one day (7 hours) of caregiver par- 
ticipation is a minimum requirement and the 
inclusion of practicum and/or simulation ac- 
tivities often lengthens participant committ- 
ment to two or more days. Few experienced 
"disseminators" (36) support the develop- 
ment of presentations that are individualized 
for a particular caregiver group. Ex- 
perienced trainers/educators virtually all 
present a core or foundation of similar 
> material to all caregivers with some tailoring 
of situations and examples to the experiences 
of the participants. 

A program in suicide prevention is more than 
an organized learning experience. In addi- 
tion to meeting all of the criteria for an effec- 
tive learning experience described above, it 
must have: 1) an organizing infrastructure 
that monitors, evaluates and modifies both 
the program and the presentation itself, and 
2) a mechanism for ensuring optimal delivery 
of the learning experience to its intended 
audiences. Two programs that offer stand- 
ardized learning materials intended for 



3-217 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



caregivers of different disciplines and vaiying 
levels of expertise are available. Although 
not fully meeting the standard defined above, 
the Suicide Prevention Training Manual (1) 
has been used widely for almost a decade. 
The other program (9) intended for distribu- 
tion to a broad audience is technically superb 
in content and curriculum materials. Unfor- 
tunately, it was never aggressively marketed 
or promoted, and the materials are no longer 
available from the copyright holder. 

Deciding whether an educational/training 
experience will succeed in improving 
caregiver competency requires consideration 
of learning materials, learning activities, and 
curriculum organization. Rating of suicidal 
risk is the major content focus of most avail- 
able experiences, with almost no attention to 
ensuring caregiver effectiveness in the over- 
all intervention process. There is no 
program presently available and appropriate 
for use by all caregivers that offers integrated 
learning materials and activities in its cur- 
riculum. 

THE FOUNDATION 
WORKSHOP 

Over the past five years, we have developed. 



piloted and successfully implemented a 
program which offers a standardized learning 
experience in the foundations of suicide 
prevention (46). The workshop presenta- 
tion assumes that increasing the competen- 
cies of caregivers in dealing with 
persons-at-risk during an episode that might 
end in suicide is an effective suicide preven- 
tion strategy. The intended audience of the 
program includes caregivers of any discipli- 
nary and theoretical orientation or level of 
expertise. To our knowledge, it has been 
delivered to more caregiver participants than 
any integrated standardized program on 
suicide prevention ever available in North 
America.

B. Developmental History 

In the pilot phase, the workshop was 
presented eight times to a total of 434 par- 
ticipants. The audiences for these presenta- 
tions were caregiver groups, both 
homogeneous and heterogeneous in com- 
position, and included helpers in urban and 
rural communities, childcare workers, staff of 
a psychiatric institution, and native coun- 
selors. Evaluation at the end of the presen 
tation by these diverse groups of caregivers 
supported both the curriculum organization 
and the content focus. 

The development phase required the 
preparation of trainers who could present 
the Foundation Workshop. This prepara • 
tion, to be discussed later, included the 
presentation of the workshop by a co-leader 
or apprentice with a more experienced 
trainer. These apprenticeship presentations, 
involving 27 workshops and 1250 par- 
ticipants, were also used to continue the 
development of the workshop learning ex- 
perience. 

C. Program Evaluation 

At the conclusion of the development phase, 
three experienced trainers in different 
centers across North America were con- 



tracted to review and critique the program 
materials and curriculum. Later, three other 
caregivers reviewed the entire program by 
considering its potential use as a training 
vehicle for a State-wide mental health 
deliveiy system (60). 

Participant evaluations are completed at the 
end of the workshop. Fewer than 1 percent 
of participants drop out during the two day 
experience. There are more requests for an 
extra day or added time than there are 
dropouts. Fewer than 1 percent of par- 
ticipants fail to recommend this workshop to 
other colleagues and caregivers. All modules 
of the workshop receive positive comments, 
with the practical experiences involving both 
large and small group simulations garnering 
the most positive support. It is notable that 
the evaluations of the workshop with respect 
to its value, strengths, and deficiencies are 
remarkably uniform across the different 
groups of participant caregivers. Evaluation 
of the Foundation Workshop's impact on 
caregivers over an extended time span has 
been proposed. 

At present, end of workshop evaluations 
from all participants are centrally reviewed 
by a group of experienced workshop 
presenters. Feedback from this ongoing 
audit is used continuously to adapt and up- 
date the program materials and learning ac- 
tivities. 

Delivery of the Foundation 
Workshop to Ail Caregivers 

The Foundation Workshop is suitable for 
presentation to any group of caregivers inter- 
ested in mastering a lifesaving task. To sus- 
tain this amount of program activity and to 
ensure that the quality of the workshop ex- 
perience is maintained, requires an in- 
frastructure that must be sponsored and 
supported. At the most practical level in this 
structure, the essential component is the 
trainer or educator who delivers the 
workshop presentation. A training program 
which offers certification to trainers, who can 
then conduct the Foundation Workshop, has 
been developed. 



ERIC 



3-219 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



The Training for Trainers program involves 
experience as a workshop participant, fol* 
lowed by a two or three day training ex- 
perience in effective use and understanding 
of the curriculum. Because the stand- 
ardization of both content and process of the 
Foundation Workshop is quite rigorous, a 
300 page curriculum manual (4S) emphasiz- 
ing theory, content, and practical process is 
provided. An apprenticeship program in 
which more experienced trainers assist the 
newly qualified in the presentation of their 
first full workshop is also encouraged. Seven 
presentations of the Training for Trainers 
program have, to this time, involved more 
than 150 potential trainers. 

The model for program delivery requires 
considerable effort and expense before any 
caregivers actually participate in the 
workshop itself. With this large front-end ex- 
penditure, cost-effectiveness increases with 
the involvement of more candidates at a 
Training for Trainers session, and with every 
workshop that is delivered by '.ne certified 
trainers. It in vitally importan. to minimize 
trainer drop-out. This is accomplished by an 
initial screening procedure, by the evaluation 
of readiness for apprenticing at the con- 
clusion of Training for Trainers, and by the 
apprenticing process itself. For certified 
trainers, an active network keeps them up- 
to-date with developments and modifications 
to the workshop information and materials. 
We have been gratified by the 
entrepreneurial spirit that has developed 
within the network of trainers and believe 
that it reflects their ownership, investment, 
and identification with the quality of the 
workshop experience. 

Despite the enthusiasm, it apparent that 
active sponsorship of this program is re- 
quired because of both the heavy initial in- 
vestment and the objective of delivering the 
workshop to a large number of caregivers. 
Several avenues for development are avail- 
able. The development of competency as a 
basic "Rescuer" in cardiopulmonary resus- 
citation (CPR) is a similar task, and this 
program has attracted many organizing spon- 




3-220 



sors. Its success affords a useful model for 
the delivery of a basic learning experience to 
large and diverse groups of caregivers. In the 
area of suicide prevention, the American As- 
sociation of Suicidology could adopt this 
program as part of its objective to certify in- 
dividual caregivers. Professional organiza- 
tions of designated caregivers (physicians, 
nurses, clergy, social workers, psychologists) 
or the administrators of human resources sys- 
tems could make a commitment to offer the 
Foundation Workshop to all of their 
caregivers. Although such support would 
resolve many organizational hurdles, their 
endorsement should only be offered to a 
program of proven excellence. 

While awaiting the support for large-scale 
implementation, it is useful to summarize the 
successes of the Foundation Workshop 
program. Following its original development 
for caregivers in Alberta, Canada, presenta- 
tion of the Foundation Workshop using the 
Training for Trainers delivery model has 
been extended into two other caregiving sys- 
tems, one geographical and the other system- 
based. In addition, pilot presentations to 
special audiences have been offered. These 
included selected inmates of a medium 
security correctional facility who were 
developing a peer support model, and lay 
persons in a number of rural communities 
where the formal network of caregiving sup- 
port resources is diffuse and less important 
then the support provided by family and 
friends. Although unplanned, materials and 
activities from the Foundation Workshop ap- 
pear in courses offered in professional 
schools at three Canadian universities. As of 
April 1986, more than 4000 persons have par- 
ticipated in the Foundation Workshop, and 
two workshops per week are being con- 
ducted by a netv ork of more than 80 certified 
trainers. 

DISCUSSION 

As a model program for upgrading the com- 
petencies of caregivers in effective suicide 
prevention, the experiences of the Founda- 
tion Workshop point to two major issues 



234 



Tanney: . . .Improving the Competency of Caregivers 



which require further consideration. One 
addresses program content, and the other 
concerns the process of delivering the learn- 
ing experience to large numbers of 
caregivers. Both issues have been a focus for 
some resistance to the widespread use of this 
program. 

The content issue questions the effectiveness 
of a general and basic experience in suicide 
prevention^ntervention for audiences of 
caregivers who work almost delusively with 
a specific at-risk population (adolescents, in- 
mates, crisis center clients). This concern is 
surprising because similar content and objec- 
tives can be identified across many of the 
programs available for specialized target 
audiences. Besides discouraging costly 
duplication, we believe that it is very impor- 
tant to encourage a common learning ex- 
perience for all caregivers. A shared baseline 
of competencies across disciplines, 
caregivers, and agencies facilitates com- 
munication between caregivers. Confidence 
in other professionals at this personal level 
strengthens the network of available resour- 
ces and improves the continuity of care for 
persons-at-risk. In several communities and 
institutions, workshop participants who took 
part in simulations dealing with referral to 
appropriate resources within their systems, 
later reported making a similar referral in a 
real-life situation, with the very same 
caregivers in the referring and resource roles. 
Finally, in presenting the Foundation 
Workshop to participants with widely diverse 
formal qualifications and experiences, we 
were struck by a remarkable similarity in both 
the process and the content of the group dis- 
cussions and learning activities across the dif- 
ferent type* of caregivers. 

The support for a basic or Foundation 
program does not imply that learning ac- 
tivities for specialized or targeted caregiver 
groups are not valuable. Parallelling the 
CPR model, it is most appropriate to present 
these materials at a secondary or advanced 
level which can be added after the basic 
Foundation curriculum has been delivered. 
The availability of advanced or specialized 



learning experiences which further develop 
caregiver competencies only increases the 
likelihood of effective suicide prevention. 

Before suggesting any further extension of 
this strategy beyond the basic learning ex- 
perience, it is important to emphasize again 
that improving the competencies in suicide 
intervention of all caregivers is a large and 
daunting task. The program requires a large 
front-end loading in terms of dollars, time, 
and human resources involvement This re- 
quires the continuing support of organiza- 
tions which can maintain and nourish an 
active network of trainers. 

In our efforts to encourage the large-scale 
delivery of the Foundation Workshop, two 
possible sources of resistance by potential 
sponsors have been identified. The first con- 
cerns the scope and size of the program itself. 
It is possible that the organization required 
to deliver and maintain this program is seen 
as a task too large to handle. There is, admit- 
tedly, some reality to this concern. The alter- 
native explanation is a much more difficult 
and onerous one. Different disciplinary or 
professional groups may have a sense of in- 
vestment or ownership in being the desig- 
nated agents of suicide prevention. They 
would have much difficulty accepting or sup- 
porting a program which aims to develop the 
same baseline of competencies in all 
caregivers. This limitation broaches the 
larger question of the relationship between 
the many different professions, institutions, 
and agencies which affirm some interest and 
investment in the issues of suicide preven- 
tion. 

SUMMARY 

1. Persons-at-risk for suicidal behaviors con- 
tinue to ask for help. Their caregivers of 
all disciplines and levels of expertise need 
and want to improve their abilities as suc- 
cessful agents of suicide prevention. 

2. Intervening in an episode during the 
prelude to suicidal behavior deploys 
caregiver resources at a focused point of 
potentially great impact. The process of 



235 



3-221 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



intervention can be modelled and under- 
stood by assuming that a helping caregiver 
and person-at-risk are identifiable roles. 
Effective intervention is possible for any 
caregiver competent in the tasks of the 
gatekeeping role: recognition, risk-rating, 
and resource referral. 

3. Training opportunities to develop these 
competencies are available, but many 
learning experiences are too limited in 
their content or their intended audience. 
The Foundation Workshop offers a model 
program for the development of basic in- 
tervention competencies that has been 
successfully presented to more than 4000 
caregivers. 

4. The successful experience of the car- 
diopuhnonary resuscitation program can 
be adapted to deliver a training experience 
that enhances skills in suicide intervention 
to large numbers of different caregivers. 
The basic requirement for large-scale 
delivery invoh^es the availability of an ade- 
quate number of certified trainers. Al- 
though a rigorous Training for Trainers 
experience produces trainers who are 
committed to and invested in the 
workshop ocperience, the need for active 
sponsors to develop and maintain the net- 
work that organizes and monitors program 
delivery remains an unresolved problem. 

CONCLUSION 

The need for innovative training and educa- 
tion programs directed to caregivers active in 
suicide prevention has repeatedly been 
recognized and recommended. Our ex- 
periences in the development and delivery of 
the Foundation Workshop afford a success- 
ful model of one such program. With ap- 
propriate support, a large-scale training 
program for caregivers that ensures their 
basic competencies in suicide intervention is 
a rational and workable suicide prevention 
strategy.

THE SAMARITANS AND THE PREVENTION OF YOUTH 
SUICIDE 



Richard G. Katzoff, M.S., Treasurer, Samaritans USA, W.Alton Jones Campus, The University 
of Rhode Island, West Greenwich, Rhode Island 



SUMMARY 

Samaritans U.S.A. is a network of 14 branch 
hotlines in the eastern United States bound 
together by a common set of principles and 
practices. The primary purpose of the 
branches is to provide a 24-hour crisis line for 
the lonely, despairing, and suicidal, employ- 
ing a method called 'liefriending". 

Seven branches have outreach programs for 
intervention and prevention of youth suicide. 
Two exciting new models have been 
developed by Samaritans branches in Boston, 
Massachusetts and Providence, Rhode Is- 
land. 

In Boston, the Samaritans are implementing 
a special hotline staffed by trained teenagers 
called "Samariteens." 

In Rhode Island, the Samaritans have 
developed a suicide awareness curriculum to 
be taught by high school teachers that has 
recently been made part of the required high 
school curriculum Statewide. 

INTRODUCTION 

To understand the Samaritans and their role 
in the prevention of youth suicide, one must 
first understand the Samaritans themselves. 
Founded in 1953 in Great Britain by Chad 
Varah, the Samaritans now have 275 
branches worldwide-180 branches and more 
than 22,000 volunteers in Great Britain 
alone. In the United States there are 14 



branches with more than 700 volunteers. 

The Samaritans represent a unique approach 
to the prevention of suicide. Samaritans 
branches are non-professional services 
which offer "befriending" rather than coun- 
seling. While the Samaritans have the back- 
up services of professional counselors and 
consultants, the telephones are always 
answered by volunteers who have been care- 
fully chosen for their ability to make an 
equal-level relationship, to listen, and to 
befriend the troubled person without offer- 
ing judgments, unwanted advice, or un- 
solicited intervention. The Samaritans do 
not trace calls or take any other unrequested 
action, thus insuring that the service is com- 
pletely confidential. 

HISTORY 

This model differs in some ways from most 
other suicide prevention agencies in the 
United States. To appre ;iate the Samaritans 
commitment to confidentiality and befriend- 
ing, it is useful to understand the history of 
the Samaritans movement and the develop- 
ment of befriending as an approach to the 
prevention of suicide. 

In 1935, Chad Varah 's first duty after ordina- 
tion as an Anglican priest was to officiate at 
the burial of a fourteen year old girl who 
killed herself when her menstruation started, 
not understanding menstruation and having

no one to ask. Moved by this experience, 
Varah began to counsel his parishioners 
about human sexuality. Soon he developed 
a reputation as a sex therapist and clients 
sought him out in great numbers-many of 
them suicidal. Over the years, he was mov ed 
to expand his ministry and his counseling ac- 
tivities to include outreach to the suicidal. 

On the first of November 1953, Varah 
opened both a telephone a ad walk-in coun- 
seling service for the suicidal at St St^'phen 
Walbrook. Within a short period ot time, 
both the number of callers and the number 
of people coming in for counseling far ex- 
ceeded Varah's ability to respond. Publicity 
for Varah's services had attracted not only 
people in need of help but also a large num- 
ber of people who felt they could give help. 
While some of these people offering assis- 
tance were professionals, most were ordinary 
people and instinctively Varah began to in- 
volve these volunteers in his work. These 
people did not see themselves as counseling 
the suicidal but merely as helpers who could 
pour tea or lend an ear to others as they 
waited for Varah. In just a few weeks, Varah 
began to notice that the number of people he 
was seeing personally began to diminish; 
those who did come to him for counseling 
were easier to help because of the time they 
had spent with the volunteers. He also noted 
that the people he was seeing were rightly 
judged to be in need of the kind of profes- 
sional attention the volunteers could not 
give. This fascinated him and he began to try 
to discover what the volunteers were doing 
and why was it so successful. 

By both interviewing and observing the 
volunteers he realized that they were provid- 
ing a new kind of listening therapy. They 
provided an ear, but not advice. They 
provided sympathy and love, but no judg- 
ments. They avoided discussions of religion 
and God and just listened to what a caller or 
visitor had to say. They were "befriending." 

Befriending, as developed by Chad Varah's 
experience with these volunteers became his 
new work. He met with the volunteers 
regularly, recruited and screened new volun- 



teers, and dismissed volunteers whom he 
thought were not providing "befriending". 
The name Samaritans came out cf a headline 
describing Varah as the "Samaritan Priest"- 
a compliment passed on and ascribed to 
the volunteers. For the next five years, 
Varah experimented with and perfected the 
Samaritans' particular approach to the 
suicidal and in 1959 he began to support and 
encourage the development of other 
branches in Great Britain. In 1960, the ap- 
proach went worldwide as Samaritans 
opened new branches in Hong Kong and 
Bombay. 

Samaritans are "...themselves and what they 
have to give-namely, their personal concern, 
their time, attention and friendship. The 
Samaritan listens, accepts, cares; and this can 
make all the difference for those who feel 
that no one has time for them, that they ate 
rejected, and that nobody cares" (1). This 
simple statement by Chad Varah describes 
the heart of the Samaritims movement and 
why the approach of befriending spread so 
quickly and so far. 

In 1974, the Samaritans movement was 
brought to the United States by Monica 
Dickens who founded the first U.S. branch, 
the Samaritans of Boston. The second U.S. 
branch, the Samaritans on Cape Cod, initial- 
ly shared a board with the Boston Samaritans. 
In 1980, Samaritans USA was incorporated 
to set standards for new branches, to support 
the development of new branches in the 
United States and to fundraise for the 
Samaritans on a national scale. 

PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES 

The Seven Principles and Practices, as 
agreed upon by the Council of Management 
at its meetings in June and November 1981, 
are the standards by which Samaritans 
branches operate in the United States and 
worldwide. They are: 

Seven Principles 

1. The primary aim of the Samaritans is to be 
available at any hour of the day or night to 



3-225 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



befriend those passing through personal 
crises and in imminent danger of taking 
their own lives. 

2. The Samaritans seek to alleviate human 
misery, loneliness, despair, and depression 
by listening tC' and befriending those wl^o 
feel that they have no one else to turn to 
who would understand and accept them. 

3. A caller does not lose the freedom to make 
his/her own decisions, including the 
decision to take his/her own life, and is free 
to break contact at any time. 

4. When a person asks help of the 
Samaritans, the person's identity and 
everything he/she has said is completely 
conddential within the organization un- 
less permission is freely given by the caller 
for all or part of such information to be 
communicated to someone outside the or- 
ganization. A Samaritan volunteer is not 
permitted to accept confidences if a con- 
dition is made that not even the Director 
should be informed of them. 

5. Samaritan volunteers, in befriending 
callers, will be guided and actively sup- 
ported by experienced leaders who will 
have the advice, when required, of profes- 
sional consultants. 

6. In appropriate cases the caller will be in- 
vited to consider seeking professional help 
in such fields as medicine and social work, 
and material help from other agencies. 

7. Samaritan volunteers are forbidden to im- 
pose their own convictions or to influence 
callers in regard to politics, philosophy, or 
religion. 

Seven Practices 

1. Samaritan volunteers are carefully 
selected and prepared by the local branch 
in which they are to serve. 

2. The Samaritans are available at all hours 
to callers, and may be contacted 
(anonymously if desired) by telephone or 
personal visit, or by letter. 

3. When a caller is believed to be in danger 



of suicidal action, the Samaritan is par- 
ticularly encouraged to ask the caller's 
permission to maintain contact during the 
crisis. 

4. Samaritans offer longer-term befriending 
of callers where appropriate, while recog- 
nizing that the Branch may, from time to 
time, have to set limits. 

5. Samaritans listen to 'those concerned 
about the welfare of another person, and, 
if satisfied that the third peison is despair- 
ing, depressed, or suicidal, may discreetly 
offer befriending. 

6. Samaritans are normally known to callers 
only by a forename and contacts by callers 
maybe made only through the branch cen- 
ter. 

7. Samaritan branches are banded together 
in a legally constituted association whose 
Council of Management represents all the 
branches and reserves to itself the ap- 
pointment of the person in charge of each 
branch (2). 

While the primary purpose of all Samaritans 
branches is to provide a 24-hour crisis line for 
the lonely, despairing, and suicidal, almost all 
the branches have outreach programs per- 
taining to suicide and its prevention. Like 
many other suicide prevention agencies, the 
Samaritans have been involved in the schools 
as their primary outreach-speaking to clas- 
ses and assemblies, holding workshops for 
parents and educators, and befriending sur- 
vivors after a suicide has taken place. While 
the principles and practices remain constant 
throughout the Samaritans branches in the 
United States, the outreach programs of the 
various branches differ greatly. 

SAMARITANS OF BOSTON 

The oldest of the Samaritans branches in the 
United States, in operation since 1974, the 
Samar tans of Boston receive almost 250 calls 
or visits daily. Noticeably more and more of 
these callers are young people who are 
seriously depressed or suicidal. Since 1982, 
the Samaritans of Boston have focused spe- 



3-226 



R.Katzoff: The Samaritans and Prevention of Youth Suicide 



cial attention on the problem of teenage 
suicide through their Youth Outreach 
Project. 

In&lcad of waiting for young people to call or 
visit, the Samaritans focused i^heir efforts on 
prevention through education. They 
thoroughly researched the extent of the 
problem in Massachusetts and designed 
educational maverials based on the result" of 
that research. They began their outreach by 
distributing their pamphlets to all schools 
and colleges in the State of Ma<:sachusetts. 
They followed this with an offer to provide a 
speaker for any clabs or staff group that was 
interested. 

Both the oral and the written information 
was divided into two sections one for the stu- 
dents themselves and one for teachers and 
counselors working with those students. For 
the professionals, the booklet, "Teens: 
Depression and Suicide\ delineated the 
problem, identified warning signs of depres- 
sion anu suicide risk in children, offered sug- 
gestions on how to help, and provided 
information on where to go for help. The in- 
formation is presented in a clear and direct 
manner, viz.: 

Parents, teachers, and friends of depres.'>ed 
or suicidal young people often ask the 
Samaritans what they can do to help. '^The im- 
portant thing is to pay attention. Encourage 
them to talk. Listen. Be on their side. Reas- 
sure without dismissing. 

Don't panic. Remember that no one is 
suicidal all the time. Thoughts of self 
destruction arise at times of crises, but lives 
can be saved by understanding and support. 

Learn to recognize the signs of serious 
depression and suicide risk. Eight out of 
ten suicides give definite warnings, ver- 
bal or behavioral, of their inten- 
tions.. .These signs of depression do not 
invariably mean that young people are 
coiitemplating suicide, but they alert you 
to the need to explore more carefully 
their state of mind.... 

Don't be afraid to ask, "Do you some- 



times feel so bad you think of suicide?" 
....Discussing suicide openly is one of the 
most helpful things you can <uO. It shows 
that you are taking the person seriously, 
and that you care. 

If the answer is "yes," follow through by 
asking, "Have you thought about how 
you .night do it?"....It is vital not to under- 
estimate the danger by not r'-king for 
details. 

If you think there is immediate danger, 
DO NOT LEA^E THE PERSON 
ALONE. Stay with him until the crisis 
passes or help arrives....The Samaritans 
are always available to help you or the 
person in danger.... 

If the person is hallucinating, affected by 
drugs or alcohol, if an ::ttempt has begun 
or is imminent, do not try to go it alone. 
Stay with the person, and contact any of 
the following: an ambulance senice in 
your town, your local police, emergency 
room of a local hospital, a trusted adult, 
the Samaritans (3). 

The Samaritans also designed pamphlets 
geared to young people themselves, offering 
much of the same information in an easily un- 
derstandable style. These pamphlets include 
the warning signs of depression and suicide 
risk but are presented in question form. 
Myths and facts about suicide are also in- 
cluded, places to turn for help and guidelines 
for handling an emergency. 

The Youth Outreach Project of the 
Samaritans of Boston has been a tremendous 
success. Now coordinated by a full-time per- 
son, the materials described above have been 
mailed annually since 1982 to 1500 schools 
and colleges. In addition, Samaritans have 
given more than 500 talks on the subject of 
teenage suicide and have followed-up on 
more than 2500 requests for additional infor- 
mation. The number of teenagers contacting 
the Samaritans of Boston has increased over 
the life of the program from 10.8 percent of 
the total client volume in 1982 to 16.6 per- 
cent in 1985 (4).

Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



In 198S, the program was expanded to in- 
clude information on the relationship of al- 
cohol to youth suicide. Two pamphlets, one 
oriented to teenagers and the other to their 
parents, were published in 198S, both en- 
titled, "Drinking and the Teenager." 

In 1986, the Youth Outreach Project of the 
Samaritans of Boston made an additional 
commitment to the prevention of adolescent 
suicide through the creation of a special and 
dieparate telephone hotline for teenagers, 
staffed by teenagers themselves who are 
caUed SAMARITEENS. 

SAMARITANS ON CAPE COD 

The Samaritans have developed multiple 
relationships with the schools in Cape Cod, 
Massachusetts. They have provided 
workshops for teachers, both for credit and 
not for credit, on befriending and suicide 
awareness. They also make presentations to 
student groups and church youth groups, 
usually about once a month that often in- 
clude a screening of the film, "Urgent Mes- 
sages." They are often called into a school 
after a suicide to provide postvention ser- 
vices. 

In addition, this group consults with an active 
chapter of Students Against Drunk Driving 
(S.A.D.D.), a relationship that not only sup- 
ports the activities of that organization, but 
provides access and legitimacy for the 
Samaritans among a large population of stu- 
dents. 

SAMARITANS OF RHODE 
ISLAND 

The unique small size of Rhode Island is con- 
ducive to Statewide activities and interven- 
tions. The Providence branch of the 
Samaritans serves the whole State of Rhode 
Island, both in its telephone service as well as 
its outreach programs. In 1985, the Rhode 
Island Samaritans conducted almost 200 
suicide information seminars in the school- 
rooms of Rhode Island. Realizing that this 
approach only began to meet the need that 




3-228 



existed in the schools, the Samaritans of 
Rhode Island began work on a model that 
would institutionalize the teaching of suicide 
awareness Statewide in the schools. 

Merely believing that the education of stu- 
dents in the classroom is an effective tool in 
suicide awareness and prevention is not 
enough to gamer the kind of support neces- 
sary to implement a new Statewide program. 
With an issue as emotional as adolescent 
suicide, documentation and evaluation are 
necessities. 

The Samaritans of Rhode Island first 
developed a manual to be used in the teach- 
ing of suicide awareness in the classroom. 
The author of the manual, George J. Fincik, 
is both a Samaritan and a secondaiy school 
English teacher. The manual consists of five 
lessons: 

1. Developing a compassionate attitude 
toward suicide and its victims. 

2. Acquiring knowledge about suicide. 

3. Developing an awareness of the signs sig- 
nalling suicide. 

4. Developing befriending skills. 

5. Building a support system. 

Through these five lessons the manual in- 
tends to focus the attention of the teaching 
community on adolescent suicide, to involve 
teachers in a realistic way in suicide preven- 
tion, and to introduce befriending as a skill 
and approach. Fincik, in his introduction to 
the manual, states this intent most eloquent- 
ly: 

We can no longer perceive our roles only 
as dispensers of knowledge. The stu- 
dents sitting in front of us are not mere 
receptacles for ideas^ facts, values, 
trends, data, or events. Those sitting in 
front of us are caught up in the pressure* 
cooker of modern life. These human 
beings are sometimes seething with feel- 
ings that are incomprehensible, with a 
sense of helplessness, hopelessnes6 and 
futurelessness that is emotionally 
debilitating, with ideas that confuse 

2i2

rather than clarify, and with demands 
that would defy a Hercules. Such human 
beings are hardly in a condition to take 
our classroom activities seriously. 

And who but teachers are in the best 
position to observe students individually 
or in groups, to sense the emotions seeth- 
ing under the surface, to monitor subtle 
changes in behavior, and to realize that 
the student in reality might be a hurting 
human being? 

But if the teacher lacks knowledge about 
suicide-its causes and its warning signs- 
the teacher very well could be unaware 
that a life and death drama might be 
developing. It is too late to rewrite the 
lesson plans of life once the student rips 
up the original copy (S). 

With the help of a grant from the National 
Conference of State Legislatures, the 
Samaritans of Rhode Island embarked on a 
pilot program to assess the effectiveness of 
the manual and its awareness program in four 
Rhode Island schools. Four corresponding, 
non-participating schools were used as con- 
trols. Both the experimental schools as well 
as the control schools rep; ssented a sampling 
of teenagers in the State: urban, suburban, 
rural and suburban/rural mixed. 

In October 1985, baseline data were col- 
lected at all eight schools. Following that, the 
Samaritans held a two day workshop for the 
participating teachers from the four ex- 
perimental pilot schools. Four sessions were 
developed by the Samaritans to help the 
teachers confront their feelings and attitudes 
about suicide and to inform them further 
about youth suicide. The sessions were: 

1. Suicide information, statistics, studies, and 
programs. 

2. Attitudes toward death and suicide. 

3. Befriending: the art of active listening. 

4. The manual, crisis intervention protocol, 
and school protocols. 

Samaritans staff reported that teachers par- 
ticipating in these sessions were extremely 



positive in their evaluations, and felt more 
skilled and knowledgeable. Following this 
training, the teachers implemented the cur- 
riculum model from the manual. 

FoUowup assessments were done at all eight 
schools with four different measures 
employed as assessment tools: knowledge 
about suicide, student attitudes toward 
suicide, personal knowledge of suicide, and 
feelings of hopelessness. 

The pilot program based on both participant 
evaluation and ex.ernal evaluation was con- 
sidered a success. 

The Samaritans, in collaboration with the 
Rhode Island Department of Education, the 
Rhode Island Department of Health, and the 
Rhode Island Task Force on Adolescent 
Suicide Prevention developed a plan to en- 
sure that this model was implemented 
Statewide. The Rhode Island Department 
of Education has incorporated suicide 
prevention into their mandatory health cur- 
riculum. In conjunction with Rhode Island 
College, the Samaritans will o^er a two credit 
graduate course in suicide education so that 
teachers can learn the new mandated cur- 
riculum. The Rhode Island Department of 
Health has set an internal objective for 1990 
that states "...that greater than 60 percent of 
young people, ages 15 through 24, should 
identify a suicide prevention hotline." And 
the State legislature through a bill introduced 
on behalf of the Task Force on Adolescent 
Suicide Prevention, has made an appropria- 
tion of $35,000 to the Samaritans of Rhode 
Island to coordinate the implementation of 
the Statewide suicide curriculum through the 
continued refinement of the manual and the 
training of health teachers Statewide in its 
use. 

The preliminary results of the Samaritans of 
Rhode Island study were presented at the 
American Association of Suicidology meet- 
ing in April 1986 and will appear in the 
Rhode Island Journal of Medicine in Sep- 
tember 1986. A followup study Is scheduled 
for June 1986.

Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



SAMARITANS OF THE 
MERRIMACK VALLEY 

Located in Lawrence, Massachusetts, the 
Samaritans of the Merrimack Valley in- 
tegrate their outreach efforts with the efforts 
of other agencies in the Merrimack Valley. 
They consult with a high school peer coun- 
seling project, "The Connection," that 
produces an improvisational theater 
program on adolescent suicide. They par- 
ticipate in the Town of Andover's Assess- 
ment-Support-Knowledge (A.S.K.) 
Program, providing wallet cards with hotline 
numbers to all the school children in the area 
as well as integrated and coordinated preven- 
tion and intervention programs. 

Their outreach efforts also include visits to 
20 to 25 schools in the Lawrence/Haver- 
hill/Lowell area, direct mailings of suicide re- 
lated articles, showings of the video Teen 
Suicide- What Can We Do?", and postven- 
tion services to communities that have ex- 
perienced a suicide. 

SAMARITANS IN KEENE 

Like all Samaritans branches, the Samaritans 
in Keene, New Hampshire, reach out to the 
schools, youth groups, and colleges in their 
area with brochures and offer to present on- 
site programs. Last year the presented al- 
most 35 programs to groups of young people. 

The Keene Samaritans are also taking ad- 
vantage of the experiences of other 
Samaritans branches in the United States, 
both in their current efforts as well as in their 
plans for new outreach activities and 
program-;. They currently distribute a 
brochure entitled "Suicide Prevention~A 
Guide for Students" developed by the 
Samaritans of Rhode Island. In addition they 
are in the process of writing a grant proposal 
that would fund both a Samariteens line such 
as that developed by the Boston branch as 
well as an improvisational youth theatre 
group similar to the one supported by the 
Merrimack Valley branch. 



SAMARITANS OF SOUTH 
MIDDLESEX 

Serving the Framingham, Massachusetts 
area, the Samaritans of South Middlesex 
direct-mail a brochure to all schools in their 
locale. Similar to the other Samaritan 
branches, they offer a followup visit includ- 
ing a showing of the film "Urgent Message." 
One unique aspect of the outreach of the 
Samaritans of South Middlesex is that they 
emphasize to their young audiences that they 
can call collect. This, the Samaritans believe, 
encourages more young people to use the 
service who might otherwise fear the 
Samaritans number appearing on the 
parents' telephone bill. 

SAMARITANS OF FALL 
RIVER/NEW BEDFORD 

The Samaritans of Fall River/New Bedford is 
the newest full branch in the Samaritans 
USA network, having opened in the spring 
of 1984. Similar to the other fiill branches of 
the Samaritans, the Fall River/New Bedford 
group has reached out beyond the hotline 
and walk-in service to the schools and col- 
leges in its area. Two schools have 
videotaped the Samaritans' presentation and 
copies are available in their school libraries 
whenever anyone wants to see them. 

In addition, the Samaritans have been invited 
to produce and plan a workshop on 
"befriending" for all guidance counselors in 
the Fall River, Massachusetts system. The 
Fall River/New P^ford Samaritans are par- 
ticularly interested in sharing the model of 
befriending-acceptance without judgment- 
with key professional people in tht. schools. 

OTHER BRANCHES 

The other seven branches that currently 
make up Samaritans USA are considered 
either probationary or prep'^ratory branches, 
still working at meeting all the guidelines and 
standards for full status. Located in Chicago, 
New York City, Albany, Hartford, 
Washington, D.C., the South Shore of Mas-

sachusetts, and South Central New 
Hampshire, these branches are focusiing on 
providing 24 hour befriending services to 
their areas. Major outreach activities by 
Samaritan branches are prohibited prior to 
attaining full status. 

Samaritans USA is still a relative newcomer 
to the field of youth suicide prevention in the 
United States. Until recently located 
primarily in New England, Samaritan 
branches are now opening in a wider 
geographical area as indicated in the list of 
probationary and preparatory branches. 

As the number of branches spreads 
throughout the United States, so does the im- 
pact of the Samaritans approach to youth 
suicide. The Samariteens program in Boston 
and the suicide awareness curriculum in 
Rhode Island are quite possibly models for 
the entire country. And the heart of the 
Samaritans, befriending, is an approach that 
has worked and is working worldwide.

EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT OF SUICIDAL RISK 
IN CHEMICALLY DEPENDENT ADOLESCENTS 

John E. Meeks, M,D., Medical Director, Psychiatric Institute of Montgomery County, 
RockvUle, Maryland 



SUMMARY 

The chemically dependent youngster who 
becomes suicidal appears to be characterized 
by a strong family history of chemical abuse, 
obvious signs of depression and hopeless- 
ness, a stated desire to die, and a recent loss 
or separation, most commonly, parental 
separation or divorce. 

Recognizing the crisis and providing care and 
protection is the most crucial aspect of the 
prevention of suicide in these cases. 
However, the underlying illness is chronic 
and requires long term treatment with con- 
tinued alertness to the possibility of a recur- 
rence of suicidal risk. 

INTRODUCTION 

The correlation between heavy drug use and 
suicidal behavior is evident to a wide range of 
clinicians (1,6,7,9). According to Frances 
(4), half of all suicides are associated with al- 
cohol use. In recent years, large scale studies 
of mortality in psychiatric patients show that 
a history of alcoholism or drug dependency 
greatly increases the likelihood of untimely 
death among both psychiatric outpatients 
and inpatients (1,6). Much of the increased 
mortality in these patients can be attributed 
to suicide. Recent studies of adolescent 
populations have confirmed these trends in 
young people, a flnding that does not surprise 
therapists who treat adolescents and are 
familiar with this phenomenon in their clini- 



cal practices. 

The strong relationship between severe 
depressive illness and suicidal behavior has 
also been widely recognized (7,8,9). A high 
rate of depressive symptomatology is also ob- 
vious in chemically dependent patients. In- 
deed, Robins and Alessi (9) have theorized 
that drug abusing depressives are a special 
subpopulation with an exquisite sensitivity to 
dysphoric affects and a veiy limited capacity 
to tolerate them. Thus th^ would be more 
likely to use chemicals in an effort to 
ameliorate depression and more likely to be 
tempted to turn to suicide as a permanent 
solution to their painful state. In spite of 
considerable interest and research, however, 
the relationship between the syndromes of 
depression and the syndromes of addiction is 
not completely clear. For example, recent 
literature suggests that addictive behavior 
and the depressive syndromes are two 
separate illnesses with some degree of over- 
lap. It is also clear that a great deal of depres- 
sion encountered in chemically dependent 
individuals is a result of addiction rather than 
its cause (2,5,10). 

Many elements of the addictive experience 
increase the likelihood of depression with at- 
tendant feelings of helplessness, despair, and 
suicidality. These factors are enhanced in 
adolescents because of the young person's 
relative lack of a time perspective, the ten-

dency to be action oriented, and the 
heightened impulsiveness characteristic of 
immaturity. 

Even if drug-using, depressed adolescents do 
not represent a specific high risk population 
as suggested by Robins and Alessi, mai^, al- 
most inevitable effects of habitual drug use 
increase the likelihood of suicidal behavior. 
As mentioned earlier, mai^ of the drugs 
themselves produce central nervous system 
depression which is often accompanied by 
subjective dysphoria. Alcohol, for example, 
is notorious for producing a morose and ir- 
ritable mental state when the blood alcohol 
level begins to diminish. Other drugs 
produce a depressive frame of mind on 
withdrawal, particularly cocaine (5). 

Most of the depression produced by chemi- 
cal dependency, however, results from its im- 
pact on overadl life style. The inability to 
control one's actions creates a sense of help- 
lessness and demoralization. In addition, the 
adolescent heavily involved with drugs amas- 
ses a constantly increasing load of guilt. This 
guilt is related to alienation from family and 
other responsible adults, accumulating 
failures and disloyalties, and personally unac- 
ceptable behaviors which the adolescent had 
to perform in order to get drugs, or did them 
because his/her judgment and self control 
were impaired by intoxication. This increas- 
ingly heavy mental baggage of regret and 
remorse is held just out of consciousness by 
denial, projection, minimalization, and 
heavier use of drugs. It looms behind the 
adolescent as a monstrous shadow, however, 
ever growing and ever closer to overwhelm- 
ing the youngster's self-esteem and pleasure 
in life. 

The problems produced by a lifestyle of 
heavy drug use are accentuated during times 
of withdrawal because of the physiological 
depression and irritability which accompany 
the process of detoxiHcation from many of 
the psychoactive drugs. The withdrawal 
from cocaine is frequently accompanied by 
suicidal ruminations (S), although actual 
suicidal behavior has not been as frequently 
reported during withdrawal as it has been 



during the state of intoxication itself. For ex- 
ample, many alcoholics who commit suicide 
are discovered to have high blood alcohol 
readings at death. 

There is considerable agreement that 
suicidal behavior in drug-involved individuals 
is frequently triggered oj experiences of loss. 
Very often these losses are the direct result 
of drug use. For example, the patient may get 
into serious legal trouble, face major disrup- 
tions of family life, be dropped from an ath- 
letic team or experience some other loss or 
life failure clearly resulting from drug use. 
On the other hand, these individuals seem to 
be vulnerable to losses that are unrelated to 
the drug problem, such as the death of a 
parent or geographic move which disrupts 
support networks. It is as though the chemi- 
cally dependent individual is more likely to 
experience loss than the average person, but 
may also be less able to deal with the 
psychological consequences of loss experien- 
ces. 

CLINICAL PROFILE OF HIGH 
RISK ADOLESCENTS 

Evidence of Depression 

According to Robins and Alessi (9) the most 
accurate indicator of the likelihood of a 
serious suicide attempt is the adolescents' 
stated sense of hopelessness and a definite 
statement that they "wish to die." The 
author's clinical exp>eriencG supports the ob- 
servation that this information is best ob- 
tained in an individual interview with the 
adolescent which should include empathic 
listening and very direct and persistent ques- 
tioning regarding the adolescent's true feel- 
ings. 

Diane was a 17-year old girl with a history 
of periodic rage outbursts, periods of 
depression, marijuana, alcohol and 
cocaine abuse, and difficulty in making 
and keeping friends. She was hospital- 
ized following a suicide threat which wis 
judged to be serious although it was not 
accompanied by any attempt. The 
patient had a stormy early hospital cx-

Report of the Secretary*s Task Force on Youth Suicide 



perience but was gradually able to discuss 
her feelings about her mother's death by 
suicide and her own difficulty in main- 
taining a positive mood. She improved 
and was discharged to her home. Con- 
tinuing outpatient individual and group 
psychotherapy aftercare helped Diane 
maintain an adequate adjustment in her 
adoptive family until the adoptive 
father's work required a geographic 
move. 

Although Diane was placed in 
psychotherapy in the new location and 
seemed to be making an adequate adjust- 
/ ment, she called a friend in her old neigh- 
borhood and complained that she was 
not able to make close friends in the new 
location and that she had begun to use 
cocaine again. A week later she called 
another friend stating enigmatically that 
she "just wanted to hear her voice". A 
week later she overdosed on her an- 
tidepressant medication and died. 

This tragic case reminds us that adolescents 
often offer meager clues which th^ expect 
us to perceive and actively pursue. Unfor- 
tunately, as in the case of Diane, these clues 
are often very confusing. Diane's friends 
were touched by her telephone calls and 
since they saw mainly the somewhat abrasive, 
behaviorally disordered facade which Diane 
used to protect herself from being hurt in de- 
pendency relationships, they simply did not 
recognize the warning. It is unknown 
whether Diane provided any warning to her 
new therapist. It is very likely that no clues 
were ofiTered although Diane had lived in the 
new location for more than six months. 

Diane's depression, substance abuse, and 
death also illustrate other important risk fac- 
tors. As previously mentioned, her mother 
was a suicide victim. The mother committed 
suicide on a holiday evening during Diane's 
seventh year. Diane herself committed 
suicide within a week after that time ten years 
later. At the time of her hospitalization the 
psychologist who tested Diane noted, 
"thoughts of death are often on her mind." 
Diane also showed a pervasive difficulty in 



forming and maintaining comfortable de- 
• pendent relationships. She had a mild learn- 
ing disorder which interfered with her 
effective functioning in school in spite of a 
tested I.Q. in the superior range. All of these 
factors contributed to her reputation as a 
troublemaker and smart-aleck. They also 
disguised to some extent her hunger for ac- 
ceptance and affection. Finally, the 
geographic move with its disruption of 
Diane's therapy and friendship relationships 
probably contributed to her sense of loss and 
triggered the overwhelming sense of hope- 
lessness and depression that led to her 
suicide. 

A second brief case vignette offers addition- 
al examples of the same risk factors. 

Dawn, a 14-year old Giucasian female, 
was raped by a girlfriend's father at a 
slumber party one year prior to admis- 
sion. Because of the complex set of cir- 
cumstances which probably included 
some poor legal advice, no action v * 
taken against the rapist. P' «vn 
responded to the event with severe 
psychological problems. She became 
very rebellious at home, slept excessive- 
ly, lost about 20 pounds and appeared to 
lose interest in all of her previous ac- 
tivities, including her school work. She 
began to act out sexually, caught gonor- 
rhea, became pregnant, and had an abor- 
tion. She also began to use drugs heavily, 
particularly marijuana and cocaine, and 
started running away from home for 
prolonged periods. Her depression only 
became clearly evident, however, when 
her parents separated and began plan- 
ning for a divorce two months prior to her 
admission. When her mother told her of 
their plans. Dawn became profoundly 
depressed and made a very serious 
suicide attempt, taking all the medica- 
tions she could find in the family 
medicine cabinet. She was hospitalized 
in a coma and transferred for psychiatric 
treatment when medically cleared. At 
the time of hospitalization, she appeared 
less depressed and was demonstrating

some of her previous defensive 
measures. Psychological testing 
reported defenses of "denial, avoidance, 
and extemalization". Psychological test- 
ing also revealed visual perceptual motor 
problems for which Dawn seemed to be 
attempting to compensate. 

CASE SURVEYS 

To provide some numerical support to anec- 
dotal clinical impressions, the last nine 
youngsters admitted for serious suicide at- 
tempts who also reported drug abuse, were 
reviewed. Certain features are interesting, 
although is is obvious that we cannot draw 
definite conclusions from such a small group 
or even state which hypotheses might best ex- 
plain the case characteristics. 

Two findings are extremely striking. A clear 
history of alcoholism within a family member 
(no more distant than uncle or grandparent) 
existed in eight of the nine youngsters (five 
girls and four boys). Three fathers, one 
mother, and four other close family members 
(two grandfathers and two uncles) had docu- 
mented alcoholism. In some cases, several 
family members were known to be alcoholic. 

The second striking finding was that a separa- 
tion or divorce had occurred within the pre- 
vious two years in six of the nine cases. In two 
other cases, the probability of separation was 
being openly discussed by the parents at the 
time of hospitalization. 

A history of a suicide attempt or completed 
suicide was noted in a family member in only 
two of the nine cases and only three cases had 
recently experienced a geographical move. 
Four of the youngsters had evidence of 
primary learning disability through both his- 
tory and psychological testing. 

It is difficult to say exactly what these obser- 
vations mean, but they suggest that the 
population is a highly vulnerable one. There 
is a major hereditary susceptibility for sub- 
stance abuse. Central nervous system dys- 
function or instability demonstrated through 
the presence of learning disabilities was also 



evident in four of the youngsters and a fifth 
had a seizure disorder. Perhaps these vul- 
nerabilities, coupled with problems created 
by drug abuse help to explain the youngster's 
difficulty in maintaining self-esteem and the 
ease with which th^ could develop a sense 
of helplessness and hopelessness that might 
make suicide attractive to them. Often, de- 
pendency relationships which might have 
supported the vulnerable youngsters were 
tenuous, particularly within their families 
and, as we have seen in several cases, these 
tenuous support systems were further dis- 
rupted by marital disharmony or separation. 

Perhaps the subjective sense of their lives is 
better conveyed by Marti, a 15-year old girl 
who wrote in an English essay, in the 
hospital's school, 

"Why can't I love anyone? Why can't 
I care about myself? Why can't I 
keep friends? Why do I hurt people 
all the time? Why can't I be 
straight? I can't think of any solu- 
tions. All (I) can think about is the 
questions and the problems that face 
me." 

The psychologist described Marti as "an ex- 
ceedingly discouraged person who sees her- 
self as undergoing a great deal of suffering 
and torment.... The depressed feelings that 
Marti has are compounded by family 
problems.... This combination leads Marti to 
feel quite hopeless about things and there are 
signs that acting on suicidal feelings presents 
a continuing threat in her case.... Marti feels 
quite abandoned by other people." 

Sometimes this sense of abandonment simp- 
ly reflects reality. Sean, a 15-year old white 
male with a history of bedwetting until age 
11, played with matches as a child, and was 
generally destructive. He was completely 
rejected by both of his divorced parents. The 
mother refused to take custody. The father 
hospitalized Sean after a serious suicide at- 
tempt but rejected the recommendation for 
long-term residential treatment or for out- 
patient treatment since he felt Sean did not 
deserve "to have another penny spent on his 




2 in

Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



meanness." He stated instead, that it was his 
intention to take him home, let him decom- 
pensate and then "turn him over to the 
authorities." On psychological testing Sean 
"painted a picture of a sordid, morally barren 
world, in which even loved ones cannot be 
trusted." 

MANAGEMENT OF THE 
SUICIDAL CHEMICALLY 
DEPENDENT ADOLESCENT 

The first priority in the treatment of the 
suicidally active, chemically dependent 
adolescent is iisk identiHcation. As men- 
tioned previously, the recognition of suicidal 
risk is not difficult if the index of suspicion is 
high. The initial evaluation of all adolescents 
should include careful review of all pertinent 
suicide risk factors including the degree of 
hopelessness and stated desire for death, his- 
tory of suicidal behavior in a relative or 
friend, history of previous attempts, and the 
history of recent losses or separations. It <ip- 
pears from the limited data mentioned in the 
study of the nine cases above that parental 
separation or divorce seems to be a par- 
ticularly dangerous loss experience for this 
population of youngsters. 

Once a youngster with a high risk of suicide 
is identified, it is important to remember that 
continuing caution is indicated since most of 
the conditions which predispose the 
youngster to depression and suicidal be- 
havior are chronic. These basic vul- 
nerabilities and pathological defenses do not 
yield easily to treatment and are difficult to 
alter on a permanent basis. One can easily 
be overly optimistic about patients who are 
in treatment. The process of psychotherapy 
itself temporarily satisfies emotional and de- 
pendency needs. The experience of being 
cared for may produce behaHoral improve- 
ment which is not, however, readily internal- 
ized in the youngster's psychic structure. TTie 
fact is that these youngsters remain highly 
vulnerable to loss experiences. Any changes 
in living conditions perceived 1^ youngsters 
as traumatic can produce new suicidal peril 
for them and their apparent gains may rapid- 



ly vanish. 

At the time of acute suicidal risk, aggressive 
treatment is necessary to protect the 
youngster. One cannot expect complete 
cooperation from either the adolescent or 
the adolescent's parents in all cases. For the 
adolescent, suicide often appears as a con- 
sciously desired solution to his/her chronic 
unhappiness while parents may consciously 
or unconsciously accept this outcome also. 
In some instances, such as Sean's father, the 
parent even seems to be actively and con- 
sciously encouraging the adolescent's 
despair and sense of abandonment 

Adolescents may resist help because they are 
ambivalent about desiring death and they 
fear dependency. Often, they force helpful 
adults to prove their determination and 
genuine desire to be of assistance by making 
the therapeutic process as difficult and un- 
rewarding as possible. However, when 
provided firm, clear support of sustaining life 
and Hrm disavowal of suicide as an acceptable 
action, the adolescent will usually abandon 
suicidal efforts. At times, supervision of the 
adolescent is necessary on an almost constant 
basis to insure the youngster's safety, but as 
a rule, this kind of caution does not need to 
be extended over time. When adolescents 
are prepared to give unequivocal assurances 
that they w^.i: not harm themselves and they 
will report any suicidal urges to a responsible 
adult, the promise can usually be trusted. In 
the same way that adolescents are usually 
truthful in reporting their plan to kill them- 
selves when asked directly within a 
framework of care and concern, their 
promises that they will not harm themselves- 
-if delivered with appropriate affect to a 
trusted adult-are a reliable indicator of their 
ability and willingness to protect themselves. 

The active treatment of the concurrent 
chemical dependency is also very important 
in these cases. Continuing use of drugs un- 
dermines self-esteem and produces a sense 
of alienation from caretakers, both of which 
increase the danger of suicide. 

As a rule, traditional psychotherapy alone is 




3-236 



250 



J.Meeks: Evaluation & Management of Suicidal Risk... 



not sufficient to gain and maintain 
abstinence and control of addictive behavior 
in chemically dependent adolescents. Long- 
term traditional psychotherapy is usually 
necessary to ameliorate the psychological 
vulnerabilities which may have initiated the 
excessive dependency on drugs and also to 
help the adolescent tolerate the task of 
mastering those developmental achieve- 
ments which were disrupted by chronic in- 
toxication and the preoccupation with the 
drug life. 

In addition, special remediation and ego 
building approaches may be needed to help 
the adolescent master the environment more 
effectively and internalize a sense of com- 
petence. These ego building, cognitive 
aspects of treatment may include special 
education as well as social skills training as in- 
dicated for specific adolescents. Practical, 
sensitive assistance in gaining school and/or 
vocational successes as well as help in 
developing and maintaining a network of 
friends is also important. 

The youngster's environment should be 
evaluated also. If a neighborhood or school 
is particularly competitive, fragmented, cold, 
or unfriendly, the therapist may need to be- 
come involved in efforts to create community 
atmospheres more supportive of the fragile 
adolescent. Assistance in locating ap- 
propriate Alcoholics or Narcotics 
Anonymous support groups may be veiy im- 
portant in maintaining abstinence and in 
providing needed emotional support derived 
from group membership and group recogni- 
tion of achievement. 

Family therapy is always a necessary part of 
the treatment process. Some families are dif- 
ficult to treat. Often these youngsters have 
been a longstanding source of stress and un- 
happiness to the parents. The disturbed 
adolescent may even have been a significant 
element in the marital discord or separation 
commonly seen in these families. At the 
same time, many of the parents are chemical- 
ly dependent themselves or suffer from ego 
wealuiesses similar to those observed in the 
adolescents. The result of all these negative 



factors is that these parents often present in 
a very unappealing manner. They may be 
overtly or subtly rejecting the adolescent 
patient, contemptuous of therapy (to some 
extent because th^ have had many treat- 
ment failures), and uncooperative. At times, 
the parents appear very child-like and self- 
centered and do not hold the attitudes 
toward child-rearing which mental health 
workers would find acceptable. 

In spite of all these comments, many parents 
can be involved in therapy if they are ap- 
proached with understanding and with an ac- 
curate perception of the special needs of 
their disturbed adolescent children. It is 
usually necessary to be very firm in involving 
the parents in the treatment process. This 
may go as far as insisting that they assume 
their parental responsibilities, if necessary, 
by involving protective services and other 
legal approaches to force them to behave 
responsibly. Firm limits on acting out be- 
havior are often necessaiy. Interestingly, al- 
though this leadership is often initially 
greeted with anger, the anger does not seem 
to interfere with long-term efforts to involve 
the families in treatment. At some level, 
these adults realize that they have a parental 
responsibility and, like an acting out adoles- 
cent, to some extent they are inviting us to 
take a firm stand to demand their best pos- 
sible performance on behalf of their children. 

A complete discussion of family therapy ap- 
proaches is obviously not the purpose of this 
p? 'Cr. It should be mentioned briefly, 
however, that multi-family therapy provides 
a model in which families who have achieved 
progress in developing or regaining a suppor- 
tive parental role in their child's life can help 
new families. The "experienced" families can 
calm and support the shakier new parents 
and guide them through the treatment 
process with greater tact and with less narcis- 
sistic injury than professionals alone can 
offer. 

Didactic techniques, which include sub.stan- 
tial education regarding the addictive 
process, its depressive component, and the 
effectiveness of therapy, also can be very im-

portant in orienting the family to the nature 
of the treatment process and encouraging 
them regarding the possibilities of a positive 
outcome. 

The value of psychopharmacology in the 
treatment of these adolescents is difficult to 
evaluate generally. Some adolescents, par- 
ticularly those with a clear family history of 
major depressive illness, do seem to beneHt 
by antidepressants. These medications are a 
reasonable part of the treatment plan, par- 
ticularly in cases where treatment is begun in 
a hospital setting. It is crucial, however, not 
to expect too much of the antidepressant 
drugs, particularly in youngsters with his- 
tories that include clear cut ego defects and 
external traumas such as most of tuose we 
have described in this paper. It is important 
not to forget that the most common drug 
used in suicide attempts and successful 
suicides is the antidepressant.

INTRODUCTION AND 
OVERVIEW 

During the past five years, it has become ap- 
parent that suicidal behavior among young 
people represents an important public health 
^ problem requiring the development and im- 
plementation of detection and information 
strategies at the national policy level. Suicide 
is now the second leading cause of death in 
young people. For example, between 1970 
and 1980, 49,496 of the nation's youth, 15 to 
24 years of age committed suicide. Within 
this one decade, the suicide rate for this age 
group increased 40 percent (from 8.8 deaths 
per 100,000 population in 1970 to 12.3 per 
100,000 in 1980), while the rate for the 
remainder of the population remained 
stable. Young adults 20 to 24 years of age 
had approximately twice the number and rate 
of suicides as teenagers IS to 19 years old. 
This increase in youth suicide is due primari- 
ly to an increasing rate of suicide among 
young men. Rates for males increased by 50 
percent (from 13.5 to 20.2 per 100,000) com- 
pared to a 2 percent increase in females 
(from 4.2 to 4.3 per 100,000) between 1970 
and 1980 so that by 1980 the ratio of suicides 
committed by males to those committed by 
females in this age group was almost five to 
one. 



A first step in our review of this area is to 
define early detection. It is im^rtant to real- 
ize that completed suicide is a low-base-rate 
phenomenon in that, fortunately, it does not 
occur that frequently (1). However, this rare 
event status does not compromise our major 
objective, which is to increase our ability to 
determine who is at greatest risk for com- 
pleted suicide. We would argue that target- 
ing one's efforts to prevent successful 
suicide-that is, to detect all behavior that 
leads to a final common pathway, suicide 
completion-is best done if we understand 
the various domains through which suicidal 
behavior emerges. These domains are not 
just risk factors but spheres of vulnerability. 
Because they can be detected and manipu- 
lated, they also represent opportunities for 
intervention. 

In this review, we will attempt to describe 
several levels of detection and to integrate 
our proposed model of risk factors with a 
multi-threshold level model of detection 
(Table 1). Unfortunately, up to the present, 
reports on detection of suicide have often 
been flawed by poor methodology. 
Moreover, available detection and interven-

tion studies have not been adequately 
evaluated, nor has sufficient attention been 
given to the development of a conceptual 
model of detection and intervention. We 
believe that there are three major levels of 
detection^ 

• The first level represents the need to "red 
flag" high risk groups. It is basically a 
detection awareness strategy to follow 
individuals who may possess certain 
genetic and biological risk factors that in- 
teract with environmental factors in such 
a way that these individuals may be at risk 
for developing behavioral problems 
and/or psychiatric disorders that are 
present in Levels n and m. Level I also 
includes environmental stressors that are 
linked with suicidal behavior. 

• Level II represents the detection of 
major behavioral/environmental 
problems. Here we are dealing with 
symptomatic children and youth in whom 
assessment and intervention may be re- 
quired. Problems such as emotional dif- 
Hculties, running away from home, and 
poor self-esteem may be identified at this 
particular level. 

• Level III represents the detection of a 
psychiatric disorder of sufficient severity 
to require assessment and mtervention 
by mental health professionals. 

These three levels will be described in greater 
detail later in this review. 



Model of suicidal behavior 

Our next task is to describe the five domains 
that comprise our theoretical model of 
suicidal behavior. We believe that five 
domains organized as a matrix provide a 
simple but appropriate model for considering 
these five risk factors for clinical investiga- 
tion as well as for education and clinician in- 
tervention (Figure 1). We believe this 
overlapping model of risk, shown graphically 
as a series of interlocking Venn diagrams, 
represents a compelling alternative to no- 
tions of final common pathways or parallel 
schemas (2). A major clinical research 
strategy using this new model will be to 
develop weightings for each of its major com- 
ponents. For example, in applying this 
model, the breakup of a relationship might 
be a final humiliating experience that triggers 
a depressive episode in a young person with 
a family history of affective disorder. Such an 
individual may also have poor social supports 
which interact with the other identified risk 
factors to increase the individual's vul- 
nerability for suicide. The question is, at 
what level and in what degree do each of 
these factors contribute to suicide potential? 
Is the degree of overlap of all factors the most 
significant criterion? Or, we may wish to 
pose such questions as, what makes 15 per- 
cent of the people who suffer from an affec- 
tive disorder end their lives by suicide while 
the other 85 percent do not? Using this over- 
lapping model, we may learn that the sub- 
group of affective disorder patients who 
commit suicide have a greater overlap of 
other risk domains such as increased hope- 
lessness, impulsiveness, fewer social sup- 
ports, a recent humiliating life experience, 
and/or stronger family history of a^ective dis- 
order or suicidal behavior. 

Domains of risk matrix 

What are the five domains that comprise our 
risk matrix? Ihe first is a car«fkil description 
according to psychiatric diagnosis. Second, 
personality traits relating to suicide, such as 
aggression, impulsiveness, and hopelessness, 
are important in and of themselves in charac-

terizing suicide since they may represent per- 
sonality styles that cut across diagnostic 
groupings. In addition, this domain includes 
certain personality disorders, such as border- 
line personality disorder and antisocial per- 
sonality disorder, which are more highly 
correlated with suicidal behavior and repre- 
sent risk factors. The third domain is con- 
cerned with psychosocial factorS) social 
supports, life events, and chronic medical 
illness. For example, early loss, greater num- 
ber of negative life events, the presence of 
chronic medical illness, and fewer social sup- 
ports increase the risk for suicide. The fourth 
area is the identification of genetic and fami- 
ly factors that predispose an individual to 
suicide. Previously, investigators have sug- 
gested that the genetics of suicide may be in- 
dependent of the genetics in a family history 
relating to specific psychiatric disorders such 
as affective disorder or alcoholism. The final 
factor in the matrix is the neurochemical and 
biochemical variables which are currently 



under active investigation in an attempt to 
identify either a biologic abnormality or a vul- 
nerability state for suicide. 

With respect to children and youth, each of 
these domains is at least mentioned in the 
available literature. A number of theoretical 
issues, however, still need to be considered. 
These center around such questions as, what 
are the commonalities across psychiatric 
diagnoses which increase suicidal risk; does 
the mere presence of such a disorder with the 
overlapping of the domains create the in- 
creased risk; or, is it both? 

Psychiatric diagnosis 

The diagnostic picture for youth suicide is not 
clear-cut. Only a few studies on completed 
suicide have been conducted in this age 
group. However, in the aduh literature, we 
know from four major studies with sufficient 
sample size (three retrospective and one 
prospective (3-6)), that if one sums the find-

ings about the association of suicide with 
psychiatric disorder from these studies, more 
than 90 percent of the victims had a 
psychiatric disorder and less than 10 percent 
had no mental disorder. The findings in the 
adolescent literature are quite similar. A 
recent study by Shafii (7) found that 95 per- 
cent of the adolescent suicide victims had an 
associated psychiatric disorder by DSM-III 
criteria. A high percentage of these young 
people had an affective disorder-76 percent 
had major affective disorder or dysthymia as 
compared to 28 percent in the control group. 
His work (8) also suggests that 70 percent of 
youngsters who end their lives by suicide 
have associated substance abuse, 70 percent 
have a history of antisocial behaviors, 65 per- 
cent have "inhibited" personality traits, and 
50 percent had made a previous suicide at- 
tempt. Suicidal behavior of parents, rela- 
tives, and friends, along with a parental 
history of emotional problems and abuse, 
were also significant variables. An earlier 
study by Shaffer (9) suggests that several per- 
sonality traits are characteristics of 
youngsters who end their lives by suicide, in- 
cluding tendencies to be withdrawn, perfec- 
tionistic, impulsive, or aloof. Preliminary 
data from a large ongoing psychological 
autopsy study of adolescents (10) suggest 
that at least a third of the young people in the 
study who ended their lives by suicide had an 
associated conduct disorder and that one 
quarter of the sample population were suf- 
fering from a depressive disorder. In addi- 
tion, a high percentage of these youth abused 
alcohol or drugs. Approximately 50 percent 
of these young people had a family history of 
suicidal behavior (11). Suicide attempts in 
this age group have likewise been linked to 
depressive symptoms. The co-morbidity of 
antisocial and depressive symptoms appears 
to be a particularly lethal combination in 
youth (10,12). 

In sum, it is likely that the symptom triad of 
aggressiveness, impulsiveness, and depres- 
sive symptoms represents a major contribu- 
tion to risk for suicide across the life cycle. In 
addition, substance abuse represents a major 
risk factor for youth suicide especially when 



linked with affective symptoms and impulsive 
personality traits. 

Personality factors 

Even though conduct disorders and border- 
line personality disorders are highly as- 
sociated with adolescent suicide 
(7-10,13,14), assessment of personality fac- 
tors has been impeded by lack of stand- 
ardized measures for these characteristics in 
young people. In addition, assessment of 
personality at the time of a suicide attempt is 
confounded by the distress experienced by 
the individual concerning the event. Finally, 
there is a continuum of traits and disorders 
associated with suicidal behavior in youths 
with such behavior in adults. Therefore, 
characteristics appear to be stable over the 
life cycle (15). It is proposed that certain 
diagnostic categories from the DSM-IU In- 
fancy, Childhood, and Adolescence section 
correspond to, and in effect eventually 
develop into, certain personality disorders 
(e.g., schizoid disorder of childhood and 
adolescent lead to schizoid personality disor- 
der; avoidant disorder of childhood and 
adolescence leads to avoidant personality 
disorder; conduct disorder leads to antisocial 
personality disorder; oppositional disorder 
leads to passive aggressive personality disor- 
der; and identity disorder leads to borderline 
personality disorder). 

The presumption is that ..he childhood or 
adolescent condition is diagnosed if the in- 
dividual is under age eighteen, and the adult 
personality diagnosis is used after age 
eighteen whenever the personality 
psychopathology has persisted at an intensity 
sufficient to meet disorder criteria (15). In 
addition, these personality variables may also 
have biological correlates (i.e., serotonin 
deficiency related to increased impulsiveness 
and aggressiveness) which interact with en- 
vironmental factors. It should also be noted 
that the co-existence of Axis I depression and 
Axis I conduct disorder or borderline identity 
personality disorder may represent an ex- 
tremely risky combination of factors. 

Recently, the relationship of personality

variables to cognitive styles has been studied 
in suicidal behavior. In one study (16) cogni- 
tive characteristics of rigidity, impulsiveness, 
and field dependence were contrasted in a 
group of suicide attempters and a group of 
nonsuicidal psychiatric controls. The suicide 
attempt group was characterized by greater 
rigidity in a divergent thinking task; using 
multivariateanalysiswhilecontrollingforage 
and diagnosis, field dependence was also 
more characteristic of the suicide attempters, 
but only in the 19-34 age group. Impulsive- 
ness did not differentiate the two groups. 
The results were interpreted as supporting a 
hypothesis of a cognitive predisposition to at- 
tempting suicide. 

In a similar manner, Beck and colleagues (17) 
intensively studied 207 patients hospitalized 
with suicidal ideation, but not recent suicide 
attempts, at the time of admission. During a 
followup period of five to ten years, fourteen 
of these patients committed suicide. Of ell 
the data collected at the time of hospitaliza- 
tion, only the Hopelessness Scale and the 
pessimism item of the Beck Depression In- 
ventory correlated with the eventual 
suicides. A score of 10 or mere on the Hope- 
lessness Scale correctly identified 91 percent 
of the eventual suicides. Taken in conjunc- 
tion with previous studies showing the 
relationship between hopelessness and 
suicidal intent, these findings indicate the im- 
portance of degree of hopelessness as an in- 
dicator of long-term suicidal risk in 
hospitalized depressed patients. Beck (per- 
sonal communication) has now been examin- 
ing the congruence of cognitively rigid 
individuals and the level of hopelessness in 
the development of suicidal ideation and be- 
havior. Neuringer (18) has suggested that 
cognitively rigid individuals faced with 
naturally occurring life stress are unable to 
generate alternative solutions to their 
problems; as a result, they are inclined to 
develop ideas of helplessness and hopeless- 
ness, which, in turn, heighten the risk of 
suicidal ideation and/or behavior. In support 
of this model, Schotte and Cum (19) found 
that college students under high life stress 
who performed poorly on an interpersonal 



problem solving task,' the Means-End 
Problem solving procedure (20), reported 
greater suicidal ideation as measured by the 
Scale for Suicide Ideation (21). While other 
issues of impulsiveness and aggressiveness in 
children need to be examined systemically, 
these data represent the current level of 
knowledge regarding the association of 
specific personality factors and suicide in 
young people. 

Finally, in an extensive review of psychoso- 
cial and cognitive aspects of adolescent 
suicide, Petzel and Riddle (22) concluded 
that adolescent suicide completers are even 
more isolated, less visible, and more dis- 
turbed than suicide attempters. Social isola- 
tion and impulsiveness were reported in a 
number of studies, and suicidal behavior 
within the family was associated with in- 
creased adolescent suicide attempts. They 
described a host of familial, social, school, 
and emotional problems, as well as physical 
illness, as interacting to increase the suicide 
risk. Petzel and Riddle concluded with a 
recommendation for clinical research ap- 
proach using an interrelationship of multiple 
factors. 

Psychosocial factors 

Although the data base is limited, there is 
considerable convergence of findings in the 
area of family and environmental factors in 
relation to youth suicidal behavior (23). 
Adolescents who make suicide attempts are 
characterized by considerably increased life 
stress and have had many losses (particularly 
early loss) and significant changes within the 
nuclear family as compared with other 
psychiatrically disturbed youngsters, 
depressed adolescents, and the general 
population. They have also had both physi- 
cal and psychiatric illnesses. Precipitating 
events are often humiliating and are almost 
invariably interpersonal problems between 
the adolescent and his parents or peers. The 
social and familial background of these 
adolescents is marked by parental death, 
divorce, and separation. The general 
relationship with parents is often troubled,

and discord is a frequent characteristic of the 
marital relationship. Adolescents who at- 
tempt suicide have a greater number of nega- 
tive life events, fewer social supports, and 
fewer personal resources than adolescents 
who do not. In addition, increased contact 
with suicidal behavior in the environment has 
been noted as putting certain vulnerable 
youth at greater risk. 

Family history and genetics 

A family history of suicide is a signiHcant risk 
factor for suicide. Explanations for this as- 
sociation include identification with and im- 
itation of a family member who has 
committed suicide, transmission of genetic 
factors for suicide, and transmission of 
genetic factors for jTsychiatric disorders such 
as affective disorders (24-28). A study of 
psychiatric inpatients revealed that (a) half 
of the persons with a family history of suicide 
had attempted suicide themselves, and (b) 
more than half of all patients with a family 
htstoiy of suicide had a primary diagnosis of 
affective disorder (29). A study of the Amish, 
a religious group with a 100-year history of 
non-violence, no alcohol or drug abuse, a 
high degree of social cohesion, no divorce or 
family dissolution, and a philosophy of 
suicide as the ultimate sin, has demonstrated, 
quite unexpectedly, that suicides do occur 
among this group. Twenty-six suicides have 
been documented among the Amish of 
southeastern Pennsylvania between 1880 
and 1980. Twenty-four of the 26 individuals 
who committed suicide were diagnosed with 
a major affective disorder, and the suicides 
occurred in four primary pedigrees. This re- 
search suggests possible genetic factors in 
both the transmission of affective disorders 
' and suicide (30). Another study of suicides 
in the general population found that six T 
100 suicide completers also had a parent who 
committed suicide. This rate was eighty- 
eight times higher than predicted (31). 

Investigations have suggested a high concor- 
dance rate for suicide in identical twins 
(32,33). While ten sets of identical twin pairs 
who both committed suicide have been 



reported in the literature, there has been no 
report in which both fraternal twins have 
committed suicide (34). In another study, a 
greater incidence of suicide was found in the 
relatives of the control group (28). In the 
well-known Copenhagen adoption study, a 
greater incidence of suicide was found in the 
biological relatives of adoptees who com- 
mitted suidde than in their adoptive relatives 
(as compared to adoptee controls) (24). Hie 
fifty-seven adoptees who committed suicide 
had 269 biological relatives, of whom twelve 
committed suicide (4.5 percent) and had no 
adopting relatives who committed suicide. 
By comparison, only two of the 269 biologi- 
cal relatives of fifty-seven matched control 
adoptees (0.7 percent) and none of ISO 
adopting relatives committed suicide. In 
another adoption study comparing suicide in 
persons with known depressive illness and 
matched controls, these same investigators 
again found a greater incidence of suicide 
among the biological relatives of the 
probands (3.7 percent). Of 407 biological 
relatives, fifteen (0.5 percent) committed 
suicide; only one of 187 adopting relatives 
committed suicide (S. Kety, personal com- 
munication). 

These studies suggest that we may be able to 
separate the contribution of a family history 
of suicide and a family history of affective dis- 
order to isolate high-risk groups for both re- 
search and clinical purposes. Issues of family 
history and genetic factors are complicated 
not only by concordance for psychiatric diag- 
noses in families but also by the environment 
in •"•Ts of identification and imitation of 
suicidal behavior by family members over 
long periods of time. 

Bioiogical factors 

Recent biochemical investigations of suicidal 
behavior have shown that suicide victims and 
violent suicide attempters have alterations in 
the function of a brain neurotransmitter, 
serotonin, which has been measured by ex- 
amining a major metabolite of serotonin, 5- 
hydroxy- indoleacidic acid (5-HIAA), in the 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Other studies 



3-244 




^^3 



S.BIumenthal: Oven/lew of Early Detection and Treatment. 



have measured serotonin and imipramine 
binding in the brains of suicide victims. Fur- 
thennore, reduced central serotonergic ac- 
tivity is associated with suicidal behavior, not 
only when there is a diagnosis of unipolar 
depressive disorder but also in association 
with a range of other psychiatric disorders. 
This research has found a common biochemi- 
cal association with aggression, impulsive- 
ness, and reduced serotonergic function. 
Some studies suggest that the findings of 
decreased serotonin and violent suicide at- 
tempts may increase the risk of completed 
suicide ten-fold at one-year foliowup (35). 
Arsonists, for example, show a very high in- 
cidence of violent suicide attempts (36). But 
even with the promising 5-HIAA data, we 
must urge caution. While low 5-HIAA levels 
are associated with violent suicide attempts, 
low 5-HIAA levels are found in patients with 
diverse psychiatric illnesses and also in 
groups of normal controls (37). An in- 
creased incidence of depressive illness has 
been found in the relatives of both patients 
and normals with decreased CSF 5-HIAA 
(38,39). While the serotonergic data repre- 
sent the most compelling current evidence 
for a biological correlate of suicidal behavior, 
other biological factors (neuroen- 
docrinological, neuro- physiological) are also 
being investigated actively. It is expected 
that information derived from such studies 
will strengthen the relative weight of biologi- 
cal factors in our overlap model of suicide. 

EARLY DETECTION AND 
TREATMENT 

Several suggestions have been made about 
how to prevent suicide attempts in children 
and adolescents, but none of them have been 
evaluated. It is not known whether voluntary 
agencies providing help at times of crisis have 
had a major preventive effect. It has been 
suggested that more care in the prescribing 
of psychotropic drugs for young people may 
prevent overdoses (40-42). However, this is 
unlikely to have any impact on very young 
adolescents because they visit their general 
practitioners before overdoses less often 



then their older counterparts (43), and usual- 
ly attempt suicide with non-prescribed anal- 
gesics (44). In school children, educational 
measures, including use of the media, aimed 
at modifying attitudes to self-poisoning have 
also been proposed (41). Finally, some data 
demonstrate that States that have strict gun 
control laws have lower suicide rates (45). 
Other public health measures have also been 
found to be effective. In Great Britain, for 
example, the rate of suicide decreased when 
the type of domestic gas was changed from a 
toxic to a non-toxic form (24). 

Evidence now available from two school- 
based programs demonstrates that teachers, 
counselors and other students were increas- 
ingly able to deal with suicidal students fol- 
lowing crisis training for counselors, inservice 
training for teachers, and curriculum addi- 
tions for students (46). In one program, stu- 
dents were described as becoming more 
willing to ask friends directly about their 
suicidality and were less likely to view a 
suicidal statement as "nothing to worry 
about." Students and teachers both reported 
increased knowledge about the mental 
health referral process. 

While there is no dearth of literature on in- 
tervention techniques for youth suicidal be- 
havior, the results of studies to date are 
compromised by poor methodology, lack of 
control groups, lack of evaluation and fol- 
iowup, and by the fact that most of these in- 
terventions are not based on a conceptual 
model of detection and intervention. These 
points are easily demonstrated by examining 
the published studies on whether volunteer 
agencies providing help at times of crisis have 
had a major preventive effect. A second 
form of "interventicn" is represented by the 
many school-based programs that have 
provided in-service training for teachers and 
crisis training for counselors. However, no 
foliowup data are available to evaluate their 
impact. In sum, the available data base 
points to both lack of proven efficacy of these 
approaches as well as insufficient methodol- 
ogy to provide the tools to evaluate them. At 
this point, we have been unable to

demonstrate, beyond the importance of crisis 
support, that the^e inteiventions decrease 
the actual rate of suicide, although it is ac- 
knowledged that these efforts may play a sig- 
nificant role in providing needed support and 
education about suicide. 

Risk detection ieveis 

It is appropriate now tc return to the three 
levels of risk detection to provide greater 
detail We will give a brief overview of each 
level and then present several examples. 

Individuals whom we would place in Level I, 
which can best be labelled detection aware- 
ness, are not actively suicidal or in immediate 
danger of suicide (Table 2). However, in- 
dividuals at this level have certain risk factors 
of whidi we ought to remain aware. For ex- 
ample, the ofiGspring of affectively ill or sub- 
stance abusing parents, the of&pring of a 
person who has died by suicide, close con- 
tacts with suicides and suicidal people, and 
abused and neglected children would com- 
prise the Level I group. Level I would also 
include children who have recently been 
under extreme stress, such as divorce of 
parents, moves, the presence of a chronic ill- 
ne.«s either in the children or in the family, or 
tht 'cent death of a parent or a close rela- 
tive. 1. "itii^uld be pointed out that one can

mentioned earlier, Level I contains in- 
dividuals with a high threshold of genetic 
loading for psychiatric disorders or suicidal 
disorders as well as those individuals who 
have experienced major environmental 
stressors. Recently, Salk et al. (47), sug- 
gested that several "early" risk factors, name- 
ly respiratory distress for more than one hour 
at birth, no antenatal care for the mother 
before twenty weeks of pregnancy, and 
chronic disease of the mother during preg- 
nancy differentiated adolescent suicide vic- 
tims from matched controls. 

Level II, shown in Table 3, is characterized 
by major problems that do not meet criteria 
for a psychiatric disorder. Young individuals 
who nt into Level II may require assessment, 
intervention, and perhaps even treatment; 
but the treatment is not for a DSM-III 
psychiatric diagnosis. Individuals at this level 
generally show some amount of distress, 
presence of symptoms, and/or decrease in 
function. Examples of symptoms at this level 
i ''v include pronounced academic problems, 
the presence of learning disabilities, increas- 
ing interpersonal relationship difficulties, a 
major loss, or severe self-esteem problems. 
These individuals may be exemplifled by 
youth who run away, adolescents who have 
an unwanted pregnancy, or children who are 
undergoing major stresses and become 
symptomatic. Extreme aggressiveness or 
feelings of hopelessness also characterize 
Level II in young people. Individuals at 
Level n may indeed become suicidal and are 
at risk for suicide attempts and suicide com- 
pletion. They may be individuals who have 
demonstrated difficulties relating to Level I 
and have moved from Level I to Level II. 
However, we must remember that in- 
dividuals can also move from Level II to 
Level III or I to III, or appear de novo at 
Level II orllL 

Level III represents the detection of sulci' 
youth who have major psychiatric disorders 
(Table 4). When any individual is identified 
at this level, assessment and an intervention 
component are required with the interven- 
tion representing active treatment aimed at

a specific psychiatric diagnosis. Such diag- 
noses in children and youth may include af- 
fective disorders, conduct disorders, 
schizophrenia, eating disorders, substance 
abuse, and adjustment reactions. Even 
though personality disorders are not diag- 



nosed before the ages of eighteen, they can 
be diagnosed in those youth between the 
ages of eighteen to twenty-four. In younger 
individuals, such disorders as conduct disor-

disorders would fall into Level m. In addi- 
tion, as was previously discussed, certain dis- 
orders of childhood and adolescence may be 
predictive of adult disorders (Le., conduct 
disorders lead to antisocial personality disor- 
ders). It should be pointed out that medical 
illness also can be treated at any of the three 
levels of suicidal potential 

The interactions of the overlapping matrix 
model (2) of risk with the three-level detec- 
tion intervention schema should be readily 
grasped. For example, at Level I, the so- 
called awareness level, one may have a 
genetic loading for a psychiatric disorder, 
particularly an affective disorder, or have a 
family history of suicide which increases the 
individual's risk of suicide. In addition, there 
may be stressors in that young person's life 
that impact directly on the adolescent. At 
Level II, we include the genetic, biological, 
and environmental domains, but add to them 
personality style and traits, which may also 
play a major contributory role to risk so that 
a young person begins to have more of the 
domains or risk factors interacting by the 
overlap. Therefore, the risk for suicidal be- 
havior increases as the individual meets 
Level II criteria. Future studies will deter- 
mine whether the appropriate risk model is 
an additive or a multiplicative model. Final- 
ly, at Level III, which requires a psychiatric 
diagnosis, all of the domains and levels of the 
overlap model are apparent and interacting. 
Thus, genetic and biological loading, per- 
sonality traits and style, the environment, and 
psychiatric diagnoses clearly interact at the 
Level in stage. Obviously, individuals can 
move among these levels; and it is hoped that 
individuals at Levels II and III, through ap- 
propriate intervention, will return to Level I 
where intervention is not necessary. Persons 
who are in clinical remission from a 
psychiatric disorder, however, should remain 
"red-flagged." 

Intervention and treatment 

The next issue to be considered is interven- 
tion and treatment, which should be 
reviewed at each of the three levels. Level I, 



detection awareness, requires a strong com- 
ponent of education. This means education 
of teachers, parents, and health care profes- 
sionals in detection awareness. For example, 
although controversial, we consider the 
education of young people themselves about 
their risk and about what they can do to 
prevent further development an appropriate 
arena for active discussion. We believe that 
direct information concerning suicide risk in 
relation to family history of suicide, the 
presence of alcoholic parents, or parents 
with affective disorders should be conveyed 
by health professionals in an age-appropriate 
style to young people. 

We will also have to assess whether a 
heightened awareness among physicians of 
suicidal behavior will reduce the scope of the 
problem. The issue of physician recognition 
of mental illness is extremely complex, and 
both patient and physician factors have been 
studied to explain the lack of recognition. 
Nevertheless, it should be possible to design 
an intervention program in which the educa- 
tional component for physicians focuses on 
suicide and related symptoms, diagnoses, and 
behaviors with specific emphasis on adoles- 
cents and young adults. 

Awareness education 

It is critically important to educate health 
care practitioners outside the mental health 
mainstream about the various levels of 
awareness that comprise our model These 
individuals include family practitioners, in- 
ternists, pediatricians, obstetricians, and 
gynecologists, who, while trained to deal with 
stressful health issues such as chronic illness 
or unwanted pregnancy in the young popula- 
tion, may not be aware of the additional risk 
imposed by the factors we have identified as 
part of our matrix. In addition, many young 
people may present to their doctors with 
physical complaints that are somatic repre- 
sentations of their psychic distress. 

For the same reasons, it is important to ex- 
tend our educational activities to health and 
social service personnel who work within the 
juvenile justice system. Health care profes- 



3-248 




S.BIumenthal: Overview of Early Detection and Treatment. 



sionals need to pay particular attention to life 
cycle issues that emerge during puberty and 
adolescence. We cannot overemphasize the 
need for education of health professionals. 
It is apparent from the adult literature that 
more than 80 percent of the people who com- 
plete suicide have seen a physician within 
weeks to months before the attempt and may 
have accumulated many months of 
prescribed medication which they can use to 
end their lives (3,5,6). Thus, physicians must 
be educated to diagnose psychiatric 
syndroms and suicidal behavior and to inter* 
vene and refer when appropriate. 
Guidelines for treatment, particularly when 
pharmacologic intervention is involved, need 
to be learned. 

The second task in detection awareness is 
best described as information gathering and 
documentation by health care professionals 
about the various factors mentioned earlier 
under detection awareness. Documentation 
in patient charts by pediatricians or internists 
concerning Level I factors is extremely im- 
portant. In essence, we are arguing for a type 
of red flagging of these individuals, even as a 
lifetime red flag. The major objective here is 
to keep children and youth at Level I through 
education, recognition of individual risk, and 
instruction about what to do if more factors 
develop so that we can prevent them from 
moving on the Level II or III. 

The third task is ''environmental detoxiflca- 
tion.** It is important to point out to the fami- 
ly of anyone at Level I the need to ''detoxify*' 
the home from Are arms, medication, and 
other potential means of suicide. These 
kinds of public health measures (gun control, 
non-lethal domestic gas, and removing toxic 
substances from the home) are important in- 
terventions in reducing suicide. The 
detoxiOcation should certainly take place at 
Levels II and III, but we would argue that it 
is equally appropriate for Level I. 

Level II, major problem awareness, requires 
a level of active intervention and treatment 
to deal with behavioral problems, personality 
issues, or speciflc life events. It is important 
to develop age-appropriate assessment 



scales to determine degree of hopelessness, 
aggressiveness, personality, and other 
relevant characteristics that are associated 
with increased suicid(; risk. Interventions 
should include primarily behavioral interven- 
tions (for example, cognitive behavior train- 
ing, psychotherapy, educational 
interventions for learning disabilities, self-es- 
teem training, stress management, and group 
activities). We believe that these types of in- 
terventions should deal appropriately with 
various academic problems, self-esteem is- 
sues, stressful life events, personality issues, 
and runaway problems seen in adolescents at 
Level IL 

This brings us to Level III, which deals not 
exclusively, but certainly with psychiatric dis- 
orders. Here, the use of age-appropriate as- 
sessment and diagnostic scales by health care 
practitioners is important, as is the issue of 
referral. When does the health care profes- 
sional refer? What are the speciflc cir- 
cumstances that require immediate 
intervention by the psychiatric system? Ob- 
viously, there are speciflc interventions for 
diagnosed psychiatric disorders including 
psychotherapeutic and psychophamacologic 
treatments. In addition, we feel very strong- 
ly that the early development of bipolar af- 
fective illness or schizophrenia in young 
people requires immediate intervention for 
both the patients and their families. 

Strategies for treating speciflc psychiatric 
syndromes may play a major role in prevent- 
ing suicidal behavior. Examples include the 
use of lithium carbonate early in the course 
of bipolar affective disorder to prevent fu- 
ture manic episodes or the use of neurolep- 
tics in the treatment of schizophrenia. 
Cognitive or interpersonal psychotherapies 
aimed at cognitive distortions and problems 
in relationships that occur in affective ill- 
nesses can help minimize symptoms and in- 
teractional styles that may occur with a 
chronic, untreated illness. It has been 
demonstrated that suicidal risk is probably 
high in theearly years of bipolar disorder and 
schizophrenia. Therefore, aggressive treat- 
ment during the period of initial illness might 



2f;3

Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



indeed reduce the risk of completed suicide. 

Treatment strategies for Level III using the 
overlap model approach would be to treat 
the associated psychiatric condition but at 
the same time to "red flag" the high risk 
patient, paying particular attention to en- 
vironmental stresses and psychosocial sup- 
ports (Table 5). Psychotherapeutic and 
psychosocial treatment modalities used in 
conjunction with pharmacotherapy may in- 
crease the compliance rate of high-risk in- 
dividuals who are most prone to commit 
suicide. In addition, psychotherapeutic 
treatment may improve interpersonal 
relationships and reduce the cognitive distor- 
tions that frequently occur with depression 
and suicidal thinking. Since suicidal patients 
are difficult to sustain in treatment and fre- 
quently drop out, the use of clinic facilities, 
clinic support, or network systems to ensure 
that such individuals will stay in treatment is 
an important strategy. In addition, such 
programs provide a type of social support 
through which patients, families, and 
clinicians can form an alliance that provides 
education, treatment, and family support 
over long periods of time. Reports from 
clinic facilities for the treatment of affective 
disorders in New York, Tennessee, and 
California confirm this phenomenon (48). 
They suggest that the rates of suicide in these 
patient groups are much lower than would be 
expected and that such system approaches 
have a "protective role." 

Multidimensional intervention 
components 

This type of treatment strategy illustrates the 
interaction of the overlap model of suicide 
risk and the model of detection awareness 
levels and intervention. Affective disorder 
clinics such as those described above provide 
interventions aimed at all five domains of 
suicide risk: education to patients and their 
families (family history ana genetics); 
development of network and support sys- 
tems (psychosocial and environment); iden- 
tification and treatment of associated 
psychiatric disorder (psychiatric disorder, 



biological factors), and psychotherapeutic in- 
terventions (personality factors, psychiatric 
diagnosis, family problems). Interventions 
such as these clinics provide, which encapsu- 
late as many domains as possible, increase the 
possibility of preventing suicide in high-risk 
persons. These programs follow persons in 
remission as well as during illness; therefore, 
individuals remain "red flagged." 

Other psychiatric illnesses that require 
similarly aggressive interventions include al- 
coholism and drug abuse, particularly among 
youth, and disorders of childhood and adoles- 
cence such as conduct disorders and antiso- 
cial behavior. Interventions that involve as 
many domains as possible, including family 
treatment, environmental modification, and 
treatment of the behavioral disorder, will 
maximize prevention of suicidal behavior. 
Again, the need to detoxify the home should 
be apparent. In each case, one should follow 
crisis management principles, use 
psychotherapeutic and/or psychophar- 
macologic interventions when appropriate, 
but also include environmental interven- 
tions. It is important to educate the family 
and, when necessary, to treat the family. 

Several final points with respect to interven- 
tion and treatment issues include the need to 
develop foUowup strategies and a schema to 
ensure that children at risk will not engage in 
recurrent suicidal behavior. Difficult issues 
often arise for the clinician in treating such 
cases. In general, young suicidal patients are

diflicult to manage and may seem at times un- 
rewarding to treat, and the child and family 
may be excessively demanding. These fac- 
tors may make the physician feel increasing- 
ly helpless and inadequate. It is important 
for health care professionals to keep these is- 
sues in mind and not to communicate nega- 
tive attitudes and messages to the patients or 
their families. 

CONCLUSION 

To summarize, our recommendations can be 
grouped into three areas: educational, clini- 
cal, and research. We have placed a great 
deal of reliance on education interventions, 
for example, at Level I, "red flagging" high- 
risk children, detoxifying the home, and 
developing rapid and economical screening 
batteries for general practitioners and 
pediatricians to use as early detection tools. 
It is important to highlight the need for good 
record keeping of suicidal behavior, 
psychosocial stresses, and family history data. 
Regarding detoxifying the home, even 
though national gun control e^orts have not 
succeeded at this point, it is appropriate to 
argue that stricter gun control is a method for 
decreasing suicide among youth. Studies 
have shown that States with strict gun control 
have lower suicide rates (45). While most 
detection efforts have focused on Level III 
(which are still inadequate because 
psychiatric illness is underestimated in 
youth), relatively little has been done at 
Level II and almost nothing at Level I. 
Recent studies show increasing rates of af- 
fective disorder and conduct disorder in 
young people (49). Even so, very few people 
really understand the relationship of any of 
these detection levels to suicidal behavior 
and where to go for help for the problems 
identified in each of the levels. With respect 
to the clinical arena, it is important to edu- 
cate clinicians about the diagnostic criteria 
for psychiatric illnesses in young people and 
the most effective treatments for specific 
psychiatric syndromes in youth. From our 
discussion, it should be apparent that future 
directions for research operate at every one 
of the three levels that we have described and 



that all three clearly need considerable atten- 
tion. 

However, research should not be confined to 
one level because there is considerable over- 
lap across levels. It is hoped that the outline 
of these strategies can significantly enhance 
our approaches to the early detection and in- 
tervention of suicidal behavior in young 
people and, thereby, prevent this tragic loss 
of human life in our country.

SPECIFIC TREATMENT MODALITIES FOR 
ADOLESCENT SUICIDE ATTEMPTERS 

PaulD. Trautman, M,D„ Assistant Professor of Clinical Psychiatry, Columbia University 
College of Physicians and Surgeons, and New York State Psychiatric Institute, 
New York, New York 



INTRODUCTION 

The treatment of adolescent suicide at- 
tempters is a particular interest of mine. I 
have been working with this population for 
about five years, along with David Shaffer, 
M.D., to develop interviews which identify 
the symptoms and problems of suicide at- 
tempters. More recently, I worked with 
Mary Jane Rotheram, Ph.D., to test treat- 
ment strategies targeted as specifically as 
possible to those problems. I approach the 
topic of treatment with a bias towards brief 
psychotherapy and outpatient management. 
As director of the Child and Adolescent 
Depression and Suicidal Disorder Clinic at 
the Presbyterian Hospital in New York City, 
I am also interested in the problems of train- 
ing staff to work effectively with this difficult 
group of adolescents. 

STUDIES OF TREATMENT FOR 
SUICIDE ATTEMPTERS 

I can state quite simply that there are no 
specifilc treatment modalities for adolescent 
suicide attempters. That is, there are no 
treatment studies-psychotherapeutic, be- 
havioral, or psychopharmacologic --which 
show that a clearly defined treatment ap- 
proach is superior to no treatment or to some 
other treatment. There are many descrip- 
tions of treatment-individual, family, group, 
insight-oriented, behavioral, cognitive, and 
so forth-but no evidence that suicide at- 



tempters who are so treated might not have 
done just as well without that treatment. 

Only a few studies of treatment in adults 
provide limited support for the idea that con- 
tact with a helping professional is better than 
no contact for the prevention of suicidal be- 
havior. 

• Greer & Bagley (1971) showed that sub- 
jects who had two or more visits with a 
professional were less likely to make 
another suicide attempt than untreated 
subjects; however, the treated subjects 
were self-selected and may simply have 
been healthier and better motivated to 
change. 

• Motto (1976) made regular telephone 
contact with one-half of 853 people who 
dropped out of outpatient therapy after 
hospitalization. At the four-year follow- 
up, 5 percent of "contact" and 8 percent 
of "no contact" subjects had committed 
suicide; this difference approached, but 
did not achieve, significance at the 0.05 
percent level. 

• Welu (1972) telephoned and visited a 
random sample of subjects at home. 
These subjects were more likely to attend 
outpatient visits and were less likely to 
make another suicide attempt than non- 
contacted controls.

• Studies by Ettlinger (1978), Chowdhuiy, 
et aL (1973), and Gibbons, et al. (1978) 
failed to demonstrated any impact of out- 
reach or time-limited case work on reat- 
tempt rates. 

• Liberman and Eckman (1981) showed 
that subjects receiving 32 hours of in- 
patient behavioral therapy did better on 
a variety of measures of mood than those 
receiving insight-oriented psycho- 
therapy, but the groups did not differ in 
their reattempt rates. 

The last observation speaks to a problem 
which has already been raised by others, 
namely, that suicide attempters have a num- 
ber of problems such as mood disturbance, 
drug and alcohol dependency, aggression, 
etc., but it is difficult to know which problems 
will improve in therapy. Mood may change 
in the short run, for example, but suicidal be- 
havior may not change in the long run. 

DEVELOPING A TREATMENT 
PROGRAM 

The second part of this paper addresses a 
series of questions which I keep asking myself 
in trying to develop an effective, practical 
treatment program: 

1. What conditions need treatment? 

2. Who wants treatment? 

3. Who gets treated? 

4. What general treatment approaches are 
useful with adolescents? 

5. What can we learn from psychotherapy 
studies of other adult and child popula- 
tions? 

6. Are any medications of use? 

This paper will try to pro»/ide some, not 
definitive, answers to these questions. 

What conditions need treatment? 

A review of the literature reveals relatively 
few characteristics which distinguish suicide 
attempters from other adolescent psychiatric 



patients. Ideally, treatment should be 
designed to change a problem, symptom or 
constellation of s>mptoms (diagnosis). A 
valid diagnosis carries information about 
etiology, natural history, and sometimes, 
treatment. A suicide attempt is not a diag- 
nosis since it is associated with many different 
causative factors and diagnoses. 

SPECIFIC FOCI FOR TREATMENT 

• M^Jor Depressive Disorder (MDD) 

• Aggression, Conduct Disorder 

• Associated Physical Illness 

• Drug and Alcohol Abuse 

• Parental Psychiatric Illness 

• Marital Conflict 

• Parent-Child Conflict 

MDD. Depression powerfully increases the 
risk of suicide in adults. While only 25-30 
percent of suicide attempters can be said to 
be depressed, depression is a treatable disor- 
der, at least in adults, and therefore, should 
not be overlooked. 

Aggression and conduct disorder. Aggres- 
sion and suicidal behavior often go hand-in- 
hand. Shaffer (1974) noted that a majority of 
young adolescents who committed suicide 
manifested antisocial behavior before their 
deaths; this was also found to be true in ihe 
on-going New York Study of Adolescent 
Suicide (Shaffer & Gould, 1985). Fifty per- 
cent of black suicide attempters, but only 10 
percent of whites, had recently been in 
trouble with the law (Breed, 1970). Dr. 
Meeks pointed out that hopelessness and 
guilt are often associated with antisocial ac- 
ting out. 

Associated physical illness. Studies have 
shown higher rates of current medical illness 
among older adolescents who have at- 
tempted suicide than among age-matched 
peers (Garfmkel et al. 1982; Hawton et al. 
1982). I include pregnancy among physical 
conditions associated with suicidal behavior.

Appropriate medical management and 
education can be expected to produce better 
physical and psychiatric functioning and im- 
prove self-esteem. 

Drug & alcohol abuse. This problem was al- 
ready discussed by Dr. Meeks. Thirty to 40 
percent of adolescent suicide attcmpters 
have parents with high rates of alcoholism 
(Cohen-Sandier et al., 1982; Garfmkel et al. 
1982). Depressive spectrum disease may af- 
fect the families of some suicide attempters, 
so that some members become depressed, 
some are alcoholics, some are both alcoholics 
and depressed, and some remain disease free 
(Van Valkenburg et al. 1977). 

Parental psychiatric illness. Psychiatric ill- 
ness is very common and serious among the 
parents of suicide attempters. For example, 
maternal depression can cause disturbance 
in children; depressed mothers show 
decreased emotional involvement, disaffec- 
tion and increased hostility towards their 
children (Weissman et al. 1972). Maternal 
depression is also a barrier to compliance; 
this will be discussed later. Suicidal preoc- 
cupation in a parent and conscious or uncon- 
scious wishes to be rid of a child may push 
some children towards suicide as a solution 
to their parents' problems (Margolin & 
Teicher, 1968; Sabbath 1969, 1971). 

Marital conflict. Adolescent suicide at- 
tempters come from homes with high rates of 
marital conflicts and are more likely to have 
heard recent talk of separation and divorce 
than psychiatric controls (Stanley & Barter, 
1970). 

Parent-child conflict This is the most im- 
portant external factor in adolescents' 
suicide attempts; 70 percent of our adoles- 
cent girls report suicide attempts 
precipitated by arguments with parents. 
Their parents often exhibit extremes of ex- 
pectation and control, alternating between 
over-protectiveness and indifference, 



withdrawal, and an inability to respond to 
adolescent crisis (Trautman &, Shaffer, 
1984). 

Who wants treatment? 

A suicide attempt is a life threatening event 
and one would think that parents would be 
eager to avail themselves of professional ser- 
vices to make sure it did not happen again. 
Yet this is not so.

In a consecutive series of 77 adolescents 
treated in the emergency room for self- 
poisioning or other self-injury, 23 percent 
failed to keep a followup appointment in the 
child psychiatry clinic and 19 percent kept 
only one followup appointment (Trautman 
& Rotheram, 1986, unpublished). This oc- 
curred in spite of vigorous efforts by 
telephone and letter to reschedule missed 
visits.

Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



Our experience is similar to that of others: 



A1TEMPTER NON-COMPLIANCE 
WITH AFTERCARE 

44% of 50 8-17 year oMs (82% female) 
did not keep an appointment within 
one week of ER discharge (Taylor & 
Stansfeld, 1984). 

61% of 27 10-17 year olds (50% hospi- 
talized) did not keep foUowup recom- 
mendations (Litt, Cuskey, & Rudd, 
1983). 

88% of 138 children and adults (34 10- 
19 year olds) did not follow outpatient 
care recommendations. 

75% did not follow recommendations 
for voluntaiy admission (Bogard, 
1970). 

55% of 29 adults did not keep out- 
patient appointments (Paykel, et al., 
1974). 

73% of 296 adults ("moderate or high 
risk for suicide") did not keep out- 
patient visits (Knesper, 1982). 



Taylor & Stansfeld (1984) examined SO 8-17 
year olds (82% female) who had been ad- 
mitted to a pediatric ward following a 
deliberate self- poisoning. All were given a 
foUowup appointment in the psychiatric out- 
patient clinic within one week of discharge 
but 44 percent failed to attend. Only 39 per- 
cent of 27 10-17 year olds (half of whom were 
briefly hospitalized) complied with recom- 
mended foUowup within one year after their 
attempt (Litt, Cuskey & Rudd, 1983). In a 
study of 138 child and adult attempters, of 
whom 34 were 10-19 years old, only t2 per- 
cent of those recommended for outpatient 
care attended, and only 25 percent of those 
recommended for voluntary admission to an 
inpatient or day treatment facility actually 
turned up (Bogard, 1970). Compliance for 
the adolescent subjects was not reported 
separately. Paykel et al. (1974) reported 45 
percent compliance among 29 adult patients 
given an outpatient clinical referral following 



er|c ^"^^ 



an attempt. In a study of 296 adult patients 
who were judged to be at moderate to high 
risk for suicide at an emergency room visit, 
only 27 percent kept an outpatient appoint- 
ment (Knesper, 1982). Compliance with 
pediatric referrals from emergency' to other 
clinics or from the pediatrician to child 
psychiatrist is general^ in the range of 50-70 
percent (Litt St Cusky, 1980; Hildebrandt & 
Davis, 1975; Lefebre et al., 1983; Bergman, 
Corbin & Haber, 1982; Bacon, 1985). 

What contributes to compliance after emer- 
gency treatment for a suicide attempt? In the 
Taylor & Stansfeld (1984) study, attenders 
had more psychiatric symptoms, particularly 
depressive symptoms (depression, in- 
sominia, and loss of appetite), were judged to 
have greater intent to die (as opposed to 
goals such as escape, help-seeking, or 
manipulation), and were more likely to have 
received a psychiatric diagnosis than non-at- 
tenders. This finding is similar to Ondings 
among adult patients that low levels of 
anxiety and/or depression and high levels of 
paranoid and sociopathic symptoms con- 
tribute to drop-out from psychotherapy 
(Baekeland & Lundwall, 1975). 

Who gets treated? 

This paper has already shown that 40 percent 
of attempters do not get evaluated and only 
20 percent of the subjects (at best) complete 
a three-month brief therapy program. 

Studies of drop-out rates from adult 
psychiatric clinics show that the median num- 
ber of sessions attended is about six, and that 
30 to 65 percent of patients drop out 
unilaterally, i.e., before their therapists think 
they should. In a study of 102 adolescent out- 
patients, Viale-Val et al. (1984) found: 

• 23% did not turn up for the first visit. 

• 25% dropped out after one, two, or three 
sessions (assessment). 

• 26% dropped out unilaterally after four 
or more sessions. 

• 10% were referred away. 



271) 



P.Trautman: Specific Treatment Modalities. . 



• Onfy 14.7% stayed in treatment for a 
median of eight sessions. 

Suicide attempters, children referred for 
school problems and externalizing disorders, 
and minority and low-income patients were 
less likely to stay in treatment 

One can conclude two things: 

1. Adolescents are not more likely to drop out 
of therapy than adults, as is often stated. 

2. People want brief treatment and fast 
results: either they get it and leave or they 
do not get it and leave. 

Therefore, brief, crisis-oriented treatment 
makes sense for most patients. Many suicide 
attempters have problems of a brief nature; 
studies by Henderson et al. (1977) and Facy 
et al. (1979) illustrate this point 



SUICIDE ATTEMPT SUBTYPES 

A. Formal Psychiatric Illness 

Multiple Adverse Social Factors 
Methods of High Endangenuent 

B. No Formal Diagnosis 

Acute Familial or Interpersonal Crisis 
Methods of Low Endangerment 

T 

Suicide attempters in Group A are older 
adolescents and a greater proportion are 
boys. Suicide attempters in Group B are 
younger, mostly girls, and have problems 
which are often quickly resolved, with or 
without treatment 

What general treatment principles 
are useful? 

We know from studies by Ricks (1974) and 
Kolvin et al. (1981) (see reviews by Shaffer, 
1984 and Dulcan, 1984), that an effective 
therapist for children is active, assertive, ex- 
planatory, and responsive, not passive. S/he 
uses community resources and meets with 
parents. S/he uses longer treatment for more 
severely disturbed patients and shorter treat- 
ment for less disturbed patients. The 
therapist's age, sex, race, religion, ex- 
perience, and theoretical orientation make 



little difference (Parloff, et al. 1979), al- 
though Viale-Val et al. (1984) found that sex- 
matching of patient and therapist was 
associated with better treatment compliance. 

Effective treatment for depression is charac- 
terized by: 

a. High treatment structure. 

b. A clear, well-planned rationale. 

c. An emphasis on skills training. 

d. The independent use of skills outside the 
treatment context (i.e., homework). 

e. An emphasis on self-attribution for in- 
creased skillfulness (i.e., not only be- 
havioral change but also the ability to say, 
"I did this myself and did s. good job of it"). 

What can we learn from other 
studies? 

Cognitive behavior therapies hold promise 
for the treatment of depression and suicidal 
behavior in adolescents. 

Beck et al. (1979) described the cognitive 
triad of depression: a negative attitude about 
oneself, the world, and the future. They 
argue that dysfunctional beliefs (e.g., "my 
friends don't really care about me") cause sad 
moods and lead the subjects into maladaptive 
behaviors (e.g., avoiding others). Several 
studies of adults have shown that cognitive 
therapy is as effective as tricyclic antidepres- 
sant medication for the continuing treatment 
of depression, with better treatment com- 
pliance. 

Beck's cognitive therapy seems well-suited 
for adolescents: It is systematic, highly struc- 
tured, and didactic. The patient and 
therapist work together to identify and .solve 
problems, and the patient is instructed to 
carry out homework assignments, to gather 
information about himself, monitor mood 
and behavior, and try out new behaviors. 

Meichenbaum (1977) focuses on the think- 
ing processes involved in performing a task. 
He believes that a patient's behavior is in- 
fluenced not primarily by environmental 

271 

3-257 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



events, but what the patient says to himself 
about these events. He trains children and 
adults to use coping self-instructional 
thought to deal with problem situations. 

Spivack & Shure (1974) noted that children 
with behavior problems were poor interper- 
sonal problem-solven. They train children in 
two types of social reasoning-first, to think 
of alternative solutions to conflict situations, 
and second, to predict the likely consequen- 
ces of the various solutions. 

Lewinsohn (1974) proposes a behavioral 
theory of depression which has three major 
assumptions: 1) a lack of pleasant events 
(reinforcement) stimulates depressive "be- 
haviors" such as dysphoria and fatigue; 2) the 
lack of reinforcement is a sufGcient explana- 
tion for symptoms of depression, and 3) the 
amount of reinforcement is a function of the 
number of potentially reinforcing events for 
the individual, the number of potential rein- 
forcers the environment can provide, and the 
skill of the individual in eliciting these rein- 
forcements. Treatment invoh^es the use of 
activity schedules, identification of reinfor- 
cers, and training in social and assertiveness 
skills and desensitization. 

Family therapy interventions move the focus 
of attention from the attempter to pathologi- 
cal family interactions which promote 
suicidal behavior or which the suicidal be- 
havior is meant to soh'e. Disturbances in 
family structure including role conflicts, blur- 
ring of role boundaries (e.g., the child who is 
given a parental role, or the mother who un- 
dermines her parental authority by saying, 
"Johnny, stop yelling! Okay?"), dysfunctional 
alliances across boundaries (e.g., a child who 
joins one parent in discrediting the other), 
failures of communication, secretiveness, 
and rigidity with inability to accept change or 
tolerate crisis, may promote suicidal acting 
out (Minuchin, 1974; Richman, 1979, 1981; 
Fishman & Rosman» 1981). 

These systems-theory approaches are essen- 
tially descriptive rather than etiologic, but 
are useful in that they readily lead to defin- 
ing the tasks of treatment, for example, get- 



o 

ERIC 



ting the parents to unite on rules for the 
child's behavior, or removing parental 
responsibilities from the adolescent. The 
clinician must take care not to let family sys- 
tems issues blind him to the immediate 
psychopathology of the adolescent. Depres- 
sive delusions, for example, are reason to 
admit the patient to a hospital, no matter how 
solid the family relationship. On the other 
hand, removal from the home might also be 
indicated in the absence of major 
psychopathology when open marital conflict 
has pushed the adolescent to suicidal acting 
out 

Parent <child conflict is the most common im- 
mediate precipitant of suicidal behavior and 
family sessions are an essential, if not the 
only, component of successful management. 
(A useful discussion of combined individual 
and family treatment is provided by Stein- 
hauer, 1985). The goals of the initial family 
sessions are to decrease destructive family in- 
teractions, increase communication among 
family members (including discussion of the 
adolescent's suicidal ideation and parents' 
destructive wishes), and to help the family 
identify solutions to the current crisis (Rich- 
man, 1979; Perlmutter & Jones, 1985). 
These solutions may be readily apparent 
once the family is able to state explicitly the 
nature of their crisis, and are already within 
their problem-solving repertoire. 

Specific family training programs in com- 
munication skills and problem solving have 
been shown to be effective (Robin, 1979; 
Guemey, Coufal & Vogelsong, 1981) but 
whether this kind of explicit skill training is 
necessary is unclear. In a study comparing 
problem-solving communication training 
(PSCT) with an alternate family therapy 
("family systems", "psychodynamic", or 
"eclectic"), only PvSCT families objectively 
used problem-sohing techniques, but both 
groups reported significant subjective 
decreases in family conflicts and disputes, as 
compared to controls (Robin, 1981). In a 
study comparing communication skills train- 
ing to unstructured group therapy for 
mother-daughter pairs, the skills training was 



272 



P.Trautman: Specific Treatment Modalities. . ■ 



superior in enhancing expressive and em- 
pathic skills as well as the general quality of 
the relationship (Guemey et al. 1981). 

A word of caution should be added about 
compliance with family therapy approaches. 
Drop-out rates from behavioral family ap- 
proaches are high among lower socio- 
r c-^nomic and high-risk families (Wahler et 
al. 1977, cited in Weny, 1979). Shapiro & 
Budman (1973) reported significantly higher 
drop-out rates from family therapy than from 
individual therapy and emphasized that the 
father's enthusiasm for treatment is very im- 
portant to the continuance of that treatment. 

Group therapy. Very little is written about 
group therapy for adolescent suicide at- 
tempters. It is easy to understand why: 
groups for adolescents are not easy to start 
or maintain under the best cf circumstances 
unless you have a captive population in a 
hospital. One needs 10 referrals to be suc- 
cessful in starting a group of five. Only a 
large medical center would have enough 
patients at any one time to start up a group 
exclusively for suicide attempters; and the 
group would have to be continuous, not time- 
Umited. 

An indication of the difficulty of running an 
outpatient group for adult attempters is 
provided by Comstock & McDermott (1975) 
who conducted open groups (that is, the 
patients were free to attend the group as long 
as they wished). One hundred five patients 
were so treated, and the median number of 
sessions attended was six. Only 20 percent 
attended the group for three months or 
longer. The number of patients who were of- 
fered but refused group treatment is not 
stated. This supports the earher contention 
that, given a choice, the majority of at- 
tempters want very brief, supportive treat- 
ment 

Costock & McDermott (1975) provide some 
useful goals for short-term groups: 

a. Identify situational differences that lead 
to suicidal preoccupation; 

b. Point out that action without reflection 
accounts for many suicides; label inci- 



dents of impulsive acting out as such; 
teach group members how to alter their 
tendency to act impulsively, especially 
under stress. 

c. Emphasize that alternative behavior is 
possible for individuals contemplating 
suicide; 

d. Foster psyological mindedness, par- 
ticularly taking responsibility for one's 
behavior, self-observation, questioning 
motivation, identifying mood correctly, 
and examining differences between what 
the patient said and what she/he wanted 
to convey. 

Other non-spcific beneficial effects of group 
therapy include, learning that others in the 
world share one's problems, support by 
peers, role-modeling, ventilation, and ac- 
quisition of social skills such as conversation- 
al skills and the use of eye contact (Yalom, 
1970). A skillful leader must ensure that 
role-modeling does not work negatively, that 
is with hopelessness, suicidal ideation, and 
suicidal behavior spreading contagiously to 
all group members. With its greater oppor- 
tunities for frustration and provocation, a 
group experience may be more likely than in- 
dividual treatment to bring out aggression in 
a suicidal person (Mullan &. Rosenbaum, 
1975) which may be meted out on other 
group members (DeRosis, 1975). 

Glaser (1978) and Ross and Motto (1984) 
described group therapy techniques and ex- 
periences with hospitalized and non-hospi- 
talized adolescent suicide attempters. The 
latter used group therapy with suicidal 
adolescents. After a two-year followup of 17 
subjects, they found no reattempts or com- 
pleted suicides. Glaser suggested that group 
therapy may be a useful alternative to family 
thei'apy for the adolescent who is in florid 
rebellion against his parents. 

What drugs are useful? 

Many reports demonstrate the superiority of 
tricyclic anti-depressants (TCAs) and ECT 
over placebo for the treatment of major 
depressive disorders in adults. Endogenous 



273

Report ofihe Seorelery's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



/ 



ERIC 



or melancholic symptoms (e.g., early morn- 
ing awakening and weight loss) respond well 
to TCAs in the short- and long-term (Ander- 
son, 1982). Depressive delusions are 
generally resistant to TCAs but respond to 
ECT. 

There were nc well-controlled drug studies 
of children or adolescents before 1977; three 
or four have appeared recently, only one of 
which is a study of adolescents. In a double 
blind study of pre-pubertal children with 
MDD, Puig-Antich et al. (1979, 1985a) 
found no differences between impramine 
(IMI) and placebo; the response rate was 
high, about 60 percent in both groups. This 
is a much higher placebo response rate than 
that found in adult studies, which is typically 
about 30 percent. A small study by Kashani 
et al. (1984) shows a trend (p .09) for the su- 
periority of IMI in a pre-pubertal sample of 
nine subjects. Puig-Antich et al. did find that 
high plasma levels of IMI were associated 
with significantly greater improvement as 
compared to placebo or low plasma IMI. 
This Ending was also reported by Geller et al. 
(1985) in a study using nortriptyline. 

In an open study using IMI (5 mg/kg) in 34 
adolescents, Ryan et al. (in press) found that 
44 percent improved; there was no relation- 
ship between plasma level of IMI and im- 
provement. In a study comparing 
amitriptyline and placebo, Kramer and 
Feiguine (1981) found no significant drug su- 
perority. 

Drugs for mania and bipolar disorders. 
Mania is extremely rare in children but in- 
creasingly common in adolescents. About 
one-fifth of adult bipolar patients report that 
their symptoms began before age 19, and 10 
percent report onset before age 12! (Perris, 
1966; Winokur et al. 1969; Carlson et al. 
1977; Loranger and Levine, 1978). Many 
adolescents with bipolar disorder are mis- 
diagnosed as schizophrenic; a patient of 
mine, who w.ts doing headstands on his hospi- 
tal bed, was diagnosed as "borderline." 
Mania and deprv^'ssion appear to be equally 
common first manifestations of bipolar disor- 
der, but after onset, manic episodes outnum- 



ber depressive episodes by about 3:1 
(Carlson and Strober, 1978). About one- 
fifth of adolescents admitted for a depressive 
episode eventual^ develop bipolar disorder. 
Early onset has a worse prognosis both for 
frequency of episodes and suicide Family 
risk for depressive disorder is greater for 
bipolar than unipolar (depression only) 
patients. 

Lithium is effective for controlling the 
symptoms of mania in adolescents and for 
preventing recurrence, as is true in adults 
(Delong, 1978; Youngerman & Canino, 
1978). Possible complications of lithium 
treatment include hypothyroidism, 
proteinuria (renal damage), adverse effects 
on learning, concentration and memory 
(Judd et al. 1977) and inhibition of bone 
growth. 

Carbamazipine, a drug related both to the 
TCAs and promazine (a neuroleptic) is effec- 
tive in adults and in lithium-resistant subjects 
(Nolen, 1983). 

In summary, this paper has tried to make the 
following points about treatment: 

1. We are a long way from developing a 
specific treatment strategy for adoles- 
cent suicide attempters, and on one 
treatment that will be effective for this 
diverse group. 

2. There is great resistance to treatment on 
the part of adolescents and their families. 

3. People want biief treatment and quick 
results, especially low-income and 
minority patients (Acosta, Yamamoto & 
Evans, 1982). 

4. Good therapy with adolescents is active, 
teaches skills, uses outside resources, 
engages the patient in problem-solving, 
and involves the family. 

5. Cognitive-behavioral approaches meet 
the needs for brevity and activity. 

6. We need innovative approaches to; 

• Educate families about the therapy 

process;

• Structure the therapies which focus 
quickly on specific problems, 

• Promote home visits to understand 
problems families face and to reach out 
to those who will not or cannot come to 
the office, and 

• Develop strategies which will appeal to 
minority and low-income families.

PERSPECTIVES OF YOUTH ON PREVENTIVE 
INTERVENTION STRATEGIES 



Iris M, Bolton, MA., Executive Director, The Link Counseling Center, Atlanta, Georgia 



SUMMARY 

Because a youthful suicide has a powerful ef- 
fect on thousands of young people, it is im- 
portant to involve them in developing and 
carrying out preventive strategies which they 
might view as helpful. Their depth and 
maturity of thinking, their insights, honesty, 
and frankness can provide us with additional 
solutions to the agonizing tragedy of suicide. 
Their opinions regarding the statistics on the 
increasing rate of teen suicide, why some 
young people choose suicide while others 
choose life, and what we as professionals 
might do to help prevent this tragedy can 
offer us guidance in our examination of this 
phenomenon. 

INTRODUCTION 

It is estimated that every 90 minutes a young 
person completes the act of suicide. Nation- 
ally, suicide increased in youthful popula- 
tiCiS by 136 percent between 1960 and 1980 
(5.2 to 12.3/100,000). According to the Na- 
tional Center for Health Statistics, suicide is 
the second leading cause of death for 15-24 
year olds. For every young person who com- 
pletes suicide, another 100 attempt suicide 
unsuccessfully, some becoming paralyzed or 
disabled for life. These numbers are 
evidence of a major health problem in the 
United States. 

Young people have displayed remarkable in- 
sight and depth of understanding when ad- 
dressing the reasons of why some of their 



peers choose suicide while others choose life. 
Th^ make cogent suggestions for effective 
and helpful intervention approaches. As 
helping professionals, we must continue to 
solicit their viable and important contribu- 
tions, adding these to the already-existing 
data, so that we might obtain additional 
resources in our fight against this national 
tragedy. 

Today's youth have clearly spoken to us of 
the stress and anxiety that they experience in 
today's complex world. Many of them have 
been profoundly touched by the suicide of a 
friend or loved one. It is, therefore, impera- 
tive that they be given full consideration in 
addressing this problem. It is appropriate 
that th^ become aware that they are not 
powerless, that th^ can take charge of their 
lives, and that th^ can assist their friends and 
peers by becoming part of the solution to 
suicide prevention. 

We have solicited and received comments 
and opinions from young people throughout 
the country about why so many of their peers 
have chosen to give up on life While others 
did not choose this drastic action. We have 
asked them to report to us anonymoi sly their 
suggestions for effective prevention techni- 
ques aimed specifically at young people be- 
tween the ages of 14-24. Questionnaires 
(Appendix A) were distributed with the help 
of youth counselors, youth workers, and 
suicide prevention coordinators around the

country. Two specific age populations were 
target«l; high-school age youth, and college 
students up to the age of 24. Participants 
were provided with self-addressed, stamped 
envelopes for direct return of the informa- 
tion. Age and gender were indicate on the 
return questionnaire and, in many cases, the 
respondent chose to identify hini/herself by 
name and address (the latter was optional). 

Questionnaires were returned by 82 stu- 
dents, including 54 from high school youth 
and 28 from college youth. Among the total 
number of respondents, 35 percent were 
male, 45 percent were female; 20 percent 
replied anonymously. All of the responses 
were written with the exception of one high 
school group from the State of Georgia 
which submitted a Hve-minute video discus- 
sion. Students from twelve States were in- 
vited to participate including a sampling from 
the Northeast, Southeast, North Central, 
South Central, Northwest and Southwest. 
States included were New York, Maryland, 
Pennsylvania, Georgia, Minnesota, Kansas, 
Texas, Washington, Montana, Illinois, North 
Dakota, and California. Responses were 
received from Washington, California, Min- 
nesota, Kansas, Maryland, and Georgia. 

DOCUMENTATION OF OTHER 
RESOURCE STUDIES 

Many authorities have described the attrac- 
tion that the act of suicide holds for some 
young people in distress. Few researchers 
have gone directly to the source: to youth 
themselves. One account, in particular, 
called Loss and Grief Overload by Judith M. 
Stillion of Western Carolina University 
provides such a clear analysis of current 
youthful problems and attitudes that it is out- 
lined here to serve as confirmation of the 
validity of this approach. 

Ms. Stillion is a teacher who has headed an 
enrichment project for bright students. Her 
test cohort consisted of fifty persons each 
summer for four successive years. Every stu- 
dent had a measured intelligence quotient 
(IQ) of 130, had scored on achievement tests 



at least two grade levels above their current 
placements, and had been recommended for 
the course by a school oCGcial. The investiga- 
tion was a part of a project for gifted students 
in the ninth grade called the CuUowhee Ex- 
perience, then in its 24th year, the theme of 
which was to study decisionmaking using the 
components of feeling, reasoning, valuing, 
and deciding. They discussed adolescent at- 
titudes toward suicide for two days. 

The discussion was important in under- 
standing the world view of adolescents. 
These students stated that many of their 
peers are in a constant state of bereavement 
and grief. Th^ believed that the suicide rate 
was already proportional to the increase in 
loss experienced by young people today. 
Several sources of loss which they listed are: 
body changes, the increasing divorce rate, 
geographical relocation and moving away 
from friends and support groups, stress and 
tension ass Delated with living up to parental 
expectations and academic pressures, drug 
and alcohol experimentation, and the threat 
of nuclear destruction. John Mack docu- 
mented similar feelings of anger and grief 
regarding the nuclear threat in his later 
studies with young people which he 
presented through videotape. 

Mrs. Stillion concluded her study with many 
good suggestions, including; 

1. Stop considering kids as innocents. 
They're ^ot. 

2. Think of them as veterans of grief and los^ 
who have not yet learned to cope. 

3. See that they find adults who can teach 
them about coping and who w»',. give them 
permission to express their sorrow and 
pain, talk out their anger and resolve their 
grief. 

4. Consider applying grief counseling models 
to adolescents. 

5. Help youth acknowledge and understand 
their feelings and teach them skills to cope 
with the overioad of loss.

Report of the Secretary's Task Force or) Youth Suicide 



Stillion believes that many adolescents have 
images of a safe, predictable, consistent 
world only in their fantasies (if at all). She 
concurs with Erik Erikson's theory that men- 
tally healthy people must have a basic sense 
of trust in the world around them. She con- 
cludes with optimism that we must communi- 
cate to youth that, in spite of the stress, loss, 
television newscasts and media headlines, 
there still exists a rewarding world. 

In March 1986, a special edition of Life 
magazine examined America's teenagers, 
their passions and problems. They put 
together a nationwide team of 22 teenage 
reporters and assigned them the task of inter- 
viewing their high school peers. They looked 
at what the 25.5 million youngsters bom be- 
tween 1967 and 1973 were doing. The sur- 
vey concluded that "the highs are the highest, 
the lows the lowest; it's the first time and the 
last time and forever." Adolescence has 
never been tougher with all-time-high num- 
bers of teen runaways, pregnancies, im- 
prisonments, and suicides. 

Although the Life survey was criticized for 
containing shallow and vapid questions relat- 
ing to current sayings, hairstyles, eating 
habits, etc., many of the questions allowed us 
a composite view of the more serious pres- 
sures facing today's adolescents. For in- 
stance it was reported that "marijuana 
smoking is as regular as breathing." When 
asked, "What do you want to be when you 
grow up?" most teens responded "rich." 
Regretfully, the Life report missed the op- 
portunity to deal with the teens' attitudes 
about suicide, depression, and stress. 

HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT 
RESPONSES TO THE 
QUESTIONNAIRE 

In February and March of 1986 qi^estion- 
naires were given to high school students 
across the country. They were asked to 
respond to four questions relating to suicide. 
The first question v as as follows: 



"In your opinion, why are so many young 
people between the ages qf 15-24 attempt' 
ing suicide tod^?* 

In reviewing the responses, it is clear that 
high school youth feel that they are living ex- 
traordinary stressful lives, due in part to pres- 
sure from family, school, peers, and others in 
authority. Some thought that they are being 
pushed too hard to achieve. A student from 
Pennsylvania said: "society expects too much 
from us like ... get good grades, go to a good 
college, get a good job, make a lot of money, 
be a success." Other students felt pressure to 
be perfect and never make mistakes. They 
felt they could not live up to the many expec- 
tations which were placed on them by 
parents, and society as a whole. They spoke 
of competition and giving up when it became 
clear that they couldn't "measure up." 

Many students attributed suicide attempts to 
wanting attention from parents or friends or 
"to see if anybody cares." There was a near 
consensus that people who attempt suicide 
are lonely, sad, depressed, have low self-es- 
teem, feel unloved, rejected, unwanted, or 
feel they are in the way. A student from 
Georgia said "if I killed myself, my friends 
wouldn't have to put up with me anymore." 
They talked of the cruelty of "friends" who 
"criticize, call you names, or make fun of you." 

The high school students spoke to the feel- 
ings of hopelessness when too many 
problems piled up and they didn't feel com- 
fortable sharing that with anyone. Being 
overwhelmed with pain and sadness and "not 
being able to trust anyone" was a common 
statement. One student lamented, "they 
don't know where to turn so they turn to the 
easy way out." A 16-year- old girl speaking of 
those who think of suicide said, "if people 
don't try to do something to stop them, they 
(the youngsters) think that tliey (the adults) 
really don't care." Some students believed 
that most people really don't mean to go 
through with suicide; they leave hints and 
hope somebody will stop them. 

A number of respondents wrote about the 
meaninglessness of life in terms of feeling 



3-266 



I.Bolton: Perspectives of Youth... 



bored. There is nothing for us to do ... there 
is nothing to live for ... there is no purpose to 
life." A student from Washington wrote "I 
don't feel needed, important, valuable ... so 
what's the point of living?" 

A common issue for teens attempting suicide 
was discussed as "confusion about sexual 
identity." Comments were written as follows: 
Tou have guilt about your sexuality, your ac- 
tions .... you have fears of being gay." Also, 
"due to religious upbringing, guilt and fear of 
being evil or a sinner is terrifying. You're 
afraid you will be punished by God, so you 
might as well go ahead and punish yourself." 

Drug and alcohol abuse was viewed by stu- 
dents as an important reason for some kids 
attempting suicide. "There is a lot of peer 
pressure to do drugs and they are used for 
recreation ... people can't handle it ... if 
you're already depressed, using drugs exag- 
gerates and magnifies your feelings." Punk 
music aud rejection by friends was also men- 
tioned frequently as causes for attempted 
suicide. Other issues discusse-d included kids 
who are abused physically or sexually, kids 
who are angry and have no outlet for their 
anger, teen pregnancy and the associated 
guilt and shame, as well as getting revenge on 
others. 

"In your opinion why are so many young 
people between the ages 15-24 completing 
suicide today ?" 

A number of responses from high school stu- 
dents repeateu and emphasized the same 
reasons as for attempting, with special em- 
phasis on stress and pressure to achieve. Ad- 
ditional relevant comments include the 
following: 

"Suicide is an escape from too many problems 
at once" 

"They don't actually see themselves DEAD" 

"People don't take the warnin,» signals 
seriously" 

"Everyone would be better off if I was dead" 
"It's so easy to get a gun or other weapon" 



.ERIC 



"Revenge, to make everyone soriy and guilty" 

"Breakup of a romance" 

Adolescents get depressed because they tell 
themselves things that aren't true, such as 
"I'm stupid ... nobody likes me ... I'll never 
stop hurting ... it's hopeless ... I'm hopeless." 
Another comment was "sometimes you 
believe you are crazy and you're better off 
dead." 

The third question was stated as follows: 

"What do you think can be done to prevent 
suicideV 

Answers ranged from things individuals can 
do to suggestions for society in general. Typi- 
cal responses were: 

"Use students as counselors because they re- 
late better to their peers" 

"Have telephone counseling lines" 

"We need more speakers in high school and 
junior high to educate students, teachers and 
parents." 

"Relieve some of the pressures" 

"Take all threats seriously" 

Teen clubs would help kids have something 
to do" 

Tell teens bad times won't last" 

"Have dinner together as a family-we never 
see each other anymore" 

It is apparent, from the responses, that these 
high school students want to be included in 
problem solving and helping to save lives. 

The last question in the questionnaire ad- 
dresses the issue of why people do not com- 
mit suicide. The question was posed as 
follows: 

"Why do you think most young people do 
not commit suicide?'' 

Most of the respondents concluded that the 
reasons most people do not commit suicide is 
that life is going well for them; they have 
friends; they know how to ask for what they 
want; they realize the pain or the problem 



281 3.267 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



won't last forever; and they have goals for the 
future. Others felt that these teens had 
people to talkwith who understood them and 
who listened to them without tiying to sohre 
their problems. Some thought that many 
kids are taught that suicide is morally wrong 
and their religious belie£5 kept them from 
doing it. 

A few teens felt that their peen did not com- 
mit suicide because they were afraid to die 
and frightened of the pain involved. They 
were also frightened that they might be dis- 
abled if they did not succeed. A few teens ex- 
pressed the thought that if no weapons or 
pills could be found in the house, the depres- 
sion and urge to kill themseh'es might pass. 

On a positive note, several respondents 
stated, 

They have a love of life in spite of trouble** 

They are not afraid to tell someone they are 
in trouble or to ask for help" 

"Most teens value their life, even in spite of 
present circumstances" 

COLLEGE STUDENT 
RESPONSES TO THE 
QUESTIONNAIRE 

College students in the some geographical 
areas were given the same questionnaire as 
the high school students. The first question 
was as follows: 

"//I your opinion why are so many young 
people between the ages qf 15-25 attempt- 
ing suicUktodayr 

Their responses were similar to those of the 
.high school students, citing pressure to 
achieve beyond their abilities, high pressure 
from family, peers, school, themselves, and 
society to perform, drug and alcohol involve- 
ment and abuse, family problems, loneliness, 
and hopelessness. They addressed the issues 
of low self-esteem, inability to communicate, 
a combination of problems, inadequate social 
skills, losing a boyfriend/girlfriend, and not 
knowing how to cope. There were numerous 
responses from students who believed that 



suicide attempts were for attention-getting 
and were a ciy for help which had gone un- 
heard. Some of the specific comments were 
as follows: 

"Possibly we lack the mental toughness that 
it takes to face the reality of the real world." 

"As an animal scientist, a very important prin- 
ciple was constantly drilled into my head- 
genotype (internal) x environment = 
phenotype (the outward expression of a 
trait). Environmental factors are numerous: 
breakdown of the traditional family, lack of 
responsibility, pressure to achieve beyond 
their ability, a means of drawing attention." 

"I have been involved in three diRierent situa- 
tions where people wanted to commit 
suicide. In all three cases, I felt the major 
problem was that the persons did not like 
themselves, mainly because of a hard situa- 
tion that had happened to them (abortion, 
break-up of a relationship). In all cases it 
seemed the only way out." 

The second question presented to college 
students was as follows: 

"//I your opinion why are so many young 
people between the ages qf 15-24 complet- 
ing suicide today?* 

Responses in this category again reflected 
the thinking of the high school students with 
a number of additions as follows: 

"Younger people are committing suicide be- 
cause they feel inadequate or they aren't 
given enough attention. More should be 
taught about the psychological thoughts of 
children" wrote a 21 -year-old female who in- 
dicated that a friend had committed suicide. 

Too many pressures to think and act like 
adults. When I was 15 my mother decided to 
remarry. I was expected to understand and 
hold back all my anger." 

"Unemployment is a problem ... now ... in col- 
lege, part-time ... and later. Maybe I won't be 
able to get a job to support myself." 

"People don't realize the permanence of 
suicide." 



3-268

LBolton: Perspectives of Youth... 



"A lot of kids are selfish and don't think of 
anybody but themselves." 

"If you can't equal your parents' success, why 
tiy? Take the easy way out and kill yourself" 

"A lot of kids only meant to attempt but end 
up dead because they didn't know how to 
save themseWcs." 

"Feeling lonely and trapped-comered." 

"The media show life's problems solved 
quickly and painlessly. Youth expect to lead 
such happy lives, quickly resolving their 
problems. You agonize over decisions and 
you fear failure." 

"Both people I know killed themselves be- 
cause of drugs." 

"I don't know who I am and what my purpose 
on earth is. Finding my identity is hard--I 
might as well give up now." 

Question 3 of the survey asks: 

*What do you think can be done to prevent 

College students discussed a variety of 
preventive measures involving the in- 
dividual, the family, schools, and society. 
Pertinent responses are as follows: 

"We need more education about suicide for 
students, teachers and parents. We need to 
know the warning signs of depression." 

Teach kids a more realistic view of life." 

"Allow for failure and help kids realize you 
can learn from your mistakes." 

"Let students know that others have the very 
same problems and they just hide it better." 

"Tell them it isn't okay to die." 

"I don't like my problems, but I know they are 
temporary." 

"Let kids create plays and improvisations 
about suicide for other kids to see-kids lis- 
ten to kids." 

"Encourage kids to plan conferences them- 
selves on suicide. Adults can advise, but let 
kids get involved in a6tual)y doing it." 



Teach the consequences of suicide on fami- 
ly and friends." 

"Deglamourize suicide. Kids need to know 
the goiy details and that it is not romantic. 

A 24-year-old male from Athens, Georgia 
summed up his suggestions for preventing 
suicide with these comments: 

a. "Parents taking more time to really talk 
with their children and being courageous 
enough to openly discuss with them their 
problems." 

b. "Giving children tasks to perform to estab- 
lish early on their own personal impor- 
tance in the scheme of thmgs." 

c. "Don't spoil children by constantly giving 
them material things, but instead, give 
them your time." 

d. "Encourage children to do their best, but 
make them understand that their own per- 
sonal best may be less than someone else's, 
and that's okay." 

e. "Encourage children to spend more time 
in creative activity and athletic activity 
rather than just sitting and watching 
television for hours on end." 

The last question for college students posed 
in the questionnaire was: 

"H%y do you think most young people do 
not commit suicide?" 

The essence of comments from college youth 
is as follows: 

"Feelings of rcsponsibilitj' or guilt." 
Too scared to do it." 
"Hopeful about the future." 
"Have few problems." 
"Strong support network." 
"They enjoy life." 

"I thought of how others would feel ... I 
couldn't do that to them." 

"Mental toughness."

Th^ have goals and dreams." 

They let their anger out in other ways." 

"They know that all problems can be solved 
and that nothing is so bad that th^ have to 
die over it Things just feel that way some- 
times." 

"The knowledge that I do have something to 
offer ... maybe not now, but some day." 

"It's okay to fail and to be imperfect, if I do 
my best and learn from my mistakes." 

"Since Gcd made me I must be valuable and 
okay." 

"My religious teachings keep me from 
suicide." 

"I'm afraid of what I might miss if I killed 
myself." 

SUMMARY AND 
RECOMMENDATIONS 

Through a sampling of high school and col- 
lege students' attitudes about suicide, it is 
clear that many of their lives are full of com- 
plexities, pressures, stress and frustrations. 
A 22-year-old female from Minnesota spoke 
for a number of her peers when she wrote: 

"Attemptingsuicideisaciyforhelp. Too 
many people take life for granted and too 
many people take love for granted. 
Without expression of such feelings, 
people of ages 14-24 can feel neglected 
and useless. On a more personal basis, in 
the early twenties or late teens there are 
a lot of transitions, walls of financial un- 
certainty, too many paths to follow and 
decisions to make with no one to really 
help. If you're standing on shifting sand, 
lacking control of life, what better way to 
control it than to end it? Completed 
suicides, I feel, are attempted suicides 
that went too far. People who attempt 
suicide want to be helped, but are too 
hasty and sometimes the result is a com- 
pleted suicide. I think that when suicide 
is actually completed, it has been an ac- 
tion taken because of a gnawing growth 



of self-disappointments over many years. 
Some people just feel that life just isn't 
satisfying enough. I just don't under- 
stand why these people don't speak 
louder or more obviously to get the help 
they need. Sometimes people can't lis- 
ten because they aren't spoken to open- 
ly enough." 

The energy and enthusiasm of the youth who 
responded to the task of suggesting solutions 
to the problem of suicide is encouraging and 
gratifying. They took their charge seriously 
and gave thoughtful ideas with mature in- 
sights. Suggestions covered four main areas 
including preventive measures for in- 
dividuals, families, schools, and society. 

Recommendations for Individuals 
(Ages 14-24) 

It was probably no accident that major em- 
phasis was given to the area of individual 
responsibility and initiative. Although the 
three other areas were important to them, it 
is observed here that young people are aware 
that it is their own coping skills and abilities 
which can save lives. Th^ do not hide from 
the reality that they themselves have the 
power to be in charge of their own lives, even 
though at times they may feel powerless. 
They observe that they may not be able to 
control events in their lives, but that they can 
take charge of how they respond to those 
events. 

A general theme among all the students was 
learning sufficient coping skills to handle 
crises, especially a suicidal one for themsel- 
ves, or for someone else. To learn how to 
cope and how to solve problems was a 
priority. It was suggested that when some- 
one had suicidal thoughts and images, they 
could consciously replace them with more 
positive concepts and thoughts. To go fur- 
ther, young people wanted to change their 
own attitudes about counseling so that there 
would be more freedom to seek counseling 
without fear of being labeled "crazy" or "in- 
adequate."

Students wanted to find ways to decrease the 
pressure they felt from parents, peers, 
teachers, others in authority, and their own 
self-imposed pressure to perform and 
achieve. It was felt that if they could open 
lines of communication with others and take 
responsibility for giving feedback about the 
kind of pressure they were feeling, they at 
least would not feel like victims. 

A major insight and recommendation from 
youth was that if they were to risk sharing 
their humanness and vulnerability with 
others, then everyone would begin to realize 
that most people have the same problems 
and the same feelings. One student told of a 
7-year-old boy who found a Playboy 
magazine and looked at the pictures. When 
asked what he thought of the naked people 
in the pictures, he thought a moment and 
then said, "Well, under clothes, everybody is 
naked!" A 20-year-old from California said: 
"Letting down the barriers and taking off our 
masks is a way to begin to understand that we 
are not alone, and that others experience the 
same feelings. 

Self-esteem is important to youth and finding 
ways to feel valued and worthwhile is an im- 
portant task. They suggest loving yourself 
unconditionally, just because you were bom, 
and not because of what you do. If you can 
do that, it doesn't matter who else loves you 
because you always have yourself and your 
self-respect. 

The students were concerned with finding a 
purpose in life, some meaning or goal for the 
future. They suggested that a skill for coping 
with depression was to find something you 
wanted to do in the future that if you died you 
would never have the opportunity to do ... a 
real "missed opportunity." They suggested 
picturing what the future would be without 
you and without your contribution. To an- 
ticipate something in the future is to have 
hope. 

The fast-paced, complex life of school, 
relationships, family, cars, drugs, alcohol, 
peer pressure, and the accumulation of 
problems can lead to wanting to end one's 



life. A 19-year-old female from New Jersey 
said, "I didn't want to end my life, I wanted to 
end what was going on in my life ... and there's 
a difference." This insight is rare and needs 
to be translated to others, according to many 
college students. 

The wisdom of youth tells us that we must 
learn patience in an impatient world; that 
pain does not last forever, nor does joy. It is 
important to know that depression doesn't 
last a lifetime, even though it may feel that 
way sometimes. Additionally, when dis- 
couragement and pressure to achieve are ex- 
perienced, it is important to remember that 
it took parents a long time to be successful 
too. 

Individuals need to understand that suicide is 
a permanent solution to a temporary 
problem. They need to take responsibility to 
ask for help when they need it. They need to 
find outlets for anger so it doesn't get bottled 
up. They need to know they are not helpless 
even when they are abused. Many students 
suggested getting help from their minister or 
rabbi or from their religious beliefs. 

The students discussed the need to deal with 
relationships in terms of learning how to get 
into one, how to keep it together, and how, 
when appropriate, to get out of the relation- 
ship without destroying one another. 

Students recommended that everyone have 
a support system of several people whom 
they trust fo they may confide in them during 
stressful times. 

Since most young people realize that they ex- 
perience many losses in their lives, they 
recommend learning about the process of 
grief and how to handle loss. They suggest 
that the individual give him/herself permis- 
sion to learn from mistakes without being 
devastated and especially that they learn to 
laugh at themselves. One 24-year-old stu- 
dent stated, "to be able to minimize the heavi- 
ness and seriousness of life with laughter is to 
be able to survive." 

Finally, young people wanted their peers to 
take responsibility to plan conferences ad- 



285

Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



dressing the problem of depression, stress, 
and suicide. They believe that peers listen to 
peers and that they can have the greatest im- 
pact on one another. Th^ advised that 
youth work alongside adults in an education- 
al preventive effort at educating other youth 
in terms of warning signs, interventions, and 
counseling resources. They are S)9 percent 
in favor of teaching peer counselors to help 
identify and counsel troubled youth, perhaps 
one day teaching peer counseling skills to the 
whole student body. 

Recommendations for the Family 

Youth are asking for the support and en- 
couragement of parents, rather t]nn pres- 
sure to succeed. They are asking for quality 
time with parents, including occasionally 
eating dinner together instead of everyone in 
the family being on different schedules. 
They suggest helping young people to feel 
better about themselves by talking to them, 
not at them. They want their feelings to be 
taken seriously; they want their lives to mat- 
ter and to feel that parents value them as 
people, not as puppets to perform and to be 
controlled. They suggest that parents pay 
closer attention to the feelings of their 
children and that they take threats of suicide 
seriously, especially in those who have at- 
tempted previously. 

They suggest that parents take parenting 
curses to learn to communicate, listen, and 
hear, so they can teach kids to communicate 
effectively also. They want parents to set 
limits, but to be fair in so doing. They suggest 
removing guns and large doses of medication 
from the home so that, in moments of 
desperation, it would be difficult to fmd the 
means with which to kill oneself. 

Young people are concerned about child 
abuse and wish that parents would get help 
with the stress and pressure of parenting, and 
know how to have more control of their 
anger. They also want parents to help 
children understand that "someone can be 
angry at you and still love you." Many kids 



o 3-272 

ERIC 



expressed concern that a parent's anger 
means the child is unloved and unloveable. 

Additional recommendations involve issues 
of drinking and parental alcoholism. They 
suggest that parents seek help with their 
problems, so they can set a better example at 
home. 

A Hnal suggestion for parents is that parents 
and children should enjoy one another more 
without getting into power struggles. 
Youngsters would like to do things with 
parents occasionally, but they want their 
privacy respected and their need to be with 
their friends understood. They hope that 
parents know that learning to become inde- 
pendent is difficult, and Hnding their identity 
is a major task. They need help with that, and 
with the fact that sometimes they feel like 
kids, and the next minute they feel like adults. 
They are asking for patience. 

Recommendations for Schools 

Almost unanimously, young j>.ople recom- 
mend that suicide prevention ;)rograms be 
conducted in the school, but that they be 
geared to teaching skills such as communica- 
tion, dealing with stress, building self-esteem 
and problem solving. They want the word 
"suicide" minimized so that it is not always in 
front of them. They hope that schools will 
provide this kind of training which includes 
learning the warning signs of depression, in- 
tervention skills, and what to do when suicide 
occurs. They want students, teachers and 
parents to have the same training. 

A popular suggestion was to have peer coun- 
selors in the schools so that everyone would 
know someone his or her own age with whom 
she/he can confide. Respondents to the 
questionnaire emphasized teaching coping 
skills and helping skills. They wanted to 
learn how to cope themselves, and they 
wanted helping skills to be able to help some- 
one else in trouble. 

Most students stated that they had no idea of 
where to go for help outside the school. They 
recommended posting phone numbers of 



2 Hi

outside counselors and centers in the halls 
and bathrooms of the school. 

A young man iu Georgia suggested that 
coping skills be listed on a wallet-sized card 
so that if you felt really suicidal, you could 
pull that card out of your wallet and read 
something like: 

1. Pain doesn't last forever. 

2. Go talk to a friend or someone you can 
trust. 

i. Your feelings are normal. 

4. Give yourself a break. 

5. Suicide is a permanent solution to a tem-

Students recommended that drama clubs and 
classes write and perform theatrical presen- 
tations dealing v/ith the subject of stress and 
depression, so that youth will be more recep- 
tive to dealing with the issue of suicide. It is 
their thinking that, in an age oF fast-moving 
video fren^, one of the best ways i o get the 
attention of young people is through live 
entertainment. The original student musical 
entitled, "Dim Lights Need More Current" 
performed by a cast of students from Griffin 
High Sch(X)l in Griffm, Georgia, was cited as 
an example. This kind of presentation, done 
under qualified adult supervision "beneHts 
the student audiences, the cast, and the com- 
munity," according to a 17-year-old student. 

Recommendations for Society 

The primary focus for action in this area is the 
changing of attitudes of our culture to be 
more accepting of counseling and of asking 
for help. Young people want to change at- 
titudes about discussing problems so that 
"you know you are not alone and you know 
that everybody has problems." 

Students hoi>e that society will value young 
people more in the future and will help them 
understand that their life dees matter. They 
do not want society to dictate what success is; 



th^ believe success is an individual matter. 
They hope that people will become less 
judgmental and more loving, allowing young 
people to succeed and fail in their own time, 
without the pressure of a materialistic culture 
judging everything in terms of money, things, 
prestige and power. 

Students suggest more community centers, 
supported privately or publicly, so kids hdve 
a place to go and to belong. They hope 
society will encourage more physical activity 
in this age of the computer revolution and the 
age of television. They suggest that doctors 
receive more training in suicide prevention 
so that patients who have attempted suicide 
will not be released too soon from the hospi- 
tal. They want the clergy to have more train- 
ing in prevention and learn how to help the 
attempter and the family of a completed 
suicide, so that they don't commit suicide 
themselves. They expect our society to teach 
people the consequences of suicide to 
families, friends, and communities 
throughout the country. 

REFLECTIONS 

It is the attitude of the young people in this 
country who believe that they can make a dif- 
ference that will help those who feel that they 
cannot. It is their hope that under our masks 
we are indeed one and, if not the same, at 
least similar. It is their vision for the future 
that provides them with a sense of purpose 
and direction. It is their attitude, their hope, 
and their vision that will change this wodd to 
effect not only the problem of suicide in this 
country, but that will allow them to become 
healing enablers in a society which needs 
them. As they feel needed, as they feel their 
power, as they feel their value, our families, 
schools, and communities will feel their 
presence. 

We have uw^.. ^ ivileged to experience their 
energy and their enthusiasm in writing this 
paper. Their voices have been heard and 
duly recorded, with resp<px;t and admiration.

MASS MEDIA AND YOUTH SUICIDE PREVENTION 



Alan L. Berman, Ph.D., Department of Psychology, American University, Washington, D.C. 



INTRODUCTION 

The stereotype of the mass media is that of 
an omnipotent sculptor of attitudes, inter- 
ests, and behaviors of a highly malleable and 
responsive public. After all, if the advertis- 
ing it presents can effectively merchandise 
products as diverse as detergents and 
politicians, then surely it must be responsible 
for stimulating and controlling the behavior 
of large numbers of people. 

Social scientists who have investigated the ef- 
fect of the mass media on human behavior 
have been primarily concerned with the im- 
pact (essentially negative) of television. Of 
special interest here are those studies sug- 
gesting media influences on aggressive- 
specifically suicidal-behavior among young 
people. If such a negative impact can be 
documented, then preventive efforts can 
focus on attenuating these effects. 

TELEVISION AND YOUTH 

Among adolescents, television is the 
preeminent medium and a trusted source of 
information. There is clear evidence that 
television advertising aimed at the youth 
market is successful in influencing purchas- 
ing behavior (1). Television as a whole, has 
been described as a significant source of 
socialization (2) and, by the National In- 
stitute of Mental Health (NIMH) as "a sig- 
nificant part of the total acculturation 
process" (3, p.87). 

Estimates of viewing habits of adolescents, 
ranging from 18 to 21 hours (4) to nearly 28 



hours per week (S), have led to the observa- 
tion that typical American youth spend more 
time watching TV than at any other single ac- 
tivity, including school (6). Among the more 
negative stimuli to which the typical young 
viewer is exposed during these hours are fre- 
quent depictions of people drinking alcohol 
and a barrage of violent images and acts. 

Content analyses of television programming 
have found that alcohol use, both casual and 
heavy, occurs twice as often as the drinking 
of coffee or tea (7). Greenberg (8) estimates 
that the average viewer who is too young to 
drink will see about 3,000 drinking acts per 
year, although Wallack, et al. (9) argue that 
heavy or irresponsible drinking is shown only 
infrequently. Similarly, very little licit or il- 
licit drug use is depicted on television (10). 
In contrast, televisied acts of violence have 
been described as "so pervasive that, by 
graduation day, the average high-school stu- 
dent has seen 18,000 murders" (5, p.46) and 
800 suicides (11). 

Violence on Television and 
Aggressive Behavior 

The most widely publicized conclusion of the 
NIMH-sponsored review of the relevant 
scientific literature on television and be- 
havior was that "violence on television does 
lead to aggressive behavior by children and 
teenagers who watch the programs" (3, p.6). 
Although the link was not seen as enduring, 
it was described as "causal" (3, p.6). The re- 
searchers proposed several theories, all of 



3-276 



ABerman: Mass Media and Youth Suicide Prevention 



which are common to suicidology, to account 
for the observed effects: (a) observational 
learning (imitation and modeling), (b) disin- 
hibition, (c) attitude change, (d) desensitiza- 
tion and heightened arousal, and (e) 
justification of preexisting aggressive be- 
havior. 

Representatives of the broadcast industry 
(12,13) and others (14) have questioned the 
evidence and conclusions presented in the 
government review and criticized the studies 
as methodologically inadequate and proving 
correlation but not causation. However, 
while noting that research never yields une- 
quivocal interpretations, Rubinstein con- 
cluded that "the convergence of evidence 
from many studies (of television and aggres- 
sion) is overwhelming" (7, p.821). 

MEDIA AND IMITATIVE 
SUICIDE 

If violence on television promotes imitative 
aggressive behavior, can it be demonstrated 
that media depictions of suicide promote 
suicidal behavior among its viewers? Bolen 
and Phillips found significant increases in 
suicides in the United States just after 
televised news stories about suicides with ef- 
fects lasting about 10 days (15). Phillips also 
reported evidence suggesting that both 
suicides and fatal and nonfatal auto accidents 
increased after fictional (soap opera) 
suicides appeared on television (16). 
However, Kessler and Stipp criticized his 
methodology and further analyses in- 
validated this finding (17). 

The effect of publicized suicides on imitative 
behavior has been most consistently docu- 
mented in studies of the print media. In an 
early paper, Phillips found statistically sig- 
nificant increases in suicides just after front- 
page suicide stories (18). Phillips termed this 
phenomenon the "Werther effect," referring 
to an alleged rash of imitative youth suicides 
that followed the publication of Goethe's 
The Sorrows of Young Werther in 1774 (19). 
Phillips showed that the Werther effect in- 
creased proportionally to the amount of 



publicity devoted to the suicide and that it oc- 
curred primarily in the geographic area 
where the suicide story was published. Was- 
serman extended Phillips' data set and 
reexamined his findings (20). His analysis 
revealed that only stories of celebrity suicides 
appeared to elicit imitative behavior. 
Recently, Stack reported an extension of this 
work, demonstrating that entertainers had a 
more significant effect on imitative suicides 
than other celebrities (e.g., politicians, 
criminals) and that this effect on suicide rates 
was as profound as that found for unemploy- 
ment (21). Moreover, Stack demonstrated 
that the effect was specific to those in a 
similar social role -stories of young male 
suicides most affected suicides of young 
males. 

Other work by Phillips has linked publicized 
suicides to transient increases in other forms 
of violent death that might serve to disguise 
suicidal intent, namely, motor vehicle acci- 
dents and noncommercial airplane crashes 
(22-24). 

Davidson and Gould have summarized this 
research and concluded that nonfictional, 
media-reported suicides do serve as models 
for imitative behavior (25). The evidence 
linking fictional models with imitative be- 
havior is, however, more controversial and 
less conclusive. 

Anecdotal reports of imitative suicide follow- 
ing presentations of fictional suicides on 
television and in movies have appeared 
(22,27). Radecki (11) has documented 37 
deaths by Russian roulette world-wide be- 
tween 1978 and April, 1985 attributed to im- 
itations initiated by viewing the movie The 
Deerhunter." Even rock music has been 
blamed for stimulating suicide (28). Until 
recently, however, no one had presented em- 
pirical evidence for a relationship between 
fictional suicides and imitative suicide. 

Gould and Davidson have reported the first 
such data (29). They examined completed 
youth suicides for metropolitan New York 
City, southwestern Connecticut, and all of 
New Jersey as well as admissions at six New 



291

Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



York area hospitals for attempts two weeks 
before and two weeks after each of four 
televised movies presenting fictional 
suicides. Th^ found significant increases in 
both attempts and completions in the fol- 
lowup period. 

Unanswered by this data is the question of 
whether the cases following the televised fic- 
tional suicides were new or merely ac- 
celerated, i.e., they would have occurred 
anyway at some other dme, precipitated by 
some other event. Also, no data is presented 
that directly link the event to the film, i.e., did 
the adolescent even see the film? Also, there 
is some suggestion that the attempts follow- 
ing the film were of lower lethality (resulting 
in a lower proportion of hospital admissions 
after, rather than before each film). There- 
fore, it can be construed that an ostensibly 
negative effect may actually have been posi- 
tive in that more troubled teens, because of 
the film, were stimulated to bring themselves 
to the attention of the helping system. As 
further evidence of this interpretation, hot- 
lines and crisis centers reported significantly 
increased numbers of telephone contacts 
after these presentations (30). 

With regard to increased completions, the 
Gould and Davidson data are difGcult to in- 
terpret. One of the films studied had no sub- 
sequent youth suicides reported. Another, in 
which the teen^iger portrayed actually talked 
his suicidal father out of killing himself, had 
fouryouth suicides after the film, versus none 
prior to its showing. These data argue for 
more intensive case studies, movini; from 
macro to micro analyses. 

Television and Suicide: 
"Surviving": A Case Study -Part I 

On February 10, 1985, the ABC network 
aired a three-hour drama about youth 
suicide. "Surviving" was a fictional portrait of 
two depressed teenagers who found solace in 
one another's arms and escape from pain 
through a dyadic suicide by carbon monoxide 
(CO). The New York Times' review of this 
production described it as "serious," "enor- 
mously watchable," and "intelligent" (31). 



ABCconducted its own poll of national prob- 
ability sample and found that 16 percent of 
those contacted had watched the film and 
that 93 percent of the viewers rated the film 
good to excellent (32). The majority viewed 
the film with another person (e.g., a parent 
or child), talked about it after its presenta- 
tion, and felt that it had increased their 
awareness and understanding of the problem 
of teen suicide. 

Other studies suggest that the film had un- 
toward effects. Ostroff et al. noted sig- 
nificant increases in adolescent admissions to 
a psychiatric emergency service for suicidal 
overdose in the two-week period after its 
presentation (33). Gould and Davidson's 
data for this film showed four completed 
suicides after its showing compared with only 
one before (29). 

To evaluate further the effects of this film on 
completed youth suicide, we collected data 
from iiine urban medical examiners' ofGces 
across the United States: Atlanta, 
Qeveland, Dallas, Ft. Lauderdale, Philadel- 
phia, San Diego, Seattle, St. Louis, and 
Washington, D.C., serving a combined 
population of more than 12 million. The 
total number of suicides certified by these of- 
fices in 1985 amounted to 1,843, an estimated 
7 percent of all suicides in the United States 
that year. We then compared two-veek and 
four-week data sets, before and after the 
February 10, 1985 air date of "S-. -viving." As 
noted in Table 1. there were no differences 
for either study period in: (a) total suicides, 
(b) youth suicides, and (c) carbon monoxide 
suicides. However, there was a noticable 
shift in the proportion of youth suicides by 
carbon monoxide. This shift might be ac- 
counted for by a process of identification 
with and imitation of characters in the film. 

All five of the youth suicides by carbon 
monoxide after the movie were male (the 
movie depicted both a male and a female CO 
suicide). Further investigation of each of 
these suicides revealed that only two of them 
were known to have watched "Surviving." 
Each had seemingly positive reactions to the 
film: one wrote in his diary, "I loved that 



3-278 

2!' 2 



ABerman: Mass Media and Youth Suicide Prevention 



film;" the other was reported to have 
responded to the film more ambiguously as 
"helpful." 

Each of these youths had long histories of 
pathology. One had made a prior suicide at- 
tempt by overdose six months earlier and was 
in treatment at the time of his death. The 
other left a diaiy spanning the last two years 
of his life that documented a suicidal gesture 
two years earlier, frequent suicidal ideations, 
and at least one other failed attempt by carb- 
on monoxide. The diaiy also recorded severe 
family conflict, rage toward his father, and 
problems of sexual identity. If anything, he 
had been more significantly affected by 
another television movie, "Consenting 
Adults," which aired prior to "Surviving" and 
dealt with homosexuality and a lack of fami- 
ly support. About this film he wrote: "...the 
movie reminded myself of me 100 percer>i...I 
feel exactly about males as he did. I feel like 
I'm lying to myself." 



Such psychological autopsies of completed 
suicides allow for more intensive investiga- 
tion of idiosyncratic influences not ascer- 
tainable through aggregate data analyses. 
From these case studies we can derive no 
evidence that "Surviving" stimulated new 
suicides. An imitative effect is suggested 
only in the shift of method chosen by youth 
who otherwise were known to be suicidal 
before the movie aired. 

The act of viewing a film takes place in the 
mind. The viewer cannot be reduced to a 
simple stimulus-response machine. How we 
participate as observers, with whom we iden- 
tify, what we perceive selectively, and 
whether we will be influenced at all depends 
on a variety of personal and mediating fac- 
tors: our history, our moods, our predisposi- 
tion, our needs. Heavy viewers of television 
have been found to see the world as a mean 
and scary place (17); those predisposed to 
violence might be those who prefer to watch

and who are most readily aroused by viewing 
violence (34). Those influenced by fictional 
suicides appear to be so predisposed, .ather 
than molded by the suicidal stimulus. 

MASS MEDIA AND 
PREVENTION 

One approach to the prevention of youth 
suicide is to limit or inhibit stimulating in- 
fluences on suicidal behavior. To the extent 
that the media may present models for imita- 
tion or where the media depicts behaviors 
tha: predispose depressogenic conditions 
(e.g., makes alcohol consumption seem at- 
tractive), then reducing these influences 
would be appropriate. 

However, the media may also take a more ac- 
tive and positive role in prevention. Educat- 
ing the populace could increase early 
detection of potentially suicidal youth. 
Using the media to inform viewers about 
health problems and to provide models that 
promote health-conscious behavior is one 
possible way to reach some of these poten- 
tially suicidal adolescents and thus reduce the 
population at risk. 

Public Service Announcements 

Public service announcements (PSAs) are 
the most typical mass-media vehicle for cam- 
paigns to educate the public and promote 
health. PSAs attempt to increase viewers' 
awareix**^ of a specific problem and possible 
solutions. In addition, some aim at changing 
bc'iefs, attitudes, motivations, andbeha-ziors; 
however, significant change generally fails to 
occur (6). 

The reasons for ineffective PSAs are many 
and varied. Mott PSAs consist of a small 
number of spots of varying quality, aired 
neither at prime-time nor when the targeted 
viewing audience is available to watch. In ad- 
dition, competition between PSA sponsors 
limits the frequency of showing, therefore 
limiting the saturation, dissemination, and 
reach of ai^ one message. As a result, the 
average time period during which a PSA is 
kept active is only three months (35). 




3-280 



To be effective, public information messages 
must be factual and specific and must reach 
the intended target audience. The great 
majority of those produced do not meet these 
criteria (35). On^ 6 percent are aired during 
prime viewing time and even then on local 
stations when most of the viewing audience 
watches national programming (37). Han- 
neman and McEwen found that PSAs which 
were oriented toward youth were often aired 
during school hours (38). 

PSAs are usually placed gratis by the broad- 
caster (in contrast to paid advertisements); 
therefore, th^ are placed as space and time 
permits. Some of the responsibility for this 
lack of reach rests with those who produce 
the PSAs. For example, Capalaces and Starr 
found that station managers were poorly in- 
formed about a series of anti-drug PSAs, con- 
sequently, they allotted haphazard energy 
and effort to their scheduling (39). Good- 
man also noted that station public service 
directors lack specific guidelines for attend- 
ing to these campaigns (3S). 

Evaluations of PSA campaigns have found 
anti-drug PSAs to be cost-effective (40) and 
anti-crime campaigns to be effective in 
changing behaviors (41). Other campaigns 
considered effective, however, have not been 
found to affect the young (42) and some may 
even have 'Ixramerang" effects in that the 
risky behaviors sensationalized by f he media 
may be glamorized and lead to increased ex- 
perimentation among youth (43). 

Flay (44) and Goldstein (45) havj suggested 
several guidelines for efiiective PSA cam- 
paigns. PSAs should be novel and me a 
knowledgeable, credible spokesperson with 
whom the audience can identify. The con- 
tent of the PSA should be based on scientific 
fact and delivered in a manner that minimizes 
the arousal of fear. Also, clear alternative 
behaviors should be pre^nted. The PSA 
needs widespread dissemination, high 
saturation (frequent exposure), and ex- 
tended duration of exposure. To be most ef- 
fective, PSAs need to be supplemented by 
other media (e.g., print) and community net- 
working.

PSAs have been developed that focus on 
suicide prevention. Highly professional 
PSAs have been produced by and are avail- 
able from the Los Angeles Suicide Preven- 
tion Center and the American Association of 
Suicidology. However, to date, no evalua- 
tion of their effectiveness has been con- 
ducted. 

Television and Suicide: 
"Surviving": A Case Study - Part 11 

One possible explanation for the lack of im- 
itative suicides following the showing of "Sur- 
viving" in February 1985 was the extensive 
public information and awareness campaign 
conducted by ABCs Community Relations 
Unit. The campaign included both broadcast 
and print components. Five one-minute 
news segments featuring interviews with 
specialists in adolescent suicide and stress 
management were distributed. PSAs, with 
room for a local crisis center hotUne number, 
were provided to all local stations. One 
hundred thirty thousand handbooks on 
teenage suicide prevention were distributed 
free to secondary schools, mental health 
centers, and crisis centers nationwide. Some 
local ABC affiliate stations went further, 
sponsoring mini-documentaries and even 
town meetings. 

The central element of this campaign was a 
half-hour educational program, "ABC 
Notebook: Teen Suicide" hosted by cne of 
the stars of "Surviving". Eighty percent of af- 
filiated stations carried "Notebook," 80 per- 
cent of these were aired on the weekend of 
"Surviving." However, fewer than one in five 
stations (18.2%) showed "Notebook" during 
prime time viewing hours. Perhaps for this 
reason, only 6 percent of the viewers who 
watched the movie, saw "Notebook" as well 
(36). 

PRINCIPLES OF EFFECTIVE 
MASS MEDIA PREVENTION 
CAMPAIGNS 

Historically, mass media public information 
campaigns have rested on the assumption 



that problems should be addressed with more 
and better information. Thus, information 
has been confused with education, and 
education with prevention (46). Behavior 
change does not result from mere exposure 
to well-designed informational messages. 
This "hypodermic needle theory" is too 
simplistic and has not been proven to be ef- 
fective (47). 

Effective suicide prevention must rest on the 
assumption that the target group-those at 
risk (potentially suicidal adolescents) or 
those around the person at risk (parents, 
teachers, peers)"Can be reached by, will at- 
tend to, participate in, and respond to 
preventive messages. The messages must be 
informational (e.g., signs and symptoms, 
cues) and directional (e.g., where to get 
help); but, also, they must provide skills and 
incentives to act. 

How do you get high risk adolescents, those 
who are acting out, depressed, abusing sub- 
stances, etc., to pay attention to suicide 
prevention programming? What have we 
learned from studying mass media preven- 
tion efforts that increases the likelihood of 
having positive impact? 

Sacco and Silverman have outlined five prin- 
ciples, inferred from empirical data, for suc- 
cessful mass media prevention campaigns: 
(a) information must be readily available to 
the target audience, (b) communication 
strategic must be designed to be salient to 
multiple targets, (c) contradictory informa- 
tion must be minimized, (d) objectives must 
be realistic and specific, and (e) desired be- 
haviors to be pursued by the audience must 
be made explicit (48). 

Flay and Sobel (6) suggest that mass media 
efforts must use multiple sources of informa- 
tion, extend campaigns over time, and con- 
vince gatekeer»;rs (e g., television station 
managers) o'i the worth of the campaign, to 
ensure adequate dissemination. They argue 
that more persons will pay attention if the 
message is seen as meeting a salient need 
(e.g.', offers a skill) and is delivered by some- 
one with whom adolescents identify or on 




295 



3-231 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



whom they model themselves (e.g., music 
groups, sports figures). Furthermore, and 
perhaps most important, they contend tha^ 
media programs must be both complimented 
and supplemented by school-based curricula, 
home/family involvement, or community or- 
ganization designed to increase interper- 
sonal communication, discussion and 
networking. 

The most successfully designed mass media 
campaigns that promote changes in health 
behavior are those that incorporate interper- 
sonal communication (49). For example, the 
USC/KABC-TV Smoking Prevention and 
Cessation Program consisted of five 5- 
miiiUte news segments, a coordinated 5-day 
classroom curriculum for junior high stu- 
dents emphasizing social skills regarding 
resisting social influence, homework assign- 
ments requiring adult involvement, a fol- 
lowup series of five 5-minute news segments, 
and a written guide provided to all parents. 
Students involved in the program made sig- 
niGsant gains in smoking cessation and non- 
initiation (6). 

To teach specific behavioral skills, the Stan- 
ford Heart Disease Three Community Study 
(50) included intensive mass media cam- 
paigns (PSAs, radio and television features, 
newspaper articles, bus cards, billboards) and 
face-to-face clinics for high risk subjects. 
The program extended over two years and 
significantly reduced risk for cardiovascular 
disease. 

The Crime Prevention Coalition, with the 
cooperation of the Advertising Council, 
produced the national Take a Bite Out of 
Crime" campaign (41). This program relied 
heavily on well-produced PSAs designed to 
induce behavioral change, a coordinated 
print campaign, and local community 
projects. Significant changes were ac- 
complished in six of seven target goals. 

A similar and impressively coordinated ef- 
fort, although as yet unevaluated, has been 
mounted by WQED-TV in Pittsburgh. The 
Chemical People" project (51) involved two 
PBS television shows, educational print

resources, and guides. Most importantly, it 
involved citizen outreach activities which 
resulted in more than 10,000 town meetings 
which evolved into continuing task forces to 
deal with youth drug problems on a com- 
munity level. 

RECOMMENDATIONS AND 
CONCLUSIONS 

The mass media are not responsible for caus- 
ing youth suicide nor are they responsible for 
preventing youth suicide. Yet, as a sig- 
nificant part of the sociocultural milieu in 
which our children are raised, they have the 
potential to profound alter the message en- 
vironment in which children behave. 

To the extent that publicized news stories 
about celebrity suicides contribute to the 
suicide of a youngster predisposed to suicide, 
concern within the media needs to be raised. 
Newsworthiness is an appropriate considera- 
tion in the amount and type of coverage given 
a news event. Celebrity suicides are 
newsworthy, but the possibility of imitative 
suicides as a consequence to their reports 
suggests some balance needs to be con- 
sidered. Neither censorship nor prior 
restraint* are appropriate, but limits may be. 
Elective guidelines might be established. 
Consultative discussion between media rep- 
resentatives and suicidologists might, for ex- 
ample, achieve some desired balance 
between the public's need to know, the 
media's right to report, and alternative con- 
sequences. 



* There lus been but one legal test of prior restraint, that of 
Welu vs. CPB, No. H-80-1332 (S.D. Tex. Filed 6/16/80). On 
June 16, 1980 a temporaiy restraining order precluding 
defendents from distributing and broadcasting 'Choosing 
Suicide' was denied for ladt of federal jurisdiction. The 
show, scheduled on PBS that date, was a documentaiy dis- 
tilled from 19 hours' recording of the ideas, plans, and dis- 
cussion by and with Jo Roman regarding her suicide. 
Roman, age 62, had Suge n breast cancer (80% survival 
rate), had planned her suicide over 10 yean, and died by 
suicide in June, 1979 by a lethal dose of Seconal. Plaintiff 
argued that broadcast would cause immediate and ir- 
reparable harm. Defendanu countered that the feared im- 
pact of the program wis "q>eculative,' that there was no 
definitive evidence that the broadcast would inevitably, 
directly, and immediately cause harm, and that prior 
restraint wis unconstitutional.

ABerman: Mass Media and Youth Suicide Prevention 



To the extent that the media may be used to 
educate, concentrating on prosocial educa- 
tion in early childhood appears to be the best 
possible use of the media for prevention. To 
the extent that children can be influenced by 
positive models, taught instrumental skills, 
etc., and to the extent that positive models 
are presented by the media, there is likely to 
be some lessening of the multitude of factors 
that lead to suicidal behavior. Especially im- 
portant might be the depiction of nonsuicidal 
solutions to situations of conflict and despair 
(52). 

The use of PSAs as vehicles of health promo- 
tion, information dissemination, and be- 
havior change needs to be examined closely. 
If the guidelines discussed above regarding 
dissemination, targeting, timing, frequency 
and duration cannot be implemented effec- 
tively, then, short of government regulation, 
industry cooperation accomplished through 
consultative discussion is needed. The em- 
pirical research strongly supports sup- 
plemental efforts-the use of schools, home, 
and community networking-to make a 
public information campaign effective. With 
such activities, normatwe behaviors are es- 
tablished around the goals of the campaign 
and peer influences minimize opportunity 
for non-participation. 

What is known about the impact of PSAs has 
come from their use in health promotion 
campaigns other than that of suicide preven- 
tion, primarily drug abuse prevention. 
Whether guidelines derived from these ex- 
periences are directly applicable to suicide 
prevention either awaits further research or 
requires a leap of faith. While we await, fur- 
ther research, that leap of faith appears 
worth making.

INTERVENTION STRATEGIES: ENVIRONMENTAL 
RISK REDUCTION FOR YOUTH SUICIDE 

Pamela C. Cantor, PkD., Executive Director, National Committee on Youth Suicide 
Prevention, Norwood, Massachusetts 



SUMMARY 

The cost of suicide in terms of mortality, the 
effects on lives saved and the costs of health 
care are great. Numerous factors associated 
with suicide are far-reaching and deeply 
rooted in the problems of society, family, and 
in the biochemical problems of the in- 
dividual. Each suggests a specific set of inter- 
ventions. The majority of risk for teenagers, 
however, appears to center on two areas: the 
cultural pervasiveness of violence, and the 
negative social factors of neglect and stress. 
The interventions that would appear to have 
the greatest impact on youth suicide are 
decreasing the cultural pervasiveness of 
violence, limiting the availability of lethal 
agents such as drugs and alcohol, firearms 
and medications, and instituting education 
programs for youth, parents, and the public. 



What are the theories about the causes or 
predisposing foctors of youth suicide and 
what interventions could influence the 
methods of suicide? 

This paper examines the issues of environ- 
mental risk reduction as an intervention 
strategy for reducing suicide. To do this, two 
issues must be addressed. What predisposes 
an adolescent to commit suicide? And, what 
methods do young people use to commit 
suicide? 

Regarding the predisposing factors, many 



theories abound. The factors most frequent- 
ly cited as related to the rising rate of adoles- 
cent suicide are: 

1. A high level of social and academic com- 
petition and pressure. 

2. Violence that children and adolescents are 
exposed to-real violence such as rape, 
murder, and child abuse and created 
violence on television, in videos, movies, 
and music. 

3. The lack of socially acceptable ways for 
youngsters to express anger. 

4. The lack of connection to religion. 

5. The increase in abuse of drugs and alcohol. 

6. The special sensitivity of many kids to so- 
cial isolation. 

7. The increase in tb/*. absolute number of 
adolescents in scicic U. 

8. The pressures on kids to grow up too 
quickly. 

9. The increasing mobility of the American 
family. 

10. The disappearance of the extended fami- 
ly, the dissolution of the nuclear family, 
and the changing role of the family. 

Which of these causes are amenable to inter- 
vention?

Report of the Secretary's Task Force or\ Youth Suicide 



1. Competition and Pressure: 

Suicide rates are high in societies where 
achievement is a major priority and lower 
where there is less pressure to achieve. In 
Japan (DeVos, 1968) and in Sweden (Hen- 
din, 1964), where achievement is important, 
suicide rates are high. The highest rates 
among adolescents today are in countries 
such as Switzerland, Austria, Canada, and the 
United States (World Health Organization, 
1985), all countries with a highly motivated 
young population. In the United States 
there is extreme pressure on our young to 
achieve. Ever increasing numbers of young 
people obtain college degrees and doctorates 
(in 1940, 3/100,000 and in 1971, 15/100,000) 
(U.S. Bureau of Census, 1974). Ours is an 
achievement- oriented society and children 
learn it as early as kindergarten. 

Pressures to achieve academically are felt 
particularly strongly during the adolescent 
years. Failure to achieve may be particularly 
painful to adolescents whose families place 
heavy emphasis on success. Some adoles- 
cents may choose to take their own lives 
rather than to disappoint their parents or see 
themselves as a failure. 

In order to combat a high level of competi- 
tion both socially and academically, we would 
need to encourage cooperation. This would 
mean a different ethos of society. I don't see 
this happening. 

Could we impress upon parents the necessity 
of reducing the pressure on their youngsters? 
Can we ask parents not to give their children 
a large number of lessons, not to send them 
to prestigious schools, not to instill values of 
competition and achievement? I doubt it. 

2. VIoience: 

Our society has become almost immune to 
violence. The need for social agencies and 
law enforcement agencies to intervene to 
reduce the number of murders and violent 
crimes is imperative but beyond the scope of 
this paper. 

Teens are greatly influenced by the media: 



television, rock videos, the movies, and 
music. Producers will make and air what the 
public will pay to hear and see. I suspect the 
most forceful intervention will come from 
the buying public. If adolescents and adults 
refuse to buy products which depict violent 
behaviors, the industries will stop producing 
them. I am not hopeful that this will happen 
rapidly. 

In July of 1978 it was estimated that the 
average American child, by his eighteenth 
birthday, had watched the equivalent of 710 
solid days (almost two full years or 17,040 
hours) of television. He will have seen 
15,000 television murders (McWhirter, 
1986). One study reports that the level of 
television violence in shows specifically 
designed for children have become increas- 
ingly violent. In 1967, one hour of cartoons 
contained three times the number of violent 
episodes as one hour of adult programming. 
By 1969, only two years later, violence in 
children's television was six times more 
prevalent (Murray, 1973). 

It has been suggested that watching violence 
on television sensitizes the viewer to per- 
ceive more violence in the world around him 
and increases the likelihood that the viewer 
will use violence as a means of resolving con- 
flicts (Liebert, Nealc and Davidson, 1973). 
The kids who watched the cartoons in the 
1960s are today's adolescents and young 
adults. 

Perha{», we might want to follow the ex- 
ample of Iceland. Iceland has television-free 
Thursdays to reduce the disruption in family 
life. Otherwdse transmission is limited to the 
hours between 8 and 11 p.m. We should 
check the suicide statistics for Iceland. 

Violence will be discussed further in the sec- 
tion on the use of guns as a method of suicide. 

3. Aggression: 

The inability of adolescents to express anger 
in a socially acceptable way may be contribut- 
ing to the suicide rate. In societies or in situa- 
tions where there is an acceptable outlet for 



3-286 



P.Cantor: Intervention Strategies: Environmental.. 



aggression, the suicide rate appears to be 
lower. For example, there is a lower rate of 
suicide in the army during war time. In- 
dividuals may have the opportunity to dis- 
charge aggression and hostility toward an 
actual enemy. It is possible, however, that 
suicides are hidden under the guise of battle 
casualties (Yessler, 1968). 

Young people learn about the limits of ex- 
pressing aggression in their societies. When 
they are angry, some kids may be able to risk 
open expression of aggression against adults. 
But some have to internalize their feelings. 
For these adolescents, inward aggression and 
self- destruction may seem like a reasonable 
solution for problems which make them 
angiy such as family disruption or school or 
social failures. 

It would be healthier if schools and parents 
would allow for the open expression of anger, 
frustration, and resentment within socially 
acceptable Umits. Society must move away 
from encouraging physical punishment for 
children or any method of intimidating 
chiWicn which blocks their ability to express 
their own angers. Non-harmful, non-physi- 
cal, non-combative techniques must be 
taught to parents and children and adoles- 
cents. 

4. Religion: 

It is believed that in cultures where the 
majority of people subscribe to a formal 
religion, successful suicides are low and 
where there is no formal religion successful 
suicides are higher (McAnamey, 1979). 

Religious attendance in the United States is 
undergoing change, especially for adoles- 
cents. While stated church membership has 
increased at the same rate as the total 
population, many churches are reporting dif- 
ficulties in maintaining contact with adol^- 
cents through teen groups, once popular in 
the 1950s and 1960s, but no longer popular 
now. 

It would be interesting to study whether the 
adolescent suicide rate is higher among 



teenagers whose families practiced a religion 
as compared to those adolescents who were 
never reared in any religion, or among those 
who continue to practice their families' 
religion as compared to those who do not. As 
noted by many sociologists, groups in transi- 
tion experience more suicides than stable 
groups. The presence or absence of a 
religious belief may not be the important 
variable, but rather the transition from a 
religious system to none, which might make 
an adolescent vulnerable to feelings of guilt 
and non-belonging. 

5. Drug and Alcohol Abuse: 

The association of drug and alcohol abuse 
with suicide is well documented and needs no 
further elaboration here. Drugs and alcohol 
are used by teens to belong to a peer group, 
to numb the psychological pain, and to es- 
cape depression. But drugs and alcohol are 
depressants. The substances which are taken 
to alleviate depression cause kids to become 
more deeply depressed. Whatever can be 
done by law or social agencies to stop the use 
of potentially lethal drugs and whatever can 
be done by schools, parents, and media to 
educate kids on the dangers of drug and al- 
cohol abuse will certainly aid in the efforts to 
curb teen deaths by suicide. 

6. Isolation: 

Social isolation is a factor which appears to 
contribute to adolescent suicide. We know, 
for example, that suicide rates are higher in 
the western part of the country than in the 
eastern section. This is thought to occur be- 
cause there are fewer social services in the 
West and people are more isolated from one 
another. We know that kids who commit 
suicide are often loners, withdrawn, and 
without friends. 

What can be done to help these lonely kids? 
We cannot reshape personalities, but we can 
reshape the places where the kids spend most 
of their time-their schools. Our elementary, 
junior high and high schools could have 
smaller classes. The schools could encourage 



3ni 



3-287 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force or\ Youth Suicide 



social skills, not just academic skills. 

We know that college students commit 
suicide in the fall more often than any other 
time of year. One theory accounting for this 
is that the transition from home to college is 
a difficult one. Kids move from the protec- 
tion of their families and home town to the 
anonymity of an unknown town and a big in- 
stitution. Colleges need to recognize this 
and make the transition easier. Freshmen 
need to live in small units and have more in- 
timate classes where th^ will get to know 
their professors and make friends. Large 
classes could be reserved for upperclassmen 
where support may be less a matter of life and 
death. This is probably an issue of economics 
for colleges and universities, but if mental 
health counts more than dollars, classes 
could become smaller. The same is true for 
our elementary and high schools. We need 
smaller classes and more teachers. 

7. Population; 

The absolute numbers of teenagers in society 
appears to be positively correlated with the 
number of suicides among this age group. 
The theory is that the more teens there are 
present in society, the greater the competi- 
tion for academic honors and employment 
opportunities and the fewer chances for suc- 
cess. This appears to be correcting itself with 
a decreased teen age population predicted by 
1990 (Holinger and Offer, 1986). 

8. Accelerated Pace: 

The pressures on kids to grow up too fast and 
too soon, often tasting the privileges usually 
reserved for adults such as sex, money, and 
drugs while they are psychologically still 
children, can have disastrous consequences 
(Elkind, 1981). The average age of today's 
top fashion models is 12 to IS (New York 
Magazine, 1980). The average age of one's 
first sexual experience is now IS. This places 
enormous pressures on kids who are cogni- 
tively and emotionally still children. 

Many of our teens have too much material 
wealth, have nothing to strive for, and are 



bored all the time. They have experienced 
very little external adversity and yet feel a 
great deal of internal disconnectedness. 

Again, I don't see much hope in reversing this 
trend. The only solution I can see is to move 
much of our population to the back woods of 
Wisconsin. The pressures have to be less and 
the pleasures simple. This would also help 
redistribute the population of the U.S. into 
less populated areas and reduce the crowd- 
ing in the East. Thus, violent behaviors, such 
as murders, which are thought to be the result 
of frustrations and crowding, would be 
reduced. With the increased population in 
the West, isolation and the resultant violent 
behaviors such as suicide would be reduced. 
Thus, by redistributing the population of the 
United States we could reduce both the 
suicide and the homicide statistics. 

9. Mobility: 

On the other hand, redistributing the popula- 
tion would increase the already high rate of 
mobility in the United States. Mobility may 
be a factor in the youthful suicide rate. 
Again, groups in transition, such as mobile 
families, have higher suicide rates than those 
in stable circumstances. Some of the transi- 
tional members of contemporary society are 
people living in disorganized portions of big 
cities, for example, immigrants, and in- 
dividuals transfened every few years by cor- 
porations. Studies in Seattle, Minneapolis, 
and Chicago show extreme concentrations of 
suicide in the disorganized central sections of 
the cities (Shneidman and Farberow, 19S7). 
These transitional sections of the cities are 
characterized by extreme mobility and per- 
sonal and social disorganization. People be- 
come isolated and lonely as they move into 
unfamiliar surroundings. 

Studies on immigrants produce similar 
results. The suicide rates for immigrants i& 
substantially higher than the rates in their 
countries of origin (Bourne, 1973, Burvill, ei 
a!., 1973). 

We have seen a high incidence of suicide 
among adolescents in "new" towns such as

Piano, Texas in the last few years. It is pos- 
sible that some of the suicides in the more af- 
fluent towns such as Scarsdale, New York, 
may have to do with the families of trans- 
ferred executives. We would need to look at 
the background of the families of teens who 
have committed suicide and consider how 
transient their histories have been. 

Some adolescents welcome changes, but 
others may be frightened by them. For those 
youngsters who may be uncertain of themsel- 
ves, reassurances previously provided by a 
stable home life, a stable religion, and a pre- 
dictable place to live, maybe absent. Rather 
than face the insecurity of continual changes, 
some youth may choose to die. 

10. Family: 

The traditional family is disappearing. Half 
of today's children will be adolescents in a 
divorced home. Increasingly, children will be 
living in single parent families. Even where 
two parents are present, both parents may be 
working. Women are entering the work 
force and men are not electing to stay home 
and take their place. Families are depending 
on two incomes. But the question does not 
appear to be one of divorce or of working 
parents, but rather one of involvement. 
American parents spend less time with their 
children than parents of almost any other na- 
tion in the world. The attitude of many 
American parents is that their children are an 
inconvenience, an impediment to freedom or 
to success. 

In societies where family ties are close, the 
suicide rates are low. Conversely, where 
families are not close, the suicide rates are 
high. One study contrasted the suicide rate 
(all ages) of the city of Edinburgh, Scotland 
with that of Seattle, Washington. The 
suicide rate was 15/100,000 in Edinburgh and 
20.8 in Seattle (Ripley,1973). The cities 
were said to be comparable in population 
composition, colleges and universities, 
weather, and location on the water. Edin- 
burgh was characterized as a more tradition- 
al, less violent society with strong roots in 



family and school and with a far less mobile 
society than Seattle. 

Work by Dizmang (1974) on the Shoshone 
Indians again suggests that the lack of family 
stability and a chaotic childhood account for 
their high rate of suicide. This message is 
repeated again and again throughout the 
literature (Finch and Poznanski, 1971; Hen- 
din, 1964; Toolan, 1968). 

The model for the traditional nuclear family 
is changing in twentieth century America. 
The once stereotypical family~the male head 
of the household, the female keeper of the 
hearth, and a home with children eniotional- 
ly and geographically close-is changing for 
many. The number of divorces is increasing 
(a 4.1% increase between 1960 and 1965 and 
an additional 8.8% increment between 1970 
and 1973). Exactly what the American fami- 
ly will be in the future is hard to assess, but 
there is little doubt that it will not be the 
traditional family of the 1900s. 

The changes in the American family have not 
been shown to be causally related to self- 
destnictive behaviors. The presence of sup- 
portive family, however, whether living 
under one roof or two, can help teens pass 
through the developmental phases of adoles- 
cence. If adolescents have lost one or both 
parents and do not have adequate parent 
substitutes, they may be severely com- 
promised in their ability to complete this 
developmental phase without being vul- 
nerable to impulsive, self-destructive be- 
haviors. In addition, in families where adults 
give little time or concern for adolescents, or 
where parents are not in contact with their 
children, early symptoms of suicidal behavior 
may go unheeded. The adolescent who is 
neglected or unheard may attempt suicide in 
order to get attention. Occasionally this at- 
tempt may turn out to be lethal. 

Thus, the changing American family may 
compromise the adolescents' capacity to 
cope with the stresses of adolescence and 
may compromise the parents' ability to 
recognize their children's problems before 
suicide becomes the only alternative to the

youngster. 

While we cannot influence the divorce rate 
by public interventions, and while we do not 
wish to encourage parents who are miserable 
to remain together, there are directions we 
could take which might be helpful to our 
children and adolescents. One method is 
screening programs for early detection of 
emotional and behavioral problems. Per- 
haps where parents are not capable of detect- 
ing such problems, the schools and the 
community mental health agencies can help. 
Early detection can mean early intervention. 



What are the most conunon methods of 
youth suicide? What interventions could 
influence the methods of suicide? 

How do kids commit suicide? It is well 
known that guns and medications are the 
most common methods of suicide. The fre- 
quency of use of these agents in teen suicides 
necessitates concentrating on them. Other 
methods of suicide such as hanging, jumping 
off bridges, jumping in front of cars and trains 
are less frequent and less prone to regulation 
and, therefore, have less prevention poten- 
tial. 

Firearms are the leading cause of suicide, and 
is the one method which has increased sig- 
nificantly with the increase in suicide rates 
(Boyd, 1983). Guns now account for more 
suicides than all other methods combined: 
65 percent of teen suicides are committed 
with firearms. An environmental risk reduc- 
tion strategy would call for decreasing the 
availability of handguns. Some 25 million 
households have handguns and one-half of 
these keep their handguns loaded (Cantor, 
1985). Adolescents are impulsive. Having a 
loaded handgun around the house is an in- 
vitation to disaster. 

Mandatory safety training and public educa- 
tion on the dangers of handguns in the home 
would not solve the underlying problems of 
self-esteem and depression which contribute 
to suicide, yet it would result in fewer deaths. 
The analogy with mandatory seatbelts is ap- 



propriate. Seatbelts do not make |>eople bet- 
ter drivers, but th^ do improve the chances 
of surviving a collision. 

Epidemiologic studies estimate that of those 
teen suicides committed with a gun. 70 per- 
cent of those victims could not have obtained 
handguns or firearms if there had been gun 
regulations, and some 50 percent of those in- 
dividuals might have used another method. 
Thus, it is estimated that the reduction in 
firearm accessibility would save the lives of 
approximately 20 percent of our youth (Hol- 
linger, 1984). 

Limited gun control, such as mandatory wait- 
ing period and background check for hand- 
gun purchasers is one step. Others might 
include licensing of handgun owners and 
halting the manufacture and sale of snub- 
nosed hand guns. The sale of handguns to in- 
dividuals with a history of psychiatric 
hospitalizations or previous suicide attempts 
might be prohibited and regulations might 
differentiate between handguns and other 
firearms. 

While the issue of gun control is a controver- 
sial political concern, the bulk of the 
evidence seems to suggest that it would be an 
effective me*hod of reducing the suicide rate 
(Westermeyer, 1984; Browning, 1974; 
Markush and Bartolucci, 1984; Boyd, 1983; 
Hudgens, 1983; Lester and Murrell, 1980, 
1982; Lester, 1983). 

When highly lethal methods of suicide are 
less available, (evidence shows that people do 
not necessarily switch to other means. When 
the English converted their home heating gas 
from deadly carbon monoxide-containing 
coke gas to low-lethality natural gas, the 
suicide rate dropped 33 percent. The low 
rate has remained constant despite the bleak 
economic picture in England which might 
have been expected to lead to an increase in 
the suicide rate (Kreitman, 1982; Seiden, 
1984). 

While the mere correlation between guns 
and violent deaths does not indicate 
causality, it is clear that strict gun control laws 
in many countries are correlated with a lower 



3-290 



P.Cantor: Intervention Strategies: Environmental... 



incidence of homicide and suicide. For ^- 
ample, all guns must be registered in the 
Nethei lands; in Italy and Norway, guns are 
seldom used by the public. In some countries 
private ownership of a pistol is forbidden to 
everybody except the police, military person- 
nel, and a few competitive marksmen. "In 
Great Britain, most persons, including offi- 
cials of the British Rifle Association, fmd it 
difficult to comprehend the notion of the 
right to bear arms, as espoused by many per- 
sons in this country" (Fredericks, 1984). 

While it is true that other means of commit- 
ting suicide are used in countries where 
firearms are not available, little doubt 
remains that the availability of firearms 
makes violent acts such as suicide, easier to 
commit-and the lethality of the act has no 
peer. If an individual can be deterred from 
committing suicide, even temporarily, his 
chances for survival increase, which with gun 
in hand, would be lost. 

Poisoning, usually with prescription 
medicine, is the second most common 
method of suicide, accounting for 11.3 per- 
cent of all suicides. The availability of lethal 
drugs could be limited by restricting the num- 
ber of tablets permitted for each prescrip- 
tion. This kind of legislative restriction on 
sedative and hypnotic drugs is thought to be 
largely responsible for the decline in the 
suicide rates in Australia in the 1960s and 
1970s (Oliver and Hetzel, 1973). 

In addition, the tricyclic anti-depressants 
could be sold with an emetic or antidote. If 
a teen overdosed and changed his/her mind 
or was found, an antidote could be given and 
a life could be saved. Projections claim this 
method might save approximately 3 percent 
of teen suicides per year (Holinger, 1985). 

The first antidote ever developed against 
Valium and Librium, the drugs most com- 
monly used in suicide attempts, has under- 
gone preliminary successful human testing. 
The antidote, called Anexate, could be used 
to save hundreds of lives each year (Chicago 
Tribune, 11/3/85). 



Jumping from high buildings or bridges is 
another method of suicide for which inter- 
vention may be possible. Access to high 
buildings could be limited, physical bar- 
ricades such as high glass or steel fences could 
be required above a specified height and win- 
dows above a certain story could be made un- 
openable or unbreakable. However, since 
the number of suicides among young people 
which occur by this method are few, the im- 
pact of the interventions probabfy would not 
be great. The causes of youth suicide appear 
to be enormously far-reaching and deeply en- 
meshed in societal problems. The building of 
barriers on buildings and bridges would not 
seem to make a dent in the problem. 

What can we do to reduce these alarming 
statistics? Perhaps the most important pos- 
sibility for intervention is to conduct school 
programs in positive mental health education 
for students, teachers and parents. These 
programs must begin with helping children to 
develop self-esteem, and communication 
and listening skills. Then kids can learn how 
to identify a child in trouble and how to reach 
him. They must know whom to turn to in the 
school to get help and when to turn to a 
professional. They need programs in stress 
management and coping skills as well as 
programs in suicide prevention. School 
faculty need to know wh(*t to do in the event 
that someone in the school does attempt or 
commit suicide to prevent one suicide from 
becoming multiple suicides. 

Educational intervention is difficult to 
evaluate because of the absence of data. 
Over a period of years, however, education 
would appear to have the best potential for 
decreasing self-inflicted mortality. Here I 
use the analogy of sanitation and its effects 
on infectious disease. More lives have been 
saved by preventive sanitation than by an- 
tibiotics. Based on studies of the effects of 
public education in the areas of child abuse, 
discrimination, and drunk driving, self-in- 
flicted mortality for children and adolescents 
could be reduced by as much as 20 percent 
through public education (Holinger, 1984).

HIGH RISK POPULATIONS 

Psychiatric patients and suicide attempters 

The major focus of this paper is on adoles- 
cents in the general population. However, it 
is well documented that psychiatric patients 
and those who have previously attempted 
suicide have a far greater rate of completed 
suicide than that of the general population 
(Pokorny, 1983; Sainsbuky, 1982). Thus, 
they must be considered. Can our 
knowledge of their high risk be used for 
prevention? Kreitman (1982) has shown 
that if we were to screen a large high-risk 
population we would catch relative^ few 
suicides at high expense. If one concentrates 
on a smaller high-risk group, the yield is so 
low that the overall reduction in the total 
number of suicides is minimal. 

What other possibilities can be considered? 
The first is training of psychiatrists, 
psychologists, physicians, nurses, and other 
mental health professionals to be increasing- 
ly aware of the risk of this group. 

Another fruitful avenue is that of biochemi- 
cal research. Specific biochemical tests are 
being developed to establish the potential of 
patients with biochemical disorders such as 
decreased serotonin levels for the propensity 
to impulsive, violent behaviors including 
suicide (Van Praag, 1982). 

A third possibility involves the use of the 
agents of suicide, particularly guns and 
medications. Stricter regulations of gun sales 
and medications are needed, especially to 
previous suicide attempters and persons with 
histories of psychiatric hospitalization. 

Juveniles in Jails and detention centers 

Another group of youngsters with a high rate 
of suicide are adolescents held in jails and 
juvenile detention centers. One example of 
practical intervention is the program that the 
Samaritans of Boston have instituted. Each 
week, volunteers meet with the inmates of 
the Charles Street Jail where they have 
trained thirty inmates to be "barred 
befrienders" to help identify the suicidal 



3-292 



among the 5000 new arrivals to the jail each 
year. Since the program began there have 
been six suicides at Charles Street, rather 
than the fifty-six that the National Institute 
of Justice statistics indicate normally happen 
in an institution of its size. In addition, of- 
ficer training in suicide prevention is now re- 
quired by the State of Massachusetts. How 
effective this training will be in the preven- 
tion of youthful suicide should be evaluated. 

Another area of risk for youth is in juvenile 
detention centers. Youngsters are brought 
here, often on a first offense such as a drunk 
driving charge, to wait for a parent. They arc 
placed in a cell and left alone. Sometimes 
there is a television monitor for surveillance. 
I would rather recommend the use of other 
inmates for surveillance rather than an in- 
animate object, and further would recom- 
mend the holding of these youths in cells with 
another person present rather than alone. 
Often these kids are humiliated and 
frightened, and isolation is the last thing we 
want for them. These procedures are simple 
to institute and they may help to reduce the 
death toll for a select high-risk population.

SCHOOl^BASED PREVENTION PROGRAMS

University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, Minnesota 



INTRODUCTION 

As the statistics on youthful suicide rise 
dramatically^ prevention of youth suicide has 
become a priority of professionals involved 
with community-based facilities. Suicide 
prevention centers, crisis hotlines, family 
physicians, and teachers are just some of the 
different community resources available to 
help the suicidal individual. The efficacy of 
these various individuals and programs has, 
however, been subject to question. Con- 
troversy still continues about whether suicide 
prevention centers and agencies, 
psychologists and psychotherapists can ac- 
tually prevent suicide (Bagl^, 1968; Jen- 
nings, Barraclough and Moss, 1978; Innes, 
1980). Other studies, speciOcally those ex- 
amining the role of suicide prevent* 
centers, similarly have found conflicvuife 
results (Weiner, 1968; Lester, 1974; Miller, 
Coombs, Leeper, Barton, 1984). Overall, 
however, suicide prevention centers may 
have some beneficial effects especially in 
diminishing the rate of suicide in young white 
females (i.e., women and girls 24 years of age 
or younger). 

Recently, suicide prevention programs and 
curricula have been developed for junior and 
senior high schools. These programs have 
assumed various tasks but have as their over- 
all goal the prevention of suicide by the stu* 
dents enrolled in school All of the current 
programs utilize some of the ideas of a com- 
prehensive school-based prevention 
program. Unfortunately, serious omissions 
occur in many of these programs. In review- 



ing this field, it is apparent that nine aspects 
of prevention programs must be developed 
and integrated into the different school- 
based programs. They are: 

1. Early identification and screening. 

2. Comprehensive and thorough evaluation 
of the depressed, suicidal, and psychiatri- 
cally disturbed young person. 

3. Crisis intervention and case management. 

4. Programs immediately following a suicide. 

J. Education for students, teachers, com- 
munity, and professionals on identifica- 
tion, diagnosis, and management of 
suicidal youth. 

6. Monitoring and followup. 

7. Community linkage and networking. 

8. Research of epidemiology, causation, and 
longitudirtal foUowup of attempters. 

9. Advocacy. 

This paper reviews the existing youth suicide 
prevention programs developed for schools 
and elaborates on some of the more critical 
aspects of the nine components of a sys- 
tematic protocol that would comprise an ef- 
fective prevention program. 

The general purpose of a successful school- 
based program should be to integrate an un- 
derstanding of the risk factors for youth 
suicide, an appreciation of the behaviora! 
characteristics and clinical symptomatology 
of the suicidal individual, and an awareness

of the various psychosocial stressors with 
which the suicidal adolescent is attempting to 
cope. The synthesis of these three functions 
forms the basis of suicide curricula for 
schools. 

This review of existing youth suicide preven- 
tion curricula was undertaken by the Greater 
Lakes Mental Health Foundation in 
Tacoma, Washington. The review commit- 
tee consisted of educators, physicians, 
psychologists and community workers. A 
review of 19 programs revealed that only five 
curricula received an overall pc^itive rating. 
Some programs had specific deficiencies 
when rated on a four point scale examining 
four aspects of the prevention curriculum. 
The four areas critiqued were: coping skills, 
prevention, intervention, and postvention. 

EARLY IDENTIFICATION AND 
SCREENING 

The question of "what do we screen for?" 
arises in training educators and school ad- 
ministrative staff to screen for suicidal youth. 
Does the screening include an examination 
for depression, antisocial behaviors and at- 
titudes, impulsiveness, suicidal intent, hope- 
lessness, coping skills, family background, 
and psychosocial stressors? Should evalua- 
tion include all these areas? Three general 
areas of early identification and screening 
that must be examined are: 

1. Identification of depression in young 
people, 

Z Appreciation of the various psychosocial 
stressors affecting students, and 

3. Methods of responding to and handling 
difHcult problems. 

Early identification is dependent on observ- 
ing the various risk factors associated with at- 
tempted and completed suicide in youth. 
Risk factors i ' . itified by Hawton (1982) and 
Garfinkel, Froese, and Hood (1982) are: 

1. older adolescent, 

2. male, 



3. previous attempts, 

4. chemical dependency (alcoholism) in the 
family, 

5. family breakdown, 

6. deteriorating school performance, 

7. recent antisocial acts (characterized by 
rage, aggression, and impulsiveness), 

8. living away from the family, 

9. history of depression. 

In a 1986 study of suicide attempts in high 
school students, GarHnkel et al. (1986) 
showed that attempters had more than twice 
the number of psychosocial stressors within 
a six-month period prior to their attempts 
than normal adolescents. The various stress- 
ful events were not just more frequent, but 
were qualitatively distinct from the stressful 
events in non-attempters. For example, 
family breakdown, divorce, and school-based 
di^iculties were far more frequent in the 
attempter's group. 

Common stressors experienced by adoles- 
cents who attempt suicide include: 

1. Breakup with boyfriend or girlfriend. 

2. Trouble with brother or sister. 

3. Change in parents' financial status. 

4. Parental divorce. 

5. Losing a close friend. 

6. Trouble with teacher. 

7. Changing to a new school. 

8. Personal injury or other physical illness. 

9. Failing grades. 

lOIncreased arguments with parents. 

Although more than fifty events could be 
identified as upsetting to an adolescent, 
these ten were reported most often by the at- 
tempters. The stressful life events are 
ranked in order of frequency that adoles- 
cents attempting suicide identiOed as most to 
least stressful of the ten most troubling 
events (Garfinkel, et al., 1986).

Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



Suicide attempten in a high school setting 
demonstrate not only depression, but also 
behaviors characterise by: 

1. Angry and explosive outbursts. 

2. Passive withdrawal into drinking, smoking, 
and drug usage. 

3. Avoidant types of behavior including hy- 
persomnia, joyriding, and infrequent com- 
munication with adults. 

4. Recent antisocial behaviors such as fight- 
ing, violent outbursts, stealing, and van- 
dalism. 

5. Visits to family doctors concerning depres- 
sion. 

6. Deteriorating school work. 

Recently, Garfmkel, Hoberman, Parsons, 
and Walker screened 4,267 junior and senior 
high school students in rural Minnesota. 
They examined five symptom and behavioral 
areas: 

• Depression 

• Antisocial behavior 

• Life stressors 

• Familial and demographic factors 

• Coping and adaptive strategies 



Hopelessness and nihilism were not 
evaluated. Information concerning suicide 
attempts, ideation, and impact of role models 
were also assessed and shown to be important 
in determining suicide attempts. Instrumen- 
tation for this type of screening and early 
identification is relatively simple and brief. 
Self-report questionnaires and rating scales 
were the most efficient way of obtaining this 
information. The Beck Depression Inven- 
tory; Berilson Rating Scale for Depression; 
A-COPE, Johnson and McCutchen Life 
Events Questionnaire, demographic, 
familial, and antisocial questions were shown 
to have validity. By applying this information 
to specific students, it is possible to identify 
an individual undergoing severe stress. A 
pattern emerges that often resembles that of 



a suicidal adolescent who has a sufiGcient 
number of pre^sting risk factors to warrant 
a further comprehensive evaluation. 

COMPREHENSIVE 
EVALUATION 

Following the screening measures, some stu- 
dents will be identified as needing further 
evaluation. The comprehensive assessment 
and evaluation of a student attending a junior 
or senior high school must be based on a 
structured systematic psychiatric protocol. 
This should include a structured psychiatric 
diagnostic interview, self and clinician 
ratings, and psychometric testing. The 
evaluation must utilize existing instruments 
that have a high degree of validity and 
reliability. Because depression reflects a 
temporary and episodic state, most rating 
scales and instruments for evaluating depres- 
sion do not have a high test/retest reliability. 
There are, however, a number of structured 
psychiatric interviews that are effective in 
identifying depression, including: 

• Kiddie SADS 

• DICA, (individual and parent) 

• DISC, (Diagnostic Intervdew Schedule 
for Children) (individual and parent) 



Clinician ratings such as the Children's 
Depression Rating Scale by Poznanski 
demonstrate good psychometric properties. 
In addition, self-report ratings such as the 
Children Depression Inventory (CDI) 
(Kovacs, 1978, Birelson, 1978) and the Beck 
Depression Inventory, (Beck, 1979) are 
worthwhile as well as parental ratings for 
depression. Psychological tests such as the 
Personality Inventory for Children (PIC), 
the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality In- 
ventory (MMPI), and the Million Personality 
Profile for Adolescents can be usefully ap- 
plied to the evaluation of suicidal youth. 
Often in a school setting, the evaluation team 
must obtain both parental and teacher 
evaluations of the student and examine the 
difficulties being identified in as many set-

tings as possibte. Weinberg (1973) showed 
that between 40-60 percent of all learning 
disabled children met diagnc»tic criteria for 
depression. 

It is also important to measure hopelessness 
ar.d suicidal intent. Suicidal intentions are 
measurable with instruments such as the 
Beck (1974) or Pierce Scales (1981). The 
Beck Hopelessness Scale has been shown to 
be a very good predictor of completed suicide 
in individuals who have made a previous at- 
tempt (Beck et al., 1985). 

Evaluation should include a thorough assess- 
ment of an individual who had already made 
one suicide attempt. A number of charac- 
teristics of the attempt indicate how serious 
the attempt was and the probability of an 
individuals' ultimately committing suicide. 
The following characteristics, originally sug- 
gested by Beck (lv74), Hawton and dtalan 
(1982), and Garfinkel, Froese, and Hood 
(1982), are good predictors of the serious- 
ness of a previous attempt. 

1. whether others were near by 

2. the likelihood of being rescued 

3. precautions taken to avoid discovery 

4. actions that indicate that death was likely 
(e.g., giving away one's most prized posses- 
sions) 

5. intricate and extensive suicidal plans 

6. leaving a suicide note 

7. not telling others of the attempt following 
the self-destructive actions 

8. informing others of the attempt before it 
actually occurs 

9. family history of suicide 

CRISIS INTERVENTION- 
A MODEL 

Barteolucci and Drayer (1973) and Ha>\lon 
and Catalan (1982) recommend a crisis inter- 
vention model based on brief, collaborative 
problem-solving therapy emphasizing the 
rapid resumption of control over one's en- 
vironmental future. Various personnel in- 



iide and outside the school system, may be ef- 
fective in working with crisis intervention 
teams based within schools. The following 
individuals may be asked to provide a con 
sultation or act as a liaison: 

• child and adolescent psychiatrist 

• school psychologist 

• nurse 

• social worker 

• teacher 

• principal 

• speech patholo^jist 

• occupational therapist 

• coach 

• audiologist 

• pediatric neurologist 

• clergy 

Depending on the unique aspects of a case, 
these diverse individuals may be asked to 
consult or become a permanent member of 
the suicide prevention team. The role of 
psychotropic medication should be examined 
critically because it may be useful in treating 
an immediate crisis (Hawton and Catalan, 
1982). In general, the purpose of the suicide 
team is to transform, for the depressed and 
suicidal adolescent, an environment that, 
until the crisis, had only emphasized 
academics and athletics. The team should 
provide a very supportive, concerned, and 
empathetic group of individuals prepared to 
work with the individual to alleviate 
psychological and social stress. 

One of the chief responsibilities of school - 
based suicide prevention teams should be to 
insure that an adolescent receives the neces- 
sary psychotherapy and social work following 
a suicide attempt. It is important to establish 
immediately an integrated network of 
parents, community-based professionals, and 
school-based educators and counselors. 
Often the early crisis intervention work done 
with the school will determine how success- 
ful subsequent community-based counseling 



311 



3-297 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



will be. If the rapport and therapeutic al- 
liance established with the school-based per- 
sonnel is effective, it is likely that community 
work will also replicate that positive pattern. 

GOALS OF INTERVENTION 
AFTER A SUICIDE 

As outlined by Hawton (1982) and Beck, 
Schuyller, and Herman (1974), a number of 
specific goals should be set and accomplished 
during the crisis-intervention work with an 
adolescent who has attempted suicide. 
Catalan et al. (1980) and Hawton and Gaths 
(1979) demonstrated that all disciplines, in- 
cluding social workers, counselors, 
psychologists, nurses, and psychiatrists can 
assess the individual who has attempted 
suicide. They clearly indicate that the diag- 
nostic assessment of every adolescent at- 
tempter need not involve only one discipline. 
The goals of the assessment are as follows: 

1. Establish a therapeutic alliance. 

2. Determine the type of psychosocial stres- 
sors the individual had been experiencing. 

3. Rule out the presence or absence of a 
psychiatnc disorder. 

4. Identify the adaptive and coping 
mechanisms that the individual uses to 
manage stress. 

5. Determine all the external resources and 
support personnel and systems within the 
individual's life that can be called on to 
help. 

6. Identify what further help the person is 
willing to accept in order to stop the 
suicidal behavior. 

The first step of this protocol is to determine 
all the events that immediately preceeded 
the attempt. In general, a thorough history 
of the preceeding 48 hours is essential. 
Events during the two days are reviewed with 
the individual to determine whether or not 
some could be viewed as a precipitant, or per- 
ceived by the individual as a reason for self- 
destructive behavior. If no psychosocial 
stressors are identified and the suicide at- 



tempt appears to have no reasonable event 
causing it, then it becomes very important 
that a psychiatric disorder be ruled out. Most 
often, when no psychosocial stressors or ob- 
vious reasons for the self-destructive actions 
are apparent, the suicide attempt is a direct 
outgrowth of a psychiatric disorder. 

An evaluation of the degree of hopelessness, 
suicidal risk, and lethality of the actions must 
occu' next. The circumstances of the at- 
tempt indicate how lethal and serious the be- 
havior was. Garfinkel, Froese, and Hood 
(1982) and Beck et al. (1974) described fea- 
tures of attempted suicides that are impor- 
tant to identify: 

• Was the attempt made in isolation? 

• Were others nearby and likely and able 
to intervene? This is necessary to find 
out because efforts to avoid discovery or 
to conceal the attempt indicate level of 
severity. 

• Were there actions that showed the per- 
son anticipated death? Giving away 
one's most valued possessions is informa- 
tion about severity often provided by 
friends. 

• Was a suicide note left? 

• What was the extent of premeditation 
and planning? 

• What method of self-destruction was 
chosen? Jumping, hanging, and drown- 
ing are more lethal and serious than drug 
overdoses and wrist laceration. 

Following an attempt, it is useful to have the 
adolescent list with the person doing the 
evaluation, all his/her difficulties. In order of 
frequency, identifiable problems emerge and 
include the following: 

• problems with boyfiiend or girlfriend 

• problems with parents. 

• problems of a non-specific nature within 
the family. 

• problems that are school-based. 



3-298 



312 



B.Garflnkel: School-based Prevention Programs 



Hawton,0'Orady et al. (1982) demonstrated 
a similar list of problem areas in 50 adoles- 
cents who had attempted suicide, including 
parental, school, peer, social, physical, 
sexual, and alcohol based difficulties. It is im- 
portant to note that such difficulties may, in 
fact, be a consequence of depression rather 
th'*n a cause. They may also perpetuate a 
person's pessimistic view of himself and his 
future. Moreover, they may also have 
precipitated the crisis or the decision to end 
one's life. 

After identifying existing problems and 
psychosocial stressors, the next step involves 
the identification of a possible psychiatric 
disorder. Identifying cognitive problems is as 
important as identifying affective disorders. 
For children and adolescents it is known that 
individuals with learning disabilities, brain 
dysfunctions, and severe depressions may 
have marked cognitive changes. It is also 
known that individuals with depression have 
cognitive distortions and altered attributes 
that affect thought content. At this step in- 
dividuals assessing the patient can do a full 
mental status examination, emphasizing an 
evaluation of both mood and thought disor- 
ders. 

The next component of the evaluation em- 
phasizes identifying family psychopathology, 
family dynamics, and external resources 
available to the suicide attempter. Research 
has indicated that significant psychopathol- 
ogy in family members, especially alcoholism 
and family breakdown, are frequently as- 
sociated with adolescent suicide attempts. 
General psychopathology in other family 
members should be documented noting 
whether another family member has tried to 
commit suicide. Suicide attempts and com- 
pleted suicide in other family members are 
associated with suicidal behavior in adoles- 
cents. Dynamic issues are also important, 
especially in determining the help young per • 
sons can expect from individuals in the im- 
mediate environment. Because family 
members may have coped with severe 
problems for a long period of time, they may 
not be accommodating to the adolescent's 



present crisis. They may take a veiy reject- 
ing, uncooperative altitude. They may also 
treat the child as if he/she were "expendable," 
i.e., they are so tired of the long-standing con- 
flicts that they have "given up" on the 
person's ever getting better. Without suffi- 
cient resources available to the attempter, 
closer observation such as day hospital and 
full hospitalization may be necessary. 

The adaptive and coping mechanisms of the 
attempter should be explored. It is impor- 
tant to determine whether the attempter is 
showing the commonly observed behavior cf 
individuals who attempt suicide: passive 
withdrawal, avoidant behavior, irritable and 
angry responses, and impulsive/explosive an- 
tisocial actions. At this stage of evaluation, 
previous suicide attempts, ruminations, and 
plans should be identified. Finally, all sup- 
portive relationships must be identified; they 
can include peers, family members, clergy, 
educators, and professionals. It is important 
that the evaluator not keep the suicidal be- 
havior strictly confidetitial. If intentions are 
kept secret, adolescents with suicidal idea- 
tion may not be adequately monitored or 
managed in all settings, and could result in a 
fatality. 

The last step is to establish a contract. The 
individual who has attempted suicide agrees 
to work on specific problems with identified 
external resources without turning to suicide 
during a specified period of time, usually 
three to four months. Often, three to four 
months is necessary to allow for sufficient 
mood elevation, cognitive reorganization 
with new attribjtes, and the resolution of 
various psychosocial stressors to deter the in- 
dividual from further suicidal behavior. 

SURVIVING A CHILD OR 
ADOLESCENT SUICIDE 

Following a suicide, educators and com- 
munity workers have difficulty managing and 
counseling relatives, peers, and classmates of 
the individual who committed suicide. A 
number of principles should be adhered to 
within the school setting that would deem- 



313 



3-299 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



phasize the social learning and role modeling 
that can occur following a suicide. All sub- 
sequent actions should be handled in a very 
sensitive manner deemphasizing, but ac- 
knowledging the presence of guilt, respon- 
sibility and anger. Only two basic principles 
underpin this type of work; first, preventing 
social modeling from occurring, and second, 
preventing negathre feeling;! of guilt, respon- 
sibility, and anger from overwhelming the 
survivors. 

A number of tasks should be carried out in 
the school that are directed to both school 
friends as well as the general student body. 
Following an attempt or completed suicide, 
approximately one-third of the student body 
will have already heard about it indirectly. 
Educators therefore, should not think that by 
discussing what has occurred, they are ghdng 
young people the idea that suicide is an op- 
tiou. The students can be encouraged to ex- 
plore with adults the sense of loss and 
abandonment regarding the suicide. Herzog 
and Resnik (1967) indicated that both the 
parents and peers may have difficulty in com- 
municating openly about the individual who 
committed suicide and may neeu support, 
direct encouragement, and time set aside to 
discuss it. 

Individuals working with peers of the suicide 
should attempt to stress the psychopathology 
that the individual was experiencing. 
Adolescents often believe the individual who 
committed suicide did not have any 
problems whatsoever. Occasionally this is 
true, however, more often the psychopathol- 
ogy was minimized or not readify apparent. 
Stressing the psychopathological elements in 
the individual's functioning demystifies the 
suiciuc, emphasizes emotional and mental 
disturbances, and makes it more difficult to 
identify with the dead individual. A major 
component in working with the survivors is 
to break down the identification with the in- 
dividual who committed suicide. Emphasiz- 
ing family and other problems unique to the 
individual and deemphasizing the strengths 
the individual possessed are methods by 
which identification can be diminished. Em- 



phasizing psychosocial stressors such as 
academic difficulties, breakup of peer 
relationships, and physical issues that were 
stressful events in the individual's life, places 
the suicide in the context of a unique set of 
circumstances. By sharing the unique 
aspects, other students have a more difficult 
time in identifying with the decedent. Fur- 
thermore, professionals and educators work- 
ing with the students should deemphasize 
suicide as the cause of death. In fact, some 
professionab do not mention suicidn at all 
but emphasize depression and various other 
stressors as leading to the individual's suicide. 

Peers, classmates and family members should 
be encouraged to limit the extent of 
memorializing the decedent. Although not 
fully researched in a controlled fashion, some 
empirical evidence suggests that individuals 
who memorialize a suicide do so in a much 
more elaborate fashion compared to a similar 
age person dying from other causes. 

Finally, coming to terms with the loss and 
abandonment must be explored. Survivors 
have great difficulty in comprehending 
suicide as permanent and volitional. These 
two particular aspects (i.e. volitional and per- 
manent) of the decedent's actions should be 
discussed. In general, ventilation of anger 
with the decedent ("he was no different from 
the survivors"), responsibility and guilt, and 
non-specific communication are not the most 
effective ways of trying to limit the social 
modeling and the potential for clustering of 
suicides. 

EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS 
AND SCHOOL PERSONNEL 

Educational programs to develop sensitivity 
and awareness of the issues of youth suicide 
abound for students, teachers, and ad- 
ministrative school personnel. Educational 
programs vary in duration, content, and per- 
sonnel. The major components of various 
programs are four-fold and usually include 
coping skills, prevention, intervention, and 
postvention. 

Some programs have been as brief as one

B.Qarflnkel: School-based Prevention Programs 



class period and others have grown to as 
many as 3 to 5 classes. No one has been able 
to demonstrate that programs directed to 
students have any direct beneHt. Similarly, 
no evidence suggests that programs for 
school personnel are effective. It is possible 
that general discussions about suicide may 
have a deleterious el^ect on the students in 
that the topic may inadvertantly become 
idealized and appealing. 

STUDY OF EDUCATIONAL 
PROGRAMS IN MINNESOTA 

Garfmkel, Hoberman, Walker, and Parsons 
examined suicide educational programs in 
rural Minnesota high schools which were 
directed to either students or educational 
personnel. They wished to determine if 
educational programs correlated with either 
the suicide attempt rate for that particular 
school or the occurrence of severe depres- 
sion. The ten schools studied had six suicide 
attempts within the six months prior to the 
beginning of the study. Beck Depression In- 
ventories were completed on 200 students 
designated for this study. Students in grades 
9, 10, 11, and 12 in a particular class were 
asked to fill out the Beck Depression Rating 
Scale, provide other information such as 
suicide information, demographic data, and 
coping and life stress events schedules. Prin- 
cipals were interviewed to determine the 
number of educational programs on suicide, 
depression, or stress that the school 
provided. They were also asked whether 
specific personnel within the school were 
designated to give these educational 
programs and whether or not experts were 
brought in. The range of programs varied 
from 0-4. 

Whether educational programs were 
provided did not correlate with either the 
suicide attempt rate in a particular school or 
with the occurrence or severity of depression 
recorded. The type of speaker, (by dis- 
cipline, or an outside expert, or someone on 
faculty) also did not have an impact on the 
rate of suicide or depression. Similarly, the 
number of suicide education programs or 



number of staff persons did not have a sig- 
nificant effect on these two variables. 

This is a pilot study that will be replicated in 
forty more schools. The programs may be 
criticized on the basis that the philosophy or 
approach was not knov.'n. It is encouraging 
to note that in spite of media attention to 
suicide and the social learning and modeling 
that can occur when suicide is discussed 
generally, these programs did not have an en- 
hancing effect on the suicide and depression 
rate within the schools that we studied. 
Therefore, one can cautiously conclude from 
these preliminary fmdings that a nonstandar- 
dized educational program within a school 
setting directed to students and teachers is 
not associated with an increase in suicide at- 
tempts or severe depression within a par- 
ticular high school. 

When the Greater Lakes Mental Health 
Foundation critically reviewed youth suicide 
prevention curricula, they identified four 
components of the student and teacher cur- 
ricula: coping skills, prevention, interven- 
tion, and postvention. Nevertheless, the 
programs that were critically reviewed had 
multiple omissions from the reviewer's 
perspective. 

The curriculum that received the highest 
rating was developed by Thomas C. Barrett, 
Ed., entitled, "Youth in Crisis, Seeking Solu- 
tions to Self-Destructive Behavior". It con- 
sists of 255 pages dealing with prevention and 
intervention models for the school and com- 
munity. A five-lesson curriculum is provided 
along with exercise and resource material ac- 
companying the lessons. My review of this 
material is more critical and I have identified 
a number of shortcomings: 

1. The overall model is vague and is overly 
sociological and anthropological with a 
deemphasis on mental disorders as a cause 
of youth suicide. 

2. The bibliography is far too brief and not 
current. 

3. The mental health team does not include 
psychiatry. 



3-301 



Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide 



4. The student curriculum spends most of its 
time examining the issues and circumstan- 
ces sunounding suicide itself, with a deem- 
phasis on depression. 

5. The model of suicide emphasizes societal 
factors and does not integrate or em- 
phasize psychology. 

Herbert of the Fairfax County, Virginia 
Public Schools has produced "A Guide to 
Adolescent Suicide Prevention Programs 
Within the School". This SS-page booklet 
summarizes the major characteristics of 
suicide educational programs based within 
schools and communities. It has a balanced 
perspective that identifies depression as 
being a significant factor in youth suicide. It 
has not been demonstrated, at this time, 
whether these particular programs have an 
ameliorative e^ect on suicide and depression 
within school settings. It also has not been 
shown whether these types of programs are 
inadvertantly providing role models to al- 
ready depressed individuals and guiding 
more people to attempt suicide. 

Many of the educational models for students 
emphasize more effective adaptation, coping 
sicills, and communication among teenagers. 
The program that has developed these 
educational areas most systematically is the 
Suicide Prevention Center in Dayton, Ohio. 
They have produced five separate teacher 
manuals that deal with various aspects of 
depression and suicide. The most useful of 
the manuals emphasizes stress management, 
i.e., coping skills, instead of focusing on the 
topic of suicide. It is not known whether it is 
more helpful to discuss depression, coping 
mechanisms, or more effective communica- 
tion than to avoid bringing suicide to the 
classroom directly to the students attention. 

Most educational programs encourage the 
development of early self recognition of 
depression. Self-identiflcation and iden- 
tification of depression in one's peers appear 
to be worthwhile skills to teach students. 
Emphasizing depression rather than suicide 
appears to be an effective way of focusing on 
a phenomenon associated with suicide. Ex- 



amining ineffective coping styles, as well as 
more effective coping mechanisms is a very 
useful and practical educational strategy for 
students. Learning to deemphasize passive 
withdrawal, avoidant types of behaviors, al- 
cohol and drug use, anger, and antisocial be- 
haviors is important. Emphasizing 
networking and the integration of adult 
guidance into the youth's support system are 
worthwhile skills with which to train and edu- 
cate our high school students. Reinforcing 
assertive and clear communication is also a 
worthy goal of educational programs. Deem- 
phasizing the rageful forms of communica- 
tion and the indirect methods that are 
commonly seen ' suicidal youth are also 
being brought to the attention of the stu- 
dents. At this time, it is not known whether 
educational programs emphasizing these is- 
sues will alter either coping or communica- 
tion in depressed and suicidal individuals. 

COMMUNITY UNKAGE AND 
NETWORKING 

School suicide prevention teams can become 
a community link to other school districts, 
high schools, community mental health 
centen, hospitals, universities, churches, and 
private mental health practitioners. The 
legal system, including tiuant officers, proba- 
tion officers, and community police officers 
frequently can be included. Community net- 
working includes determining what com- 
munity-wide educational programs are 
available. Networking deals with the media 
and guides them to deemphasize the 
coverage of suicides when they occur and to 
ests'olish foUowup, aftercare management 
and treatment networks to serve young 
people after a crisis or suicide attempt. 
Often the suicide prevention team within the 
school must interact with parents, siblings, 
children, and adolescents who are especially 
vulnerable to depression and suicide. The 
prevention team should worK with youth in 
health, recreational, and social areas and in 
the exchange of expertise among all groups 
addressing this problem. The linkage serves 
as a prevention, crisis intervention, and re-

search base for the enhancement of scientific 
and clinical knowledge about youth suicide. 

RESEARCH 

Applying the model outlined above, the 
University of Minnesota Division of Child 
and Adolescent Psychiatry and the Agricul- 
tural Extension Program in the Department 
of Home Economics, in association with the 
4-H Gubs of Minnesota, established a broad 
community-based study of youth suicide at- 
tempts in rural Minnesota. The study in- 
cluded 52 counties in three regions of rural 
Minnesota. It surveyed 82 schools and in- 
volved 65 agricultural extension agents. 
Over 4,267 students were surveyed and their 
information provided data on: 

• demographic characteristics of suicide 
attempters. 

• the prevalence of suicide attempts in 
rural Minnesota youth. 

• stressful life events. 

• coping and adaptive skills. 

• a self-rating scale for depression. 

• an inventory of antisocial behaviors. 

Research of this type was only possible with 
the help of an extensive network of profes- 
sionals working with the schools in collabora- 
tion with community resources. It utilized 
existing networks and teams within and out- 
side our junior and senior high schools. 
Other research taking place within schools 
that has examined affective disorders in 
suicide included a study of the prevalence of 
Seasonal Affective Disorders in high school 
students. 

MONITORING AND FOLLOWUP 

Because of the unique function of schools 
that keep all children below the age of 16 in 
school eight hours a day, five day^^ a week, stu- 
dents in a junior high school and the ;;arly 
grades of senior high school are much more 
available for monitoring and foUowup pur- 



poses. Unlike adults who have made a 
serious suicide attempt or gesture, and whose 
diverse vocational and social functioning 
make it difficult to determine their com- 
pliance with recommended management 
proit^rams, children and adolescents can be 
followed within the schools by a suicide 
prevention team and the school team can 
monitor community-based treatment 
programs. Because individuals who attempt 
suicides are at high risk for ultimately com- 
pleting suicide or making multiple attempts, 
it is imperative to monitor these individuals 
closely. Monitoring and supervising the 
progress of individuals who have been iden- 
tified as individuals at risk or are involved in 
self-destructive behavior, can be a major 
function of the school-based team. Similarly 
this team is in a unique position to monitor 
community-wide trends regarding suicide, 
community education efforts, media ex- 
ploitation of youth suicide, recent advances 
in suicide research, and specific school trends 
over a number of years. Suicide in a par- 
ticular school can be examined as a function 
of unique local situations and events. 

CONCLUSIONS: THE YOUNG 
PERSON'S ADVOCATE 

The developmt.^; of suicide prevention 
programs and teams within our junior and 
senior high schools results in a number of 
programs being developed. These include: 

• Early identiHcation 

• Comprehensive evaluation 

• Crisis intervention 

• Postvention 

• Education 

• Monitoring 

• Community linkage 

• Research 



Providing these different functi'rns can be ac- 
complished while the students maintain their 
routine and regular activities. The school

program becomes a resource not only for the 
school and district, but for the entire com- 
munity. It becomes a clearinghouse for new 
research, comprehensive management tech- 
niques, and the coordination of community 
education efforts in the area of suicide. 
Moreover, as this team monitors, foUows-up, 
and establishes a registry of individuals at 
highest risk for suicide, it can become the 
children's most effective advocates. School, 
peer and parental attitudes may be insensi- 
tive and unaware of the depressed and 
suicidal individuals who lack the energy, so- 
cial skills, and abilities to deal effectively with 
the usual adolescent developmental 
demands. Having advocates within the 
school setting can provide immediate 
response to difHculties at teacher, peer, 
classmate, and parental levels. Explaining to 
both teachers and parents that a suicidal and 
depressed individual may not be able to con- 
centrate and complete homework and, there- 
fore, punitative actions about incomplete 
assignments, lack of energy, and excessive 
daydreaming may be harmful to an already 
depressed individual. Explaining physical 
ailments and somatic symptoms may also be 
very helpful. As the young persons' advo- 
cate, the prevention team ultimately can 
reframe behavioral, physical, and social 
problems from one perspective to another. 
Rather than observing antisocial behaviors 
entirely within a conduct disorder 
framework, one can also present them as 
adaptive behaviors commonly seen in 
depressed and suicidal individuals. 

The most impoitant beneOt of all is that the 
suicidal student will have an advocate readi- 
ly available eight hours a day who will be 
knowledgeable about the thoughts and feel- 
ings the student is experiencing, able to inter- 
pret the individuals' behavior towards others 
more effectively, and will accomplish these 
tasks in an empathetic fashion to the student. 
It is estimated between 3-6 percent of all 
high school students require the direct ser- 
vices of a suicide prevention team. Not only 
do at-risk students, but all students, teachers, 
and members of the community benefit from 
the diverse activities of this team.
