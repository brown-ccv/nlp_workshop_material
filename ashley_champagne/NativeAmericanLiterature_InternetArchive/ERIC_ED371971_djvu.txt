ABSTRACT 

This serial issue features 6 members of the Indiana 
University System faculty who have focused their research on Latin 
America, past and present. The first article, *'A Literature of Their 
Ovm," highlights Darlene Sadlier's research on Brazilian women's 
fiction and poetry that has led to an interest in the interplay of 
Brazilian and Portuguese literary worlds. The second article explores 
the research of Gordon Brotherston, who has based his studies on 
original Native American texts while focusing on the Nahua-speaking 
cultures of Mexico. The third article discusses Norman Bradley, who 
has used his painting inspired by Mayan art to journey in his 
personal inner world through shape, color, and paint. The fourt 
article discusses the work done by Geoffrey Conrad in San Antonio, 
Peru, in piecing together the elements of the lives of people who 
left no written language. By combining archaeology and ethnohistory 
in the study of later prehistory, Conrad hopos to generate hypotheses 
about the early development of Peruvian civilization. The fifth 
article focuses on K. Anne Pyburn, an anthropologist whose projects 
are founded on the principle of community involvement. While 
attempting to excavate a grouping of Maya ruins in the north central 
region of Belize, she tried to bring about economic benefits for the 
modern village nearby. At the same time, Pyburn hoped to track the 
development of economic classes among the Maya who once inhabited the 
site. The sixth and final article features anthropology professor 
Emilio Moran's study of secondary growth following deforestation in 
the Amazon rain forest. (DK)

Research, both pure and applied, and creative 
activities are ongoing and essential aspects of 
life on the campuses at Indiana University. The 
quality of instructional education at any institution 
is tremendously enhanced if based upon and 
continuously associated with research and creative 
inquiry. It is significant, therefore, that the emphasis 
at iU not only is placed upon fundamental and basic 
research but also is directed tov/ard developmental 
activities designed to discover those applications of 
research that characterize the efforts of many of 
our faculty in the arts and sciences as well as 
the professional schools. 

As an overview of the diverse and interesting 
programs of research, scholarship, and creative 
activities conducted at Indiana University, 
Research & Creative Activity offers its readers an 
opportunity to become familiar with the professional 
accomplishments of our distinguished faculty. 
We hope the articles that appear in Research & 
Creative Activity continue to be intellectually 
stimulating to readers and make them more aware 
of the great diversity and depth of the research and 
artistic creativity underv^'ay at Indiana University. 
A full and exciting life is being created here, now 
and for the future. From our readers we welcome 
suggestions for topics for future articles in Research 
& Creative Activity that will demonstrate further the 
scholarly activity at Indiana University.

From the Editors 



At the end of the third century, civilization 
first arose in the lands now knowii as Mexico, 
Central America, and South America, as well as 
on neighboring islands. At the end of the fifteenth 
century, Europeans invaded these lands, and periods 
of conquest, colonialism, and independence followed. 
Now, at the end of the twentieth century, the nearly 
400 million people imprecisely described as 
Latin Americans face a multitude of cultural and 
environmental challenges. This issue of Research 
& Creative Activity features six members of the Indiana 
University faculty who have focused on Latin America, 
past and present, and shared their findings with us. 

The first article highlights Darlene Sadlier, 
professor of Spanish and Portuguese and adjunct 
professor of women's studies. Sadlier's research in 
Brazilian women's fiction and poetry has led to an 
interest in the interplay of Brazilian and Portuguese 
literary worlds and, recently, an opportunity^ to make 
contacts with Mexican feminist scholars. She has 
continued to challenge lU students to interpret the 
provocative literatures of Brazil and Portugal 
innovatively and in depth. 

Gordon Brotherston, a 1993-94 Guggenheim 
fellow and also a professor of Spanish and Portuguese, 
bases his studies on original Native American texts. 
His main focus is the Nahua-speaking cultures of 
Mexico. Brotherston asks his students to compare 
the experiences and perspectives of Native American 
peoples throughout the Americas. His work is 
helping to define the "vision" of America, 
investigating what literary critics and others 
have said about that vision. 

Norman Bradley, associate professor of fine arts 
at Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne, 
uses his paintings as a means of "taking a journey 
through my own inner world by way of art — shape, 
color, paint." Bradley's visits to Mexico to examine 
Mayan art have inspired his own creative work. 
IPFW art students have also benefitted from Bradley's 
immersion in Latin American and pre-Columbian art. 

Professor of anthropology, chairperson of the 
anthropology department, and director of the William 
Hammond Mathers Museum, Geoffrey Conrad has a 
strong desire to explore a "tangible link to the past." 
In San Antonio, Peru, he and his graduate archaeology 
students have done that by piecing together the 
elements of the lives of people who left no written 
language to speak for them. By combining 
archaeology and ethnohistory in the study of later 
prehistory, Conrad hopes to generate hypotheses 
about the early development of Peruvian civilization. 



For K. Anne Pyburn, assistant professor of 
anthropology at Indiana University-Purdue 
University Indianapolis and research associate at fU 
Bloomington's William Hammond Mathers Museum, 
it is important to consider the interests of the people 
living near archaeological sites. Her projects are 
founded on the principle of community involvement. 
One is a grouping of Maya ruins in the north central 
region of Belize. It is here that Pyburn is attempting 
to excavate the site — previously unknown to the 
outside world — while bringing about economic 
benefits for the nearby village of Crooked Tree. 
At the same time, Pyburn hopes to track the 
development of economic classes among the 
Maya who once inhabited the site. 

The last article features Emilio Moran, professor 
of anthropology, who is using both satellite data and 
detailed information from field research in a study 
of secondary r-^wth following deforestation in the 
Amazon ra^ .orest. Throughout his career Moran 
has comb''" . d social and earth sciences, providing a 
niodel for the interdisciplinary potential of ecological 
research. His research interests have led to the 
creation of the Anthropological Center for Training 
and Research on Global Environmental Change (ACT), 
which he directs. 

Though their intellectual interests are diverse, 
the faculty members in this issue share a connection — 
their devotion both to people and to place. It may be 
hearing the meter of an ancient poem, or seeing the 
light filtering through a canopy of rain forest leaves, 
but some personal experience has captivated each 
scholar whose profile appears on the following pages. 
Reading about their explorations of Latin America, 
we see its immediacy, its value, its beauty, its struggle.

A Literature of Their Own 



I 



Darlcnc j. Sadlicr, Profcsi^or 
of Spn}ii<h a}id Portui^iic^c, 



Imagine yourself on n plane 
bound for Rio Grande do Sui, 
the southernmost state of Brazil. 
After traveling for more than 24 
hours you finally reach the capital, 
Porto Alegre, where you are 
introduced to a group of scholars 
who have come to the airport 
to greet you. They inform you 
that you arc tomorrow's keynote 
speaker at the Federal University. 
Your lecture will be at 8:30 a.m., 
and you will give it in Portuguese. 

While this situation may seem 
nightmarish to many, to Darlene J. 
Sadlier it was "hectic — but fun." 
She gave the early morning lecture 
and soon moved on to visit six 
other Brazilian universities, 
sweeping from south to north 
through a country as large as the 
continental United States, lecturing 
and serving as a keynote speaker 



wherever she went. Young and 
energetic — a lithe whirlwind — 
Sadlier has, since her first 
appointment at Indiana University 
in 1978, fackled this and dozens 
of other academic projects with 
what her colleagues aiid students 
describe as predictable resolve 
and enthusiasm. 

Professor of Spanish and 
Portuguese and adjunct professor 
of women's studies since 1991, 
Sadlier estimates that her research 
time, first largely devoted to 
Brazilian literature, has followed 
a "natural progression" into 
Portuguese literature, culminating 
in what is now a "fifty/fifty 
balance" between the two cultures. 
During the past several semesters 
she has offered graduate and 
undergraduate courses on Brazilian 
literature, women in developing 
countries, contemporary Portugal, 
Latin American cinema, and 
modern Portuguese literature. 



Her most recent books also reflect 
her interest in the literatures of 
both countries. The Question of 
How: Womcu Writers ami Neiv 
Portuj^ucse Literature (1989), 
examines women's fiction since 
the 1974 Portuguese revolution; her 
newest publication is a provocative 
Brazilian anthology. One Mm id red 
Years After Toniorroiv: Brazilian 
Women's Fiction in the 20th Century, 
published in 1992 by Indiana 
University Pre5S. 

It was Brazil that first riveted 
Sadlier's attention, and it is with 
Brazil — and Brazilian women writ- 
ers — that her strongest allegiances 
remain. "Brazil first, and always," 
she says, smiling, when considering 
the scope of her research interests. 
Her attachment to Brazil was 
formed early in her academic 
career, at Kent State University.

As an undorgrndiiato Spanish 
major, Sadlicr leafed through a 
catalog in search of a language 
other than French (which she iiad 
tilready studied) to supplement her 
courses. She came across a small 
section of [Portuguese, and — mostly 
out of curiosity — signed up. hier 
professor, Doris J. Turner, helped 
shape a career for the young 
scholar; years later Sadlier 
dedicated her anthology of 
Brazilian women's twentieth- 
century fiction to her mentor. 
"She was very important to mc," 
Sadlier recalls. "She gave me a 
sense that there was more to being 
a language major than learning the 
language itself." Under Turner's 
guidance, Sadlier wrote an 
undergraduate thesis on the novel 
of social protest in Brazil, earned 
a double major in Spanish and 
Portuguese, and headed off to 
graduate school with a deep 
interest in Brazilian literature. 
Oswald ino Marques, her thesis 
director at the Uni\'ersity of 
Wisconsin, was Brazilian; under 
his direction Sadlier's dissertation 
analyzed the poetry of one of the 
key literary figures in Brazil, 
Cecilia Meireles. Today Sadlier is 
regarded as an expert on the poetry 
of Meireles, the subject of her first 
two books, linn^oy mni Theme in the 
Poetry of Cecilia Meirele$: A StiuUj of 
'Mar Absolitfo' and CeeiVn Meireles e 
lono >4/;^//()//sifs. 

Cecilia Meireles {1901-1964) 
published more than 20 volumes of 
poetry during her lifetime. A.t a 
time when other poets were trying 
highly experimental work, Meireles 
was writing what Sadlier describes 
as "very quiet, private, introspec- 
tive poems." Meireles and novelist 
Raquel de Queiroz (b. 1910) were 
two of only three or four women 
included in the Brazilian literary 
canon in the first decades of the 
twentieth century. Why were so 
few women recognized? And why 
were Meireles and Queiroz singled 
out? 

Answers to these questions 
require, initially, a recognition of 
the political and cultural climate 




Cceiliii Meireles (1901-1964) 
piiblisJieii wore thmi 20 voJnnies of 
poefrif tiitrii}\* her lifetime. 

within which Meireles, Queiroz, 
and other Brazilian women were 
writing. Although a significant 
number of women published their 
work during the first half of the 
twentieth century, most of them 
were unsuccessful in securing a 
reputation. When, for example, 
novelist and critic Amelia 
Bevilaqua was a candidate for a 
chair in the prestigious Brazilian 
Academy of Letters in 1930, the 
academy remained all male, voting 
against a proposal to admit women 
into its membership. During the 
1930s and 1940s, literary critic and 
historian Olivio Montenegro 
assumed that most Brazilian 
women writers were better suited 
to make babies than to write novels. 
Writing in 1938, he offered this 
opinion: 

These are authors more 
faithful to sex than to 
literature. But literature isn't 
the best channel for sex — nor 
the most sound. Rather it's 
maternity that [these writers] 
understand well and from 
which they can benefit. 

Few women writers could have 
garnered Montenegro's praise 
under these conditions. Ironically, 
Montenegro singled out Queiroz, 



whose novels often focused on 
the economic hardships of people 
living in Brazil's remote northeast, 
as worthy of serious study because 
her writing contained traces of 
"a virile perscmality." 

According to Sadlier, Queiroz 
and Meireles also achieved a solid 
reputation because they could be 
understood in terms of the critical 
\'alues of their time. Writing for 
Fiction Inteniatioiwi she explains: 
'The inclusion of Meireles and 
Queiroz in the literary canon seems 
partly based on their ability to fit 
into aesthetic 'movements' already 
sanctioned by criticism; for 
example, scholars generally 
referred to Meireles as a 'post- 
symbolist' poet, and they 
frequently placed Queiroz in the 
tradition of nineteenth-century 
Brazilian regionalism." 

Although these two women had 
found a place in Brazilian literary 
history, their works were not fully 
understood. Sadlier, for example, 
admits limiting her own earlier 
discussions of Meireles's work to 
issues of style. Then, in 1979, the 
Symposium on Hispanic Women: 
Literature, History, Anthropology, 
held in Blooming ton, inspired 
Sadlier to combine her understand- 
ing of Meireles's style with issues of 
gender. Sadlier credits the 
important dialogues that emerged 
at that Indiana University sympo- 
sium as a "turning point" for her 
own research on Meireles, 
helping her to rediscover the poet 
as a woman who addressed the 
question of female identity. 

"People call Meireles a 
post-symbolist," she explains. 
"They say that she is not 
addressing social and political 
issues. But in fact, when you 
look closely at her poetry, you 
see there is obviously an image of 
an introspective woman, trying to 
understand who she is." Sadlier 
cites as an example a disturbing 
Meireles poem, "Ten Dancers in 
the Casino," in which emaciated 
women perform a dance of death 
within the dark and impenetrable 
territory of men — a smoke-filled 
Brazilian bar. 



In the early l%Osanolhor 
Brazilian novelist, Clarice 
Lispector, was gaining critical 
attention in literary journals. IJke 
Meireles and Queiro/, saysSadlier, 
Lispector was described in ways 
that "made her inclusion in the 
canon possible." Some critics 
compared her with modernists 
James Joyce and Virginia WcKiif; 
others saw signs of existentialism 
in her anxiety-tilled middle-class 
characters. After Lispector's death 
in 1977, French critic Helenc Cixcnis 
did much to lurther international 
literary interest in the author. 
Brazil's intellectual lite has long 
been influenced by Franci . Sadlier 
notes, and Cixous's recognition of 
Lispector increased her importance 
in that country as well as in the 
United States, where translations 
and criticism on Lispector abound. 
French feminism and the growing 
importance of women's studies 
in i5razil have contributed to a 
significant increase in the 
publication of novels and stories 
written by women in Brazil. 

These stirrings of literary activity 
closely kilknved an important 
political event, the declaration of 
the United Nations International 
Women's Year in 1^75. This e\'enl, 
says Sadlier, "stimulated the 
discussion of women's issues 
throughout the country." Women 
formed groups and held 
conferences to examine their 
own representatitin in "all facets 
of Brazilian lite, including literature 
and the arts." Two feminist 
newspapers, Not^ Mullkra^ (We 
Women) in Sao Pauki and Hni^il 
M/f/Z/cr (Brazil Women) in 
Londrina, kept wcniien informed 
of activities throughout Brazil. 

Fairther, a gradual return tci 
demiuracy after a decade of what 
Sadlier describes as "intense politi- 
cal repression" in the late 1970s 
gave women the opportunity to 
address contro\'ersial issues "with- 
out fear of governmental reprisal." 
This political breakthrough, called 
abcrtura, offered women in Brazil 
the chance to become more 
involved in the public domain "as 
never before in the history of the 
country. They were articulating 
their concerns about social. 



economic, and pcilitical matters 
and beginning to influence the 
outcome of elections." With 
nbcrtunh she points ouL "feminist 
and working-da; : women's groups 
were gi\'en a space in which to 
organize, to voice their concerns 
regarding the (oppressive policies 
of the military regime, and to 
wage demands forbettei Mcial 
services, including child and 
health care facilities." 

As the climate for women's 
rights improved, Sadlier became 
more and more eager to re\'isit the 
country to which she had devoted 
so much of her academic work. In 
198S she got her chance. Funded 
bv the U.S. Information Agency, 
Sadlier headed to Brazil on what 
she now describes as the most 
important academic mission of her 
career, traveling frcmi the Federal 
University of Rio Ch*ande do Sul in 
the south to the Federal University 
of Paraiba in Joati Pesscia in the 
north in slightly o\'er one month. 

Despite the tour's fast pace, 
Sadlier made lasting contacts with 
feminist scholars throughout Brazil 
In her role as a feminist academic 
specialist, Sadlier brought 
information about the latest 
issues and debates in feminist 
literary criticism and tlieory. Mer 
goal was to pro\'ide an o\'er\'iew of 
the field, and her lectures were 
supplemented by a variety of 
resource materials provided by 
the Indiana Unix'ersity Women's 
Studies Program. In each 
university, scholars were eager 
for information and advice on 
• (blishing women's studies 
programs and developing curricula 
and bibliographies. "In some 
areas, such as the northeast, the 
economic situation is very poor/* 
says Sadlier. "The scholars that I 
met were working under \'ery 
difficult circumstances. They had 
few books. Sometimes they didn't 
even have paper." 

Sadlier's tour of Brazil also 
brought her in contact with a 
British scholar, Maggie Humm, 
sent from England on an academic 
tour similar to Sadlier's. The two 
were struck by the extraordinary 
effort that Brazilian scholars were 
making to promote outstanding 




The "Three Marian" — Porf //yi/csc xvriter^—frotn kfi to ri^^ht

femii I research in a country 
with l,(lt)0 percent annual inflation. 
According to Humm, imported 
books were "priced at the 
equivalent of a Brazilian 
teacher's weekly salary." 

After they returned to their own 
countries, Sadlier and Humm 
collaborated on a volume of Ilction 
Internatioiuil that was de\'Oted to 
literature and issues inx'olving 
wtimen from dex'eloping countries. 
The research that Sadlier did for 
this volume, published in 1990, also 
formed the basis for her 1992. 
anthology of twentieth-century 
l^razilian women's fiction. 

"Once the volume for Fietion 
liiternatioaal was finished," Sadlier 
recalls, "1 thought that there really 
wasn't a btiok in print that gave a 
sense of women's writing in Brazil. 



8 





Fernando Pessoa as "himself" 



I felt thnt it was important 
to produce one." Sndlier's 
Brazilian anthology brings 
together 20 authors, arranged 
chronologically from Carmen 
Dolores, writing in 1907, to Sonia 
Coutinho, writing in 1983. The 
women address topics that range 
from marriage, female identity, 
class values, and economic 
hardship to sexuality, lesbianism, 
and erotica. "At the very least," 
Sadlier states in her introduction, 
"1 expect readers in the United 
States will find the anthology 
informative. The writings 
collected here have never before 
been published in English. Of the 
twenty authors represented, all but 
two or three are virtually unknown 
in North America, and a few have 
been forgotten in Brazil." 

Sadlier's anthology introduces 
the richness and variety of 
Brazilian women's writing to 
English-speaking audiences. It 
also enhances Sadlier's teaching 
objective of the past 15 years: to 
present her students with the best 
and the most provocative 



literatures of Brazil and of Portugal, 
and to challenge them to interpret 
these authors innovati\'ely and in 
depth. One student, a Brazilian, 
took Sadlier's seminar on the 
northeast Brazilian novel last 
spring, expecting not to like it. 
"I liad always hated literature," 
she confessed to Sadlier. Tlie 
power of the novels that Sadlier 
had assigned, however, gave her a 
new appreciation for fiction as well 
as for the issues of class and of 
economics in her own country. 

Sadlier has earned the respect 
of her students in basic language 
classes as well as in graduate 
seminars. David Cruni, an 
anthropology student, met Sadlier 
in 1988. Advised that he would 
have to learn Portuguese in order 
to understand Brazilian Amazon 
culture, Crum enrolled in Sadlier's 
second-year Portuguese class. 
"Language classes can be dull," 
Crum recalls, "but she made 
ours very li\'ely. We acted out 
situations where we had to speak 
Portuguese. The dreary routine of 
memorization never dominated." 



Crum went on to take survey 
couu^es and seminars from Sadlier. 
In Sadlier's seminar on Brazil's 
northeast authors, he recalls feeling 
both humbled and enlightened. 
"I would read the texts," he says, 
"and go to class thinking that I 
knew them. She saw so much 
more in them, so many insights 
and ambiguities and ironies. 
I would leave the classroom 
dazzled." 

Marcia Stephenson, assistant 
professor of Spanish at Purdue 
University, studied with Sadlier 
a^ lU and invited Sadlier to be a 
member of her dissertation 
committee. Because of Sadlier, 
Stephenson featured Brazilian 
writer Clarice Lispector in her 
dissertation. "Darlene went out 
of her way to help me, giving me 
bibliographies, talking to me about 
theory," says Stephenson. "She 
treated me and all of her graduate 
students as colleagues, not as 
rninions. She made us feel that 
our ideas counted." Stephenson 
notes that Sadlier encouraged 
hor to publish while she was in 
graduate school; this kind of 
guidance, she says, helped her 
"move into academe more 
efficiently." 

Currently the coordinator of 
the lU Portuguese program (a 
program that she has directed 
almost unceasingly since 1978), 
Sadlier has made a significant 
effort to reach out to area studies 
programs, including Latin 
American and Caribbean Studies, 
West European Studies, and 
African Studies. She has 
developed a number of 
undergraduate culture courses, 
including one on Mozambique 
and Angola (two former 
Portuguese colonies); and authors 
from Lusophone Africa are part of 
the standard reading for students 
enrolled in the third-year course 
on readings and conversation in 
Portuguese. Sadlier's colleague, 
Heitor Martins, teaches one of the 
c)nly courses on African literature 
in Portuguese in the United States.

Sad licr's current rcstMrch has led 
her to one of the most important 
Portuguese writers, Fernando 
Pessoa. Pessoa's thousands of 
unpublished works, discovered 
after his death in 1935, have 
pro vid ed w ha t Sad 1 i er d escribes 
as "a literal treasure trove" for 
scholars. Throughout his life 
Pessoa wrote under the guise 
of pseudonyms, or, as he called 
them, heteronyms. These alter 
egos — dozens of them — were 
characterized by different names, 
different literary styles, and 
different signatures. Pessoa 
gave the nicist prominent ones 
biographies describing their 
diff*?rent backgrtiunds, professicins, 
and even dates of birth and death. 
Part of Sadlier's project on Pessoa 
explores the genesis of these 
multiple selves in his juvenilia. 
"These artistic forgeries," she says, 
"raise intriguing questions about 
the function of authorship." She 
also is examining Pessoa's 
transformation from a multiplicity 
of selves into a cultural icon c)f 
post-revolutionary Portugal and 
a symbol of national identity. 

The interplay of Brazilian and 
['ortuguese literary worlds 
continues to fascinate Sadlier. 
Minimally affected by each other 
for most of this century, Brazilian 
and Portuguese writers ha\*e 
enjoyed more communication 
since the 1974 revolution — 
especially within the U si five years. 
According to Sadlier, "Portuguese 
and Brazilian writers are focusing 
more on each other's work, each 
other's style, each other's issues. 
The Brazilian tcUniovhi I soap opera! 
has had a major inipact on 
Portuguese cultural life, and 
Portuguese authors are being 
increasingly published in Brazil." 

A tireless correspondent, Sadlier 
maintains the dialogues she has 
established with Portuguese writers 
and with Brazilian academics. 
Since her 1988 tour through Brazil, 
for example, Sadlier has helped 
three Brazilians travel to lU to do 
research with the Women's Studies 
Program. Within her own country 
she communicates regularly with 
Portuguese scholars on both

coasts — and with Brazilian scholars 
in the Midwest. 

Sadlier continues to win 
converts to the literatures that 
she has made her academic focus, 
and she continues to expand her 
own horizons as well. In 1991, an 
academic specialist grant from the 
U.S. Information Agency tciok her 
on another fast-paced tour of four 
universities, this time in Mexico. 
Mer lectures there on feminist 
theory and criticism brought her 
into contact with scholars whose 
work Sadlier describes as "serious 
and intelligent." Sadlier's trip to 
Mexico has presented her with a 



number of important research 
possibilities. 

With deepening Brazilian 
connections leading to furtlier 
scholarly exchanges between 
Brazilian universities and Indiana 
UnivxTsity, steady interest in 
Lusopht)ne Africa, new research 
unfolding on the unpublished work 
of a famous Portuguese author, 
and recent contact with Mexican 
feminist scholars, Sadlier has much 
to sustain her. "These are exciting 
cross-cultural times," she says. 
"I am glad to be a part of them."

— from the sixteenth-century 
manuscript Qvitiirt's Mc.xiaiuos 

"When I first read this kind 
of pi try," savs Gordon 
Broth erst on, professes r of Spanish 
and Portuguese at Indiana 
University, "I remember thinking: 
this is another aesthetic, this is 
another sensibility. There are 
things going on here which I'd like 
to know more about, quite quickly. 
It seemed to me. In those days, to 
mean something utterly different," 



The days BrcUherstt^n refers io 
were the mid l^)60s, when he was 
a recently appointed lecturer at 
the new University c^f Fissex in 
his native Britain. Mis academic 
interest in the literature of Spain 
and Latin America, combined with 
his childhood fascination with 
"Red Indians" and his sympathy 
fc^r them as victims, piqued his 
interest in the earlier culture of 
Mexict^ I le was helped in his 
research by a visiting Fulbrighl 
scholar, the American poet Hdward 
Dorn, who became his friend and 
collabc^rati>r. Such a collaboraticm 
was invaluable, says BrcUherstcMi, 
fi^r at the time there was nc^ 
academic tradition of Native 
American studies in Britain. In fact, 
he says, English-speaking scholars 
in general were very much behind 
in the direct engagement with 
major Native American texts. The 



translatitins that did exist had been 
dt»ne without much regard fi^r the 
literary structures and dimensicms 
of these "fc^reign" texts. 

"I've always been completely 
fascinated by the idea of getting 
in toucii across barriers which 
cUherwise seem to be uncrossable," 
says Brc)therston. "This lliteraturel 
seemed tci offer an insight or 
an entry into this cither, 
different world." 

This different world was, of 
course, all but eliminated by the 
European invasion the western 
hemisphere beginning 500 years 
ago. [n his Rook of tJic Fo}irlh Worhi 
(Cambridge University Press, 1^^J2), 
Brotherston calls the history of the 
Americas during this period "a 
story of depredation for which the 
planet has no parallel. ... In the 
course of just a few centuries its 



11

original inhabitants . . . haw coino 
to be porcoivod as a marginal if 
not entirely disponsabk* tact in 
tho continent's destiny." 

Brolherston agrees that his 
politicc^l concern is not difficult 
to detect. Since both literature 
and politics deal, ultimately, with 
human subjects, ho says the two 
fields have dlways been inseparable 
in his own mind. Partly because 
he is a n a ca d em i c, h e " boca me 
more and more painfully aware of 
how much academic work itself can 
be put to the cause of the dominant 
culture/' even in activities as 
seemingly innocent as mapping, 
place-naming, compiling 
population statistics, and spelling. 
Nevertheless, says Brothers Ion, he 
has always been more a literary 
person than a political activist. As 
he continued to work with Native 
American texts, he "became more 
and more surprised, gratified, if 
you like, by how much could be 
won from this literature for its own 
sake, at the same lime as one could 
be making these other Ipcililical and 
humanitarian 1 points." Perhaps 
his political focus, his political 
strategy, would have been 
different, Brotherslon says, if he 
had not been "electrified" by the 
Aztec poetry he read in !%(->, and 
if he had not thought some of the 
Native American texts among 
the most finely constructed 
and brilliant that he had ever 
encountered. 

lirolherston says in the prologue 
to Fourth World that the optimal 
way to represent Nati\'e Americans 
in all phases of their struggle for 
identity and freedom is through 
their books, "the texts through 
which over time |the| people 
have represented themselves/' 
But many books were destroyed by 
the invading Europeans, and others 
simply have not survived to our 
time. Scholars may work, then, 
only with texts that have been 
published or that are somehow 
available, which means that of the 
hundreds of languages that existed 
in the Americas, only a very few 
can provide material for academic 
study and for political motivation. 



The major languages studied, says 
Brotherston, are Nahua, the Aztec 
language; both the highland and 
lowland languages of the Maya; 
Quechua, the language of the Incas, 
which is still spoken by millions of 
people; and Guarani, spoken by 
peoples in Paraguay and parts 
of Brazil anJ Bolivia. 

The power of NaHve American 
texts to create personal a-''d political 
transformations should not be 
underestimated. Brotherston cites 
the example of Miguel Angel 
Asturias, a Nobel laureate from 
Ciuatemala who, "ignorant of the 
indigencHis culture and literature, 
held and wrote racist opinions 
about what should be done to 
the Indians of his country." 
Then Asturias read the Pofiol vuli, 
the story of creation written down 
in the sixteenth century by the 
Maya Quiche of that of that part 
of Central America. Like Saul on 
the road to Damascus, says 



Brotherston, Asturias underwent 
a complete change. Inspired by 
the Popol vult, wishing tc^ pay 
homage to it, he wrote the novel 
Men (1/ Maize. Aslurias's son took 
as his own the name of the hero of 
that novel, and later joined a Maya 
ndian guerrilla movement and 
became their spokesman. 

The Popol vuh has been called the 
Bible of the Americas; it describes 
a series of creations, culminating in 
the creation, from maize, of human 
beings. Like manv Mesoamerican 
texts produced after the arrival of 
the Spanish, it is written in the 
Roman alphabet. As an expression 
of the culture of the Maya Quiche, 
says Brotherston, "it does for 
them what certain books of the 
Old Testament do for the idea of 
a state of Israel. There is a direct 
connection between this book and 
a political reality." Similar opin- 
ions are held by the recent Nobel 
Peace Prize winner Rigoberta 
Menchu, herself a Maya Quiche.

waters below. 



There is also a connection 
between the Popol vuh and what 
Brotherston calls in Fourth World 
the communally held faith among 
Native Americans in the earth as 
matrix, or source, and in the life 
and philosophy that explicitly 
conserve nature's resources. 
Adam appears in the first chapter 
of Genesis and is given dominion 
over the earth and its creatures. 
By comparison, the Popol vuh 
describes a cosmogony in which 
human beings are late arrivals 
in the scheme of the creations; 
everything else and everyone 
else has been around much longer. 
"That, psychologically, is very 
important," says Brotherston. 
"One of the things you can never 
forget while reading the Popol vuh 
is that we are like late guests at a 
party and should not behave as if 
the party were held only in our 
honor." This belief that all creation 
is important, he says, that nature 
is not a fair target for human 
exploitation, is a very profound 
and consistent motif in Native 
American mythology. 

In fact, says Brotherston, the 
consistency of Native American 
creation myths is remarkable. 
"One of the constants is in the 
diversity of creation/' he says, 
which is in marked contrast to the 
straightforward creation found in 
the biblical Genesis. "The normal 
mode [in these works 1 is for there 
tc) be quite a long process before 
the world as we know it finally 
emerges. A cosmogony that 
involves multiple creations is 
another of the characteristics. 
Those creations, known from Chile 
to the United States, reproduce, in 
some cases blow for blow, the same 
phenomena, the same catastrophes, 
including the flood, a prolonged 
eclipse, volcanic eruptions and 
a rain of fire and ash, and a 
hurricane." 

The literature through which 
the indigenous people of America 
represent themselves is not all from 
the distant past, however. Native 
languages continue to be spoken, 
says Brotherston, and literature of 
all kinds continues to be composed 



in them. Through his travels in 
Latin America and his contacts 
with Native Americans, 
Brotherston has compiled a 
bilingual anthology of recent 
verse in five native languages. 
He has titled the book An Kalu 
(in press), "which in the Cuna 
language of Panama means 'our 
stronghold' and serves here to 
denote all that is held on to, in 
speech and literature, by . . . 
Native Americans generally." 

By publishing poetry in 
their native languages, says 
Brotherston, the authors have 
made an important literary choice. 
"In each case they gained a range 
of expression not necessarily 
available in an imported language 
like Spanish." Native American 
languages, for example, express 
gender and person differently, 
which can critically affect a 
poem's interpretation. 



There are also philosophical 
concepts that are unique to 
the Anu^ricas, including the 
importance of agriculture and the 
interconnection of time and space. 
With very few exceptions, says 
Brotherston, the agricultural ethic 
has always been quite intricately 
bound up with the lives and 
religions and myths of Native 
Americans. Thus "there is a 
reverence for plants which is for 
us very difficult to understand at 
first." As to time and space, the 
Native American tradition never 
fully divorces the two, says 
Brotherston. For this reason, 
it never produced systematic 
charts or maps like those of the 
Europeans, with their grid systems 
and their representations of the 
earth's surface independent of 
time. "Nowhere in American 
cosmogonies do we find the world 
considered independently of time," 



13 



Maize plant iiicufificci /^s human 
hcin^, turoriii}!;^ to tlic crcnfion 
s/on/ told in the Popol vuh 



says Brc>therston. Native texts 
often included symbolic maps, 
such as the Mendciza codex, which 
depicts place names and spatial 
directions, as well as the dates a 
ruler held pcnver, and the inflow 
of commodity tribute from the 
provinces to the A/,tec capital, 
it represents, therefore, a dynamic 
and complicated conception of 
the world, unlike the static picture 
shown in European maps. 

The choice of the A/f Kniu 
authors to use their native 
language also has political 
significance, according to 
Brotherston, It "allows each poet 
an attitude towards the official 
Spanish of his country, either by 
exulting in autonomy and refusing 
to admit even a word of it, or by 
incorporating it judiciously." 
Thus the poems "make their own 
act of resistance." 

Brotherston calls the anthology 
a mere indication of the powerful 
native verse that has appeared over 
the last several decades. That the 
poems exist at all is proof, he says, 
of the determination, enduring and 
resurgent, of native peoples. Those 
peoples and their literatures have 
existed ctintinually, of course, but 
have rarely been acknowledged, 
hi addition, says Brotherston, for 
a long time many of the native 



societies chose not to communicate 
their literature to the invaders of 
their lands. Th.ey guarded their 
accounts of creation, for example, 
out of the belief that revealing 
them could damage or even destroy 
their cultures. 

The main focus of Brothcrston's 
scholarly attention is on Mexico, 
and particularly on the Nahua- 
speaking cultures. Yet he does 
not want to be considered only 
a Mesoamerican scholar. He 
continues to travel in South 
America, making and maintaining 
contacts with writers and teachers 
there. "I think, indeed, one can 
understand Mexico better if one 
is looking at it from Peru or 
Argentina or Chile," he says. 

Brotherston first traveled 
to Latin America in 1966, 
primarily as a representative of 
the University of Essex. He was 
establishing academic connections 
and buying bt^oks for the 
university library. He was also 
doing his own research and 
serving as the editor of a Latin 
American series for the Pergamon 
IVess. The trip was a very 
important experience for him, 
says Brotherston, and, in terms of 
language, he felt suddenly freed 
of restraints. "There's a whole 
universe," he thought at the time. 
"It's Spanish-speaking, it's 
Portuguese-speaking, it's some- 
other-thing-speaking. They 



[languages! ft'cl quite different 
now because ihey are part of a 
much broader reality," 

In 1^)68, Brotherston spent a 
year as a visiting professor at the 
University of Iowa — a year that 
was highly rewarding, he says. 
He met a great many people who 
were also interested in Native 
American studies. He started 
doing small translations of nati\'e 
texts, working with other scholars, 
at a time when such work was sud- 
denly very much in the air. Then, 
in 1970, Brotherston was appointed 
as a fellow at the Alexander von 
Humboldt Institute in Berlin and 
Hamburg, The Germans have a 
long tradition of working with 
Native American materials, says 
Brtitherston, and were the first to 
decipher Maya hieroglyphs. The 
fellowship year was a turning point 
in his career and absolutely vital to 
his development as a scholar of 
Native American literature. Now, 
for the academic year 1993-94, he 
has received a Guggenheim Award, 
which will take h*m to Mexico. He 
plans to explore the significance of 
place signs in native texts, like 
the Mendoza Codex, 



Brotherston came to Indiniiti 
University, in 19^0, because he 
had always heard the uni\'ersity 
spoken of favorably. The Latin 
American collection at the lU 
Libraries impressed him, as did the 
fact that the lU Press had produced 
some very important volumes in 
his field. The university has gcxid 
scholars r.ot only in Latin American 
studies, siys Brotherston, but in 
related fieid'i, such as comparative 
literature, folklore, and history. 
The American Indian Studies 
Research Institute has also been 
useful to his research, lie says, 
and its director, Raymond 
DeMallie, helped considerably 
on Book of the Fourth Worhi. 

Brotherston introduces both 
graduate and undergraduate 
students to Native American 
1 i te ra t ii re . U n d e rgra d ii a tes are 
interested in the subject, he says, 
especially in the possibility of 
comparing the experience of native 
peoples in the United States with 
those of peoples in other countries 
in both North and South America. 
Brotherston offers an 
undergraduate course each 
semester on the culture and 
civilization of Latin America. 
Concentrating on anthology 
stories, he works into the 
discussion his knowledge of the 
native cultures from which the 
stories emerge. This methodology 
works fairly well, he says. "You 
can go quite a long way back in 
this fashion and often enough 
there are very gratifyingly direct 
refercMices in the stories to the 
Indians or to a particular word 
that has come from the Indian 
culture." 



''One of the things you 
can never forget while 
reading the Popol vuh 
is that we are like late 
guests at a party and 
should not behave as if 
the party were held only 
in our honor." 



In the fall of W2, Brotherston 
taught a graduate course, "The 
Vision of America as a Version of 
Genesis," which was based in part 
on the assertion that the Americas 
have had their own genesis and 
that it is up to us, as scholars, to 
discover it. The class sought to 
define the "vision" of America and 
investigated what literary critics 
and others have said about that 
vision. Close readings of the Popol 
vuh and other indigenous 
cosmogonies followed. Finally, the 
class brought all of this material 
together and examined its influence 
on the works of major Latin 
American novelists. 

Brotherston has also taught a 
graduate course in Latin American 
poetry, the objective of which was 
to demonstrate that Latin American 
literature has its antecedents not 
only in Spain and Europe, but also 
in the native literary traditions 
proper to the Americas. The course 
focused particularly on a book of 
poems, tioma^c to the Aiiicriavi 
luiii(Vi<, by the Nicaraguan writer 
Ernesto Cardenal. It was designed 
to situate the poems in terms of the 
cultures to which they refer, and in 
relationship to the texts that have 
come (Hit of those cultures. 



The impact those texts can have 
is clear. Asturias lived in a country 
full of Mayas but never noticed 
them, never recognized their 
humanity, until he read the text of 
the I^opol vuh. Cardenal, too, has 
written about ancient Mexico, and 
the Maya, and the rain forests. "In 
every case, in this homage," says 
Brotherston, "he invokes, quotes, 
rephrases, and integrates native 
texts produced by those cultures." 
It is a literary exercise, adds 
Brotherston, and also important in 
its political implications. Instead of 
merely exclaiming "Oh, the poor 
Indians," Cardenal asks his readers 
to listen to what those Indians have 
to say. 

In his books and in his teaching, 
Brotherston makes it possible for 
us to listen to Native Americans, 
to listen to their literature, their 
classics, their own culture.

Encounter of Two Worlds 




Normatt Bradley, Professor of Fine Arts, Indiana University-Purdue University 
Fort Wayne 



When he first went to Mexico 
thirty-odd years ago, 
painter Norman Bradley began 
two simultaneous journeys. His 
life and art have had to do, both 
literally and symbolically, with 
travel, with exploration, with 
encounters. Over the years he 
has wandered through most parts 
of Latin America. And he has 
painted, taking a "journey through 
my own inner world by way of 
art — shape, color, paint." Intuition, 
says Bradley, has always been 
his guide. 

Most of Bradley's work is 
nonrepresentational, though he 
doesn't call it abstract, asserting 
that "all visual art is abstract." His 
media — oil and, to a lesser extent, 
w^atercolor and acr)'lic — and the 
aesthetic principles that frame 
his work reflect the heritage of 
European painting. But he says 
"the signs, symbols, imagery, and 
surface are more a direct reflection 
of my involvement over four 
decades with the art of ancient 
Mesoamerica, such as that of the 
Maya, Zapotecs, and Tarascans, 
and the Nahua-speaking people 
of central Mexico. Both sources 
are an integral part of my work as 
a modem artist." 

Bradley, associate professor of 
fine arts at Indiana University- 
Purdue University Fort Wayne, 
sees his paintings as one result 
of the 500-year-long encounter 
between two worlds. But he notes 
an ironic reversal of "new" and 
"old" in the intertwining strands of 
his work, "The European aspect of 
the 'Old World' is really the 'nev/ 
of my work — that is, modern 
abstract art as it has evolved in 
the twentieth century and as it has 
influenced me. The 'New World' 
represents the 'old' of my work — 
that is, the influence of ancient 
American art. These artistic tradi- 
tions represent the dual sources of 
my painting and the reason my 
life's work embodies this encounter 
of two worlds." 



Although his interest in Mexico 
and native Mexican art bore fruit 
in the pre-Columbian art history 
classes that he has taught, that 
interest did not manifest itself 
overtly in Bradley's own painting 
for some years. Nevertheless, the 
artist's work has been shaped 
in part by his research on 
pre-Columbian art history and 
the landscape and history of 
l^tin America. 

Stela B, rendered in oil on 
canvas, exemplifies in both form 
and name the union of disparate 
influences in Bradley's work. The 
painting is reminiscent of Mayan 
stelae, upright stone slabs carved 
with intricate, stylized figures and 
hieroglyphs. Exuberant plumes 
of yellow and red paint suggest 



the feathers commonly found in 
traditional Mayan art. The B, he 
says, is for "Bradley, the roots of 
which, for me, lie in eighteenth- 
century East Yorkshire, England." 

Mexico and Latin America held 
no special fascination for Bradley as 
a high school student, and he never 
expected that his first youthful 
encounter with Latin America, 
specifically Mexico, would turn 
out to have a lifelong influence 
on his art and his teaching interests. 
But he did want a break from his 
hometown environs m the guise 
of a foreign adventure. So in 1955, 
after a year of study at the Fort 
Wayne Art School, Bradley and 
two friends decided to travel south 
of the border to "haul up stakes 
and get out of Fort Wayne" and to 
continue their studies.

stela 6, 1989 



At the end of the vSummer, the 
season's wages in hand, they 
headed south in a 1940 Plymouth 
to begin studying Spanish and art 
at Mexico City College. "It was all 
so new to me, and so very, very 
different, and 1 fell in love with 
Mexico very quickly, it was almost 
as if I had some connection with it," 
Bradley recalls. He completed his 
B.F.A. at Mexico City College in 
1959, spent three years in the 
service, and returned to Mexico 
to earn his M.F.A. at * University 
of the Americas in 1964. "By the 
lime I completed my master's 
degree I was absolutely dedicate<^ 
to the study of pre-Columbian art 
history," he says. 

Although Bradley finds Mayan 
painting, sculpture, and other art 
forms interesting, his attention has 
been focused mainly on Mayan 
architecture. The ancient Maya 
lived in an area that included 
modern-day Belize and Guatemala 
and portions of Mexico, Honduras, 
and El Salvador. They left 
thousands of ruins scattered 
throughout Mexico and Central 
America, providing ample 
material for decades of study and 
inspiration and a broad geographic 
base in which to work. Bradley's 
locus of interest has gradually 
shifted from the Maya of central 
Mexico, where he first encountered 
their rich legacy, to those of the 
Yucatan and Guatemala. 

Starting in 1978, Bradley 
completed over a period of about 
eight years a series of 30 paintings 
of Mayan ruins. He recalls, "It was 
a sort of sideline with me because 
my usual work is nonrepresenta- 
tional. But 1 was doing both types 
of painting at the same time. I did 
the paintings of the ruins partly as 
illustrations. 1 was hoping to get 
them published, but never found 
the right vehicle for them." The 
paintings are in the spirit of the 
drawings of English architect 
and artist Frederick Catherwcx^d, 
whose illustrated travelogues 
about Central America, the Middle 
East, Asia Minor, and Europe 
were popular during the 
nineteenth century. 



Bradley's painting of Structure 
K"5 at Piedras Negras, Guatemala, 
is the only image in color of that 
pyramid that Bradley knows of 
anywhere in the world. The 
painting was inspired by the work 
of Mayanist/archaeologist Tatiana 



Proskouriakoff, who published her

from the Albwu, on various

archaeological sources, and on 
photographs of other pyramids 
taken by his wife, professional 
photographer Dixie Bradley. 
He added color to K-5 "somewhat 
arbitrarily" because the pyramid 
no longer exists. The result, says 
Bradley, is "conjecture in an 
archaeological sense. The color is 
almost romantic color, the color of 
the atmosphere of the tropical rain 
forest more than a specifically 
literal archaeological rendering." 

Bradley's paintings portray 
different types of Mayan 
ceremonial structures from the 
different regions of Central 
America. For the most part, 
explains Bradley, the pyramid 
portion of a structure served as 
a platform for a temple, often of 
modest size, set on top. A few 
pyramids contain tombs; others 
are solid. Although the 30 
paintings have not been published, 
a number of them were exhibited 
in Indianapolis during the 
Pan-American Games Festival 
of the Arts in August 1987, and 
elsewhere. 

Bradley perceives an 
intuitive connection between his 
archaeological paintings and his 
nonrepresentational oils. He says 
the connection is based on his 
experiences in various parts of 
Latin America and "here, on this 
side of the Atlantic, in the 
Americas, as opposed to living 
in Europe with all that ciltural 
baggage." Although he 
acknowledges the influen<.e of 
pre-Columbian art on his c wn 
paintings, he "very siwH\Jusly" 
tries not to imitate the outward 
appearance of that art. Still, 
Bradley incorporates into his work 
such elements as the X, the Mayan 
symbol for the day or the sun, and 
rounded shapes similar to Mayan 
hieroglyphs, which are oblong 
cartouches v/ilh rounded corners. 

The creative and interpretive 
processes in art interest Bradley 
as much as the content of a 
painting. "A lot of people see 
nonrepresentational painting and 
think, 'well, the artist just slapped 
a bunch of paint on the canvas.' 
Nothing can be further from the 
truth. ' struggle with these things. 



''The color is almost 
romantic color, the color 
of the atmosphere of the 
tropical rain forest more 
than a specifically literal 
archaeological 
rendering/' 



I've got about thirty of them going 
right now. I work them and I go 
back and I change them. 
Sometimes I even have a show, 
and then go back and change 
them. I finish only about six 
or seven paintings a year." 

Bradley's paintings are 
"painterly," he sa^s. "Values 
of color are more important than 
delineation; mood is more 
important than some kind of 
idealization." He seeks inspiration 
not only in his travels to Latin 
America, but also in his own 
backyard. "I love all the 
irregularities in nature. I go out 
and see all the beautiful trees and 
all the sticks down on the ground, 
all the 'litter of nature,' and I really 
enjoy all that. I guess some of that 
gets into my painting." 

While his experience in Mexico 
influenced his painting in subtle 
ways early on, Bradley notes that 
his forutative years as a painter 
occurred during the abstract 
expressionist period and that his 
work followed that direction for 
many years. In particular he 
mentions his affinity for the 
COBRA (Copenhagen, Brussels, 
and Amsterdam) group active in 
the late 1940s and early 1950s. 
"There's a primitive directness in 
those works that has, strangely, a 
kind of beauty about it," he says. 
"Paintings that are really slick and 
precise and so forth kind of irritate 
me. I don't want the artist to do all 
the work. I want to be able to fill in 
with my imagination and complete 
the thing in my own being. ' 

Bradley's nonrepresentational 
paintings are worked on two- 
dimensional canvases, yet he 



introduces a third dimension 
with texture. He says, "1 have a 
tendency to get involved with paint 
and surface. It's not an intentional 
use of some sort of texturizing 
medium; it's just paint, it's just 
because I really work on the 
paintings." The result is a final 
work composed of many layers. 
"I'm not interested in my paintings 
being pretty," Bradley says. "I 
think beauty comes out in other 
ways. To me texture and paint are 
beautiful. When you try to create 
an aesthetic, it's a much different 
story than just creating paintings. 
You're trying to create something 
that's not just new — it's not just 
novelty for the sake of novelty. 
Actually, there's very little that's 
new in here. My painting is 
borrowed from all kinds of other 
artists." 

Yet the meanings of Bradley's 
paintings are all his own. A work 
of art, he says, can have multiple 
meanings, as does his painting 
Can he, or "Caribbean" in Spanish. 
"The Yucatan is the western edge 
of the Caribbean," he says. 
"When we're there, which we are 
frequently, we stay in the Caribe 
Hotel, kind of our home away 
from home. Of course, you'd 
have to know these things exist to 
understand the layers of meaning 
in the title." Although Cnribc does 
not deliberately depict anything 
Caribbean, the loose, circular 
strokes of blues, greens, near- 
whites, and contrasting darks of 
this four-foot-square painting 
suggest the setting that inspired it. 

Bradley is deeply concerned 
with composition in his own work 
and in that of his students. "I'm 
almost a classicist," he says. "What 
I'm really laboring on is the sense 
that a work is well composed — the 
way the eye moves around, the 
way it balances." Bradley describes 
his working style as close to that of 
an "action painter." When he 
works on a painting, he does so 
intensely and quickly, sacrificing 
some element of control to the 
creative passion. He points to his 
finished painting Red and explains, 
"I may have eight or ten paintings 
under here that I didn't think made 
it. Then 1 got to this stage and said. 



19 




structure K-5 at Picdras Ncgros, 1979 

OK, it holds together, this is a 
gestalt, a unity of expression that 
says right now what i think this 
painting can say." 

Reaching that stage of 
completion can take a long time, 
Bradley notes. "I have another 
painting here that 1 had worked on 
for three years and just couldn't get 
right. You can develop a mental 
block, which is why travel is very 
good for me. We went to Europe, 
and some things happened that 
triggered something in me. I came 
back and worked on the painting 
for maybe two hours, and it was 
done! It was almost like a bolt 
of lightning. 

"My painting is like travel, 
a voyage into the edges of the 
unknown. That's what's exciting 
about it — you never know quite 
what's going to happen. Then 
it all gets changed, and 1 get 
exasperated, to the point where 
I think well, this is utter rot, it's 
worthless to go on. And the next 
minute it pulls together, and for 
days I'm walking on clouds." 



Freedom to paint what and as 
he wants is important to Bradley, 
and he recognizes that not all artists 
have that luxury. "It's nice that 1 
have a teaching job that makes a 
living for me," he says. "I don't 
have to sell paintings. I've sold a 
good number in recent years, but 
I don't have to, so I can follow my 
own intiiition and I don't have to 
please anyone." Teaching gives 
him the opportunity to pass on 
some of his knowledge of and 
love for Latin American culture and 
pre-Columbian art to his students. 

Bradley teaches 400-level courses 
in art history, including Western 
art of the nineteenth and twentieth 
centuries. His favorite, though, 
is the pre-Columbian art history 
course, which surveys all of the 
time periods and styles of ancient 
American art, including those of 
the Maya. Although the majority 
of his students are fine arts or art 
history majors, faculty members 
in other departments often refer 
students to the pre-Columbian 
art course. "Some people take the 
course because they're just curious, 
or are planning a trip to Latin 
America," Bradley says. 



Whatever their reasons for 
enrolling, students are exposed 
throuj^h the course to a part of the 
wc.l^ dbout which most know 
very little. "So many people are so 
culture bound, they know nothing 
about Latin America. Some 
students have even retaken the 
course out of interest; one student 
took it three times — an A student; 
he didn't have to take it. I asked 
why, and he said 'I just like it.' 
I think it opens windows to 
something new." 

This summer Bradley's jour., y 
will come nearly full circle. He 
plans to explore once again the area 
west of Mexico City, near Morelia 
in the state of Michoacan. "It's an 
area I haven't been to for a while." 
he says. "I need to renew my 
contact with the place. There are 
some ruins there I've never been 
to and want to see." 

Bradley notes that many people 
think the Maya no longer exist. 
Yet, he points out, they are the 
largest Indian group north of Peru. 
"You can go to Guatemala and in 
one little area you see the Quiche 
Maya, go down the road and there 
are the Cakchiquel Maya, go to 
a different place and find the 
Tzutuhil. Twenty-three languages 
are spoken. These people are ail 
Maya, but each subgroup has its 
own version of history, its own 
costumes, its own culture." Parts of 
southern Mexico are similarly rich 
in cultural diversity. Furthermore, 
Mexico has some 10,000 
archeological sites, and there 
are thousands more in Central 
America. He says, "I hope we'll 
rediscover the Americas. 
Americans have such strong 
bonds with Europe — I think what 
language connects even oceans 
can't separate. But Latin America is 
an enormously rich are culturally, 
so interesting, and so much to see. 
Where else can you find an ethnic 
culture like the Maya?"

Here Conrad is shotvn at San Antonio, Peru, recording obsenmtions on one of 
the structures. 




or only a moment it seemed 
like a good idea — to put the 



white powder in a plastic bag and 
bring it back to Bloomington for 
analysis. It had been found under a 
layer of dirt inside a box excavated 
in the prehistoric village of San 
Antonio, Peru. But then Geoffrey 
Conrad's inner voice said, "Now, 
wait a minute, Geoff. Before we go 
walking through Miami airport 
customs with some white powder 
from Peru, even prehistoric white 
powder from Peru — you'd better 



get an advance permit from every 
agency of the U.S. government you 
can think of. 

"It's not the kind of thing I 
want to be sitting in the airport 
at three in the morning trying to 
<^xplain," says Conrad, professor 
of anthropology, chairperson of 
the anthropology department, and 
director of the William Hammond 
Mathers Museum. 

The white powder is still in 
Peru. Conrad will wonder about it 
until he can legally bring it back to 
the Bloomington campus for 
analysis, though he speculates that 



it is probably hallucinogenic and 
was used for ceremonial purposes. 
It is also only a tiny piece of the 
jigsaw puzzle that constitutes his 
work in San Antonio. There, 
among the pottery shards and 
fallen fieldstone walls of houses, 
for seven years Conrad and his 
graduate archaeology students 
have been painstakingly piecing 
together the tangible elements of 
the lives of people who left no 
written language to speak for them. 

While Conrad admires and 
sometimes envies historians who 
have the advantage of chronicles 
and records and even stone tablets, 
he is challenged by the piecemeal 
nature of his work. And there is 
another facet of archaeology that 
draws him to the discipline. "For 
me and for most archaeologists, 
the link to the past is so much more 
immediate when you're holding 
in your hand something that's 
connected to people. You can't 
put individual names to those 
people the way historians can, but 
the sense for me is stronger with 
the object that was made and used 
and discarded in the past than it is 
with what's written down and 
transmitted," he explains. 

Conrad first enjoyed this 
sense of immediacy at an early 
age. "When I was about seven 
and a half, we moved into an old 
farmhouse built around 1775, and 
we had a garden in the back," he 
says. "I would find things like old 
cut nails and pottery. I just thought 
it was fascinating that there was in 
the ground some tangible link to 
the past." Conrad's interest might 
have remained one of many, except 
for an imaginative sixth-grade 
teacher who took an interest in him. 
Among the books she suggested he 
read were Prescctt's Conquest of 
Mexico and Conquest of Pern.

Antonio. 



"So I was going to be an 
archaeologist, and I was going 
to work in Latin America on the 
Aztecs and the Incas/' Conrad 
recalls. He says the interest went 
dormant until he was in high 
school and beginning plans for a 
major in college. Again, it was a 
teacher (of history) who restarted 
his thinking about archaeology 
and pointed him in that direction. 

Today, looking out at a sea of 
student faces in the classroom, 
Conrad realizes that a profession 
in archaeology is not for everyone. 
In his sophomore ancient 
civilizations course, he tells 
the students that few if any of 
them will become professional 
archaeologists. He is more 
concerned with developing 
their interest in archaeology and 
showing them how to maintain it 
for the rest of their lives, no matter 
what they go on to do. 

He says to the undergraduates, 
"The big questions that interest 
me aren't going to get answered 
in my lifetime. There are no final 
answers. There's no punch line to 
this joke at the end of this semester. 
I'm going to tell you what we know 
now, and I'm going to try to get 
you to think about it logically, 
coherently, so that you can put 
together an interpretation and 
back it up." 

Conrad's graduate students 
already know that, of course. 
They have followed him to Peru, 
risking harassment by guerrillas 
as they conduct research at the San 
Antonio excavation. While still 
apprentices, Conrad's graduate 
students get practical on-site 
experience, the reality of what they 
have read in their textbooks and 
heard in classrooms. The students 
learn vital basics that seasoned 
archaeologists already know — how 
to plan for the orderly excavation of 
a site, including creating grids of 
the site if necessary or appropriate, 
dividing the labor, carefully 
tagging artifacts, and other tasks. 

At San Antonio the graduate 
students oversee squads of three 
or four laborers. Research is an 
on-the-spot, ongoing affair, 
sometimes sending Conrad back 
to the United States to consult 



resources that may shed some 
light or provide some clues about 
a discovery. "That process goes 
on all the time. You're constantly- 
analyzing and reanalyzing. You 
come back home and think about 
the things that you found. You 
invariably think of things you wish 
you'd asked while you were down 
there," Conrad says. 

Because most countries today 
have laws that forbid the removal 
of archaeological artifacts, the 
research process Conrad and his 
graduate student assistants are 
involved in has to include 
anticipation of what various objects 
mean in relation to the total mosaic 
of culture. "For me, since I can't 
bring most of the things I find back, 
even temporarily, I have to do the 
analyzing down there," he says. 

Some of the tools Conrad uses in 
analyzing what he and his students 
find are written materials. Though 
the people of San Antonio did not 
have a written language, the 
Spanish introduced theirs to Peru 
in the 1530s. "There are major 
Spanish chronicles, early accounts 
of Peru by Spanish missionaries 
and governmental authorities," 
Conrad says. "These are the people 
who at least encountered the Inca 
Empire and its provinces directly 
and wrote down their observations, 
sometimes misunderstanding what 



they saw or recasting it in 
European terms. Nevertheless, 
they were there, and I wasn't. So 
what they had to say is something 
I can work with." 

Together, the written chronicles 
of the missionaries and others and 
the archaeological data found by 
Conrad allow him to develop a 
clearer understanding of the 
civilization. By combining 
archaeology and ethnohistory in 
the study of later prehistory, he 
hopes to generate hypotheses about 
the early development of Peruvian 
civilization that can be tested 
against the purely archaeological 
remains of the more remote past. 
"In essence, I am trying to establish 
an archaeological baseline — an 
understanding of how late 
prehistoric practices and 
institutions are reflected in 
the ground — that can be carried 
further into the past," Conrad says. 

The main focus of Conrad's 
research is the relationship between 
people of the Lake Titicaca Basin 
and those of the eastern and 
western slopes of the Andes in 
the time between 1000 A.D. and the 
Spanish conquest. Conrad says, 
"My recent work has had three 
interrelated thematic emphases: 
the role of religious beliefs in 
cultural development; the recovery 
of cultural 'intangibles' — social. 



22 




Archncohgicnl sites of Peru 

political, and religious ideas and 
institutions — that are not directly 
preserved in the archaeological 
record; and the interaction of those 
'intangibles' with more matcrinl 
phenomena such as technology 
and subsistence economy in 
Central Andean prehistory." 

At the same time, he is very 
much aware that his approach 
is contrary to what many other 
archaeologists believe. He 
explains that archaeologists usually 
look for the causes of prehistoric 
cultural development in material 
phenomena: environment, 
technology, demography, and 
subsistence economy. That 
approach treats religion 
as secondary. 

"The theoretical position can be 
very comforting to archaeologists," 
Conrad says. "In archaeology, it is 
much easier to obtain and interpret 
data on material phenomena than 
on nonmaterial ones, and the 
temptation to see causality in that 
which is most readily retrievable 
is understandable. Through my 
Peruvian research I have come 



to believe that it is more useful 
to view material and nonmalerial 
phenomena as influencing 
each other." 

Apprentices who work on 
archaeological sites may be less 
interested in theories than in 
finding something exotic. Conrad's 
graduate students already know 
that spectacular finds at an 
excavation site are few and far 
between. "Most of them have had 
some field experience before," he 
explains. "It's typical of the way 
I was trained, the way most 
archaeologists in this country are 
trained. You start out as a digger. 
In Peru my students are busy with 
taking notes and collecting the 
material, while I go around, 
circulating among the four or 
five excavation units." 

The graduate students Conrad 
has taken to San Antonio have 
come from the Universities of 
Chicago and Michigan, as well 
as Indiana University. There have 
also been a number of Peruvian 
graduate students. Part of the 
learning process for these students 



is the realization that at a site like 
the one at San Antonio, it is 
impossible to excavate all of it. 
"You can't excavate five acres. 
There's not enough time or money 
to do that. So what I have to do is 
to determine what we're actually 
going to excavate if we're going 
to get some representative samples 
out of the site/' Conrad says. 

Conrad's own path from 
anthropology major to professional 
archaeologist led him from the 
foothills of Wyoming, where he 
worked two summers at a 
paleo-Indian site dating back to 
10,000-8,000 B.C., to Labrador, 
where he and colleagues found 
an eighteenth -century Eskimo 
winter house, the highlight of 
their archaeological efforts. 

Convinced that he was going 
to be an Arctic specialist, Conrad 
wrote his senior thesis on findings 
in Labrador. But in the summer of 
1970 he had the opportunity to 
fill an empty staff position at an 
archaeological project in Chan 
Chan, Peru. Conrad did not 
anticipate rekindling an enduring 
interest in the area, however. 

"I thought it would be one 
summer's exotic experience, and 
then 1 would be back to the Arctic 
region again. And so I went down 
speaking no Spanish and arrived 
at Chan Chan two or three weeks 
after a major earthquake," says 
Conrad. Though he had previously 
seen aerial photos of the site, noth- 
ing could have prepared him for 
what he saw when he got there. 

"Literally the biggest site I had 
ever \vorked on would have fit 
comfortably on the front lawn of 
the Mathers Museum along Eighth 
Street. Chan Chan was the capital 
of a late prehistoric empire, and its 
ruins cover ten square miles. There 
is a well inside one of the ten royal 
palace compounds that is about the 
size of a football field," he says. 

Even the necessity of walking 
around with a Spanish dictionary in 
his hand and having to write down 
what he wanted to tell the laborers 
did not dampen his enthusiasm for 
the work. Digging in the Arctic 
had yielded its odd bones and tools 
found at temporary campsites, but 
Chan Chan was vastly different.

"As [ wolketl around that first 
day, I saw a piece of cloth sticking 
out of the ground. I knew it was 
prehistoric cloth. I Icrc was this 
six-hundred -year-old piece of cloth 
sticking out of the ground, and you 
could have put il into the washing 
machine and it would have been 
as good as new. i had ne\'er seen 
lhat kind of preservation before/' 
he says. 

Conrad was hooked. By ]^^S4 
he and colleagues from the Field 
Museum of Chicago, Southern 
Illinois University, and .ne 
Universities of Florida, Chicag^^, 
and California, Santa Barbara had 
formed a cooperative effort to 
explore the prehistorical cultures 
of the southernmost part of Peru. 
Their work was underwritten by 
grants from the National Science 
Foundation, the Natitmal 
CJeographic Society, and the 
National Hndowment for 
the Humanities. 

Conrad explains that studying 
prehistoric Peruvian civilizations 
is important because these 
civilizations formed independently 
from outside influences. In 
archaeoli^gical terminology, 
they are considered "primary" 
Of 'pristine" and in that sense 
are comparable to the ancient 
civilizations of Mesopotamia, 
Egypt, the Indus Valley, and China. 

Important as delving into the 
past of the Central Andes may be 
to Conrad and his colleagues, 
political events in Peru have had a 
chilling effect upon the few North 
American archaeologists who have 
specialized in that area of the 
world. The guerrillas of the 
Sciuicro iMuiino^ih also known as 
the Shining l\ith, have attempted 
to paralyze the country with 
terrorist activities that disrupt 
archaeological pursuits, which are 
unrelated to contemporary politics. 
For a variety of reasons, Conrad 
has not taken a team of students to 
Peru since 1990. For the past three 
years he has spent his research time 
sifting thrtKigh a backlog of data 
and mentally organizing the 
material into cultural categories. 




Aerial I'/Wt' of one of the royal palnee conipoimd^i at Chan Chan 



Conrad recalls the experience 
of a fellow archaeologist who was 
given 24 hours to pack up and get 
out after Shining Path guerrillas 
shot and killed his laborers. "I, 
individually, am a small target, but 
1 will not expose my family to such 
dangers as exist in Peru today," 
Conrad comments. It is unclear 
what effect the arrest in September 
1992 of the guerrillas' leader, 
one-time philosophy professor 
Abimael Guzman, will have on 
archaeological activity. 

Unless there are changes that 
involve increased danger, Conrad 
plans to return to Peru next 
summer to do at least two things. 
The actual excavating at San 
Antonio is finished for the moment, 
but Conrad intends to reevaluate 
his earlier finds in order to answer 
some intriguing questions, and 
he will study possible new sites in 
Chile or Bolivia, where it is safer. 
Abandoning the San Antonio site 
will not be easy for Conrad, but he 
is quick to explain that there are 
strong cultural relationships 



between the people around San 
Antonio and the groups in Chile 
and Bolivia. 

Wherever he continues his 
comparison of ancient ci\'ilizations 
of the Andes with those of the Lake 
Titicaca Basin, Conrad will take 
along his somewhat controversial 
hypothesis that the material and 
nonmaterial aspects of prehistoric 
Peruvian culture influenced each 
other. Thus he will continue to 
challenge the traditional view that 
religion was secondary and played 
a role in maintaining the status quo. 

"My interpretation of my 
research is that a series of religious 
reforms plaved vital roles in both 
the rise and fall of the Inca Empire 
between 1440 and 1532 A.D./' 
Conrad says. "Through 
reworkings of the basic Andean 
religious tradition of cults of the 
dead and ancestor worship, the 
Incas de\'eIoped a central state 
cult in which the mummies of 
dead rulers were the crucial, 
tangible links between the Inca 
people and their pantheon."

K(^Vcil mummies in their 
paliiccs — such as the ones in Chnn 
Chan — were treated as if they 
were still alive, retained (Hvnership 
of their lands, and continued to 
receive income from taxes they had 
levied for Iheir own benefit, Conrad 
explains. The emperor Huascar 
(1?25-1532) tried to disenfranchise 
the royal mummies and set off a 
civil war, which tore apart the 
Inca Hmpire before the arrival 
of the Spanish. 

Conrad does not oversimplify 
this point of view to the extent of 
claiming that religion was the only 
cause of the inca Umpire's rise 
and fall, however. His 1984 book 

ami Empire (coauthored 
with Arthur Demarest and 
published by Cambridge 
University Press) argues for 
a multicausal interpretation, 
emphasizing the interaction of 
religious, economic, social, and 
political forces at work in 
Inca history.

Archaeology in the Public Interest

In 1975 K. Anne Pyburn was nn 
u nd e rg r ad u n t e a n th ro po 1 ogy 
student spending the summer at 
an archaeological dig in Pittsburg, 
Texas. She recalls that when locals 
asked members of her research 
team about their excavation, the 
questions were not taken seriously. 
"One day in a store they asked 
some of us if we had found any 
diamonds," Pyburn says. "Their 
idea about Ihe work of archaeolo- 
gists was that we look for things to 
sell. Instead of acknowledging that 
they were interested, we laughed 



at them. If only had engaged 
them in what we were doing. The 
members of that community were 
perfectly bright, intelligent people 
who just happened not to know 
much about archaeology. We need 
to encourage the interest of people 
living near archaeological sites." 

No longer will Pyburn disregard 
the concerns and interests of the 
people most immediately affected 
by an archaeological dig in their 
midst. Pyburn, an assistant 
professor of anthropology on the 
Indianapolis campus and a research 
associate at lU Bloomington's 
William Hammond Mathers 



Museum, is now embarking on two 
projects founded on the principle of 
community in\'olvement. 

The first is the excavation 
of Ciiau I liix, an extraordinarily 
well-preserved grouping of Maya 
ruins in the north eentnd region of 
Belize, a former British colony. 
The second is the Project for 
Archaeology in the Public Interest, 
an effort by Pyburn and her 
husband, lU Bloomingttin associate 
professor of anthropology Richard 
Wilk, to foster an approach to their 
discipline that seeks participation 
by — and benefits for — community 
members. 

Since Pyburn and Wilk were 
first entrusted with information 
about the location of Chau 1 lii* 
apprciximately throe years ago, tiie 
story of their "discovery" has been 
covered extensively in lU and 
Indianapolis publications and on 
local television. Residents of the 
Beli/ean village of Crooked Tree, 
an area where Wilk had conducted 
ethnographic studies for several 
years, eventually placed such 
confidence in the tvvc^ 
anthropologists that they led them 
to the site, which had previously 
been unknown to the outside 
world. It was the Crawford family 
of Crooked Tree, Rudy and C Gloria 
Crawford and their children, who 
decided to share the local secret 
after Rudy Crawford had 
thoroughly researched 
archaeological issues. The 
Crawfords and their neighbors 
hope that Pyburn will help 
preserve the site while bringing 
about economic benefits for the 
struggling village. 

An hour's motorboat ride from 
Crcioked Tree, among a ma/e of 
interconnected lagoons and flat, 
thickly vegetated islands, Chau 
Hiix rises from the jungle — 
enveloped by earth and vines, but 
still obviously the remains of a city.

Tlic temple at Altun Ha i^we^ an idea of what the temple at Chau Hiix may look like. The CJiau Hiix site is betiveen Altun 
Ha and Lamanai, tivo loell-hiown archaeological sites already excavated. 



According to Pyburn, who hns 
worked in places ranging from 
Arizona to Yemen, Chau Hiix is a 
marvel because it apparently has 
never been looted. Among the 28 
structures at the site — including 
several palaces and a ball court — 
Pyburn has found incense burners, 
figurines, tools, and weapons 
literally scattered about on the 
jungle floor. Looking through 
rodent burrows in the mound of 
earth that covers the 70- foot palace, 
she has seen the red -pa in ted walls 
of the structures themselves. 

While observing the site, Pyburn 
and other visitors are also being 
observed — by howler monkeys, 
hummingbirds, coatimundis, 
kinkajous, and even a rare 
jaguarundi. It was this creature, 
a small wildcat related to the 
jaguar, that inspired Pyburn when 
she named the site; Chau Hiix is the 
word for the jaguarundi in Kekchi, 
a Maya language spoken in Belize, 

Pyburn is aware of more than 
the twittering and screeching 
of wildlife at Chau Hiix, In an 
interview with Sandy Matthys 



Roob of Indiana University-Purdue 
University Indianapolis Media 
Relations, who accompanied 
Pyburn to the site in March of 1992, 
Pyburn said, "When you come 
away from Chau Hiix, it's not like 
you've been for a walk in the forest. 
You feel like you've been to a place 
that has a presence. . . . The things 
we find here on the ground 
immediately connect us with the 
last Maya people who were living 
here, working here, thinking here, 
and doing Maya things here." 
Pyburn estimates that human 
occupation began at the site in the 
Early Preclassic Period of Maya 
history (ca, 150 B.C.) and ended 
in the early 1500s — the time of the 
European conquest. 

Pyburn's passion for conserving 
th ."^ historical, environmental, and 
spiritual value of Chau Hiix has led 
hor to an intense search for funding 
of the excavation. A recipient of a 
1991 lUPUI Outstanding Young 
Faculty Award, Pyburn devoted 
an entire semester to writing grant 
proposals and speaking to groups 
about the project. Racing against 



time, she often worries about 
looting, the environmental impact 
of the discovery, and the possibility 
that people in Crooked Tree will 
become disillusioned about the 
project. Despite these unknowns, 
she remains hopeful. "I see the 
environment in Belize deteriorating 
rapidly," she says. "Refugees are 
flooding into the country from EI 
Salvador and Honduras. Crime has 
increased. Yet somehow Crooked 
Tree has given me hope." 

Pyburn says the optimism and 
constructive energy of the residents 
of Crooked Tree, qualities that 
typify the Belizean national 
character, arc what make her 
hopeful. Belize is multicultural, 
populated by Hispanic lericans, 
Asian Americans, African 
Americans (such as the Crawfords), 
and Native Americans, among 
others, and though it grapples with 
a low p^er capita income and high 
infant mortality, the country boasts 
a literacy rate estimated as high as 
90 percent. "Belizeans not only 
know how to read, they do read," 
Pyburn says. "Perhaps some of 



27 



that is tho legocy of the? British 
school system, but the I3ritish 
hdve been gone for ten years 
now. Beli/eans I have known 
put a tremendous emphasis on 
education, at the government level 
and in families." She attributes 
the Craw fords' wisdom in the 
protection of Chau Hiix to this fact, 
and she intends for their prudence 
to be rewarded with jobs for people 
in the Crooked Tree area — both in 
the excavation of the site and in the 
ttnirist industry that she hopes will 
develop around the excavation. 
"Chau 1 fiix is an ama/ingly 
pristine and lovely place," Pyburn 
Scivs. "These people have foregone 
short-term gain, and now they 
should get some reward for 
their selflessness," 

I'yburn also is eager to conduct 
research related to her own 
interests at Chau Hiix. A specialist 
in the rise of civilization, she 
hopes to track the development of 
economic classes among the Maya 
who inhabited the site. She also 
hopes to test her preliminary 
theories about how the city 
functioned economically in relation 
to two previously kntnvn Maya 
cities in the area— Altun Ha, 35 
miles to the east, and Lamanai, 
100 miles to the west, 

Pvburn's inquiry into social 
class formation and economic 
relationships in Maya societies 
began in graduate school at the 
University of Arizona. Her 
dissertation documented the 
settlement excavation of Nohmul, 
an archaeological site in northern 
I5elize, and provided new evidence 
about how the culture's stKial 
classes mav have evolved, I'yburn 
says that because poor people 
leave little nonperishable 
material behind, evidence of 
their settlements is difficult for 
archaeologists to locate, especially 
in the tropics !,(HH) vears after their 
deaths, "(^ne might argue that 
vtui're not going to find this 
evidence at all," she admits. At 
Nohmul, however, Pvburn did 
discover traces of the dwellings 
of ordinary people, "Kven people 
who did not have very much 
material wealth built their small 
perishable hmises with floors made 



of packed marl, a chalky limestone 
that occurs naturally in the region. 
Since the natural soil is black, you 
can see white floors in a black 
matrix," She jokes, "It was 
undeniable — your basic black-and- 
white evidence." 

Pvburn adds that the locations of 
these modest houses changed o\'er 
time, "The earliest ones I found, 
from the Preclassic Period, 300 A,D. 
at the latest, were scattered all over 
the site. There is a big 'downtown' 
area in the site, and there were lots 
of big houses on platforms and 
little houses not on platforms. 
Then by about 450 A.D. the bigger 
houses were clumped together 
instead of being spread out, and 
around the clumps of bigger houses 
were small clusters of poor people's 
houses. There is a kinship structure 
to the clusters, 

"In the very late period of occu- 
pation of the site, about 1000 A.D„ 
bigger houses began to be located 
near the dc)wntown area," Pyburn 
savs. "But the little houses dating 
from this period are pushed awMy 
from the site center, and they form 
their own little cluster on the 
edge of an area where intensive 
agriculture was practiced." This 
form of agriculture, based on 
reclaiming swamp lands, is thought 
to be highly productive, Pyburn 
says, so it is probable that the 
farmers were producing food not 
only for themselves but also for 
the people who lived in the larger 
hcHises, "1 saw a shift over time 
horn a kinship-based organization 
to an eccMiomically differentiated 
stK'ietv in which there was the 
development of a class of poor 
people. As society changes and 
becomes more cc^mplcK, the way 
people are organized changes. 
Where classes come from is a pc)int 
of theoretical debate, but what the 
pattern of change at Nohnuil 
indicated to me was that economic 
change created economically based 
class stratificaticMi," 

Pvburn plans to study the top 
o\ the class structure at Chau Hiix, 
"I want to find out it the elites at 
Chau Hiix were elite for more than 
one reason," she says, "In looking 
at the artifacts oi the palaces, I will 
be asking, 'Are they the results of 





M/7/' s/iorc/ny Crooked Tnr in rchUio}} 
to Aituii hlo. CJmti mix /s 35 niilc^ 
ursf ofAltun Ha. 



specialists in manufacturing, or 
are they related to specialists in 
ideology? Are they related to the 
iconography of the site next door, 
or are they related to the elites' 
paraphernalia in outlying palaces 
at the same site? Does the ratio of 
palaces downtown to palaces out 
of town change over time? Is the 
wealth being produced strictly 
from the land, or are there other 
sources of wealth and prestige and 
power, such as trade, specialization 
in manufacturing, or control of 
religious symbols and ideology?'" 

Pyburn also wonders if there is 
evidence of warfare, "There is a 
carved jade plaque from Altun Ha 
claiming that AUim Ha was 
conquered by the CIuk Pnx [lord I 
from the west, and Chau Hiix is to 
the west," she s^iys. It is too early 
to determine what the two sites' 
relationship over time may ha\'e 
been, but Pyburn has noticed 
certain distinctions. "1 think 
there are some differences in the 
continuity of occupation of the 
two sites," she says. "Chau Hiix 
apparently had heavier occupation 
than Altun Ha in later periods," 

Pvburn expects the excavation 
and reconstruction of Chau Hiix to

(In Decern bor i)f Idst yt\ir she 
received word thnt the National 
Science Foundntion would fund 
the first season of the project.) 
Pvburn's team will work with 
wildlife biologist David Stead man 
o\' the New York Museum of 
Natural History and a landscape 
architect. "I think there are creative 
ways that we could make the 
buildings stable enough that 
thousands of tourists could walk 
over them without our having to 
cut down all the trees/' she says. 
During the excavation, various 
ancillary projects are certain to 
develop. Already Pyhurn and 
Wilk have established education 
and scholarship opportunities for 
Beli/ean youths. They have also 
arranged for used textbooks 
donated from Indiana schools to 
be sent to the government school 
at Crooked Tree, where Dacia 
Crawford, the oldest daughter 
of Rudy and Gloria Crawford, 
is the principal. 

This commitment to conducting 
public-oriented archaeology led 
Pyburn and Wilk to found the 
Project for Archaeology in the 



Public Interest in 1992. The project 
has preliminary funding from 
internal grants at lUPUl. In 
addition to their own experiences 
at Chau Hiix, archaeological events 
around the world have further 
persuaded Pyburn and Wilk of 
the value of such a project. One 
occurrence was Ihe Wood Quav 
incident in Dublin, in which Viking 
artifacts were uncovered in an area 
where developers were planning 
to build a bank. "The local 
community hcMrd about the 
archaeological site and had a 
fit," Pyburn says. The citizens 
staged protests, hired their own 
archaeologist, and volunteered 
to excavate the site themselves. 
They proved the historical value 
of the site and revitalized their 
Cf)mmunity, even though the site 
was eventually destroyed. 

Another case that inspired 
Pyburn was a transformation 
that took place at an Ecuadorian 
archaeological site where looting 
had been a problem. Many people, 
including some archaeologists, do 
not understand that most looters 
are driven by need, Pyburn says. 
Locals remove artifacts from sites 



and, in order to buy food and other 
necessities, sell them to buyers, 
who often come from outside 
the community. In Ecuador 
archaeologists have offered former 
looters the opportunity to become 
professional tour guides. Perhaps 
the Project for Archaeology in the 
Public Interest will encourage more 
archaeologists to consider the local 
economic climate, says Pyburn, 
who has found it hard not to 
sympathize with looters after 
"being in Belize and knowing 
that people were destroying their 
archaeological heritage because 
they were hungry." 

Sensitivity to local needs and 
interests informs the research 
design of a recently proposed study 
by the Project for Archaeology in 
the Public Interest. Researchers 
will investigate the history of 
African Americans in Indianapolis, 
excavating in the Ransom Place 
neighborhood, on the near north- 
west side of downtown. This area 
has a long history as a cultural 
center of the Indianapolis African 
American community; it was 
witness to dramatic changes in the 
economic and social opportunities 



29 



open to African Americans in the 
city. "Understanding how that 
process was interrelated with 
the economy of Indianapolis is 
an intellectual question that is 
intriguing to me and might be 
interesting to members of the 
African American comnumity of 
Indianapolis today/' Pyburn says. 

"The key to the success of the 
project lies in community interest 
and input/' Pyburn says. She 
hopes to work with Crispus 
Attucks High School and a variety 
of local civic and cultural groups, 
as well as with residents of the 
Ransom Place neighborhood, to 
develop a research design that has 
both academic significance and 
practical value. "Most people 
think archaeology is just Anglo 
Americans digging up Native 
Americans, with no relevance 
for real life. We as archaeologists 
must do a better job of promoting 
the kinds of knowledge that our 
discipline has to offer, not just 
so people will want to conserve 
archaeological resiiurces, but so 
more kinds of people will be 
attracted to the discipline. We 
need a multiethnic constituency. 
Non white archaeologists are 
very rare in the United States. 
Nevertheless, the prehistory 
and history of ethnic groups are 
extremely important fields that 
should not be written only b\' 
Anglo Americans." Jean Spears, 
a historian who lives in Ransom 
Place, will coordinate the 
investigation with community 
interests. "Up to now, ail the 
enthusiasm and direction of the 
project has come through Jean/' 
Pyburn says. 

Undertakings such as the 
Project for Archaeology in the 
Public interest fulfill Py burn's 
earliest dreams of a career based 
on scientific and sociological 
inquiry. Her father was a field 
biologist and her mother a social 
worker with a keen interest in 
archaeology. Spending summers 
in remote parts of Mexico and 
Colombia seemed natural to 
Pyburn. "I grew up thinking 
field work was a part of 
everybody's life," she says. 



''I saw a shift over 
time from a kinship- 
based organization to 
an economically 
differentiated society in 
which there was the 
development of 
a class of poor people " 

Now Pyburn encourages girls 
and young women to consider 
scientific careers. "The quality 
of our discipline is diminished by 
the shortage of females/' she says. 
She has noticed that women in 
anthropology tend to elicit new 
kinds of information from the 
societies they study. In support 
of this observation she cites 
changes over time as increasing 
numbers of female anthropologists 
have contributed to the scholarship 
on traditional hunting-and- 
gathering societies. "For fifty 
years we had a model of 'man the 
lumter/" Pyburn says. "There was 
a vision that the rnen brought home 
all the food, and the women stood 
around and waited and kept the 
fire going." 

Fven before the number of 
women in the discipline had grown 
significantly, male ethnographers 
were finding that men in these 
societies actually hunted at widely 
spaced intervals, and that women 
caught small game and collected 
vegetables. But after delineating 
more clearly the function of 
women in these societies, male 
ethnographers still had difficulty 
interpreting the women's actions 
because a lack of rapport 
often existed. Then female 
anthropologists began recording 
these same actions. "Observed 
by another woman, what these 
women were doing seemed much 
more concise and organizc\i and 
purposeful," Pyburn says. "And 
now we know that, yes, in most 
of these societies men do hunt, 
but that's not even half the story 
of people's diets. In fact, societies 




are much more interesting when 
you look at both what men do and 
what women do/' But women's 
contributions to anthropology 
are not limited to domestic issues. 
Pyburn says women now also ask 
the "big questions," as she does, 
about "big things," such as the 
rise of civilization. 

Pyburn 's most satisfying 
professional experiences come 
about whenever she is opening 
up her discipline — to local 
inhabitants near archaeological 
sites, to women, to traditionally 
underrepresented ethnic groups, 
or to students who are taking an 
archaeology course as an elective. 
She recalls her first semester at 
lUPUI, in the fall of 1990, when 
she enjoyed what she considers an 
ideal classroom situation. "I taught 
a night class in Mesoamerican 
archaeology to a group of 
undergraduates/' she says. "Many 
of the students had full-time jobs 
and relatively little time to devote 
to course u\)rk. Most of them came 
in wearing their business clothes. 
All of them were there because 
they wanted to be. They were not 
bored, they asked lots of questions, 
and we had a spectacular time. It 
was the kind of class I like to teach. 
I ximut to be interrupted." Pyburn 
will be conducting a field school 
at Chau Hiix in 1994 and hopes to 
include nontraditional students in 
tlie program. "It's the nonmajors 
for wliom 1 feel it's most important 
to have a chance to expand their 
horizons," she says. "It really 
changes people to be in another 
country for three or four months, 
digging holes, living in a different 
way. 1 get a tremendous charge 
watching the ways people develop 
under those circumstances." 

This spirit of inclusiveness 
pervades Pyburn's teaching and 
her research efforts. "Nobody 
owns the past, and 1 don't want 
to own somebody else's past," she 
says. But I think the past is valu- 
able, and I like the idea of helping 
people get access to it — to their past 
and their heritage, but also to the 
past in general. I don't think you 
have to be a Maya to get value from 
understanding Mayas."

News from the Frontier 



Emilio Mornii, Professor 
of All fit n J/ n )/( \^\/ . hid in / m 
ihiivcr^itif Blooitiiti^iott 




c 

eated comfortably in his 
Bkximington office, EmiHo Mo ran 
leans back in his chair, 
fingertips pressed together, and 
observes the image flickering on 
the computer screen on his desk. 
That image represents one step 
in his latest research project, a 
large-scale study of secondary 
growth following deforestation in 
the Amazon rain forest. By using 
both satellite data and detailed 
information from field research, 
Moran hopes to define the social, 
economic, biological, and 
geographical characteristics of 
regrowth in different regions 
within the Aniczon basin. 

Moran, Indiana University 
professor of anthropology, 
and graduate assistant Fduardo 
Hrondizio have spent this academic 
year analyzing the data from 



satellite pictures and field research, 
which they and three Brazilian 
collaborators gathered in Brazil 
during the summer of 1^92. Their 
work is supported by the National 
Science Foundation (NSF) and the 
Department of Hnergy. The study 
is expected to take at least 10 yoars 
as it moves from current sites to 
different environmental zones in 
the Amazon. 

Moran took the first step toward 
his present project in 1987, when 
he attended an NSF-sponsored 
workshop on the applications 
of remote sensing to ecological 
anthropology. At the workshop, 
conferees were exposed to the 
possible benefits of using satellite 
sensors in their work. When 
asked about ways to apply the 
new technology to their research, 
Moran immediately saw numerous 
possibilities. "1 was very excited," 
recalls Moran, "because we all 



came up with a number of 
questions that we had ahvays 
wanted to address but had ne\'er 
been able to — because there was 
no technical \vay to do it." Kach 
of the 12 scholars at the workshop 
suggested ways to apply this 
new technology. 

Two years passed before Moran 
was able to turn his attention to the 
goal of applying the technology. 
He received a Fulbright Award in 
1989 and a Guggenheim Fellowship 
in 1989-1990 to write a book in 
Portuguese on the ecology of the 
Amazon, A Ecolo^in Humana iia> 
Popu lawn's da Aniazouia. The book 
was published in Brazil in 1990; 
a revised English edition will 
be published this year by the 
University of lo\va Press under 
the title T//n)//^\j/j Ajiuizoiiian /,i/rs: 
The Human Ecolo^xj o\ Amazouiau 
Popiilafio}i>, As part of his 
Fulbright responsibilities in 
Brazil, Moran taught two intensive 
graduate human ecology courses 
based on themes in the book. 
Another research grant sent him 
and nine graduate students back to 
the Amazon to study the strategies 
of land use at Marajo Island, a delta 
at the mouth of the Amazon. Three 
of these nine students are now 
graduate students at lU. 

While Moran was in Brazil 
in 1989, media coverage of the 
deforestation of the Amazon was 
at its peak. "There was tremendous 
pressure on Brazil," he says. "To 
me, a lot of it didn't ring true. In 
almost every farm in the Amazon 
where 1 had worked, farmers wore 
concerned less with deforestation 
than with the fact that the forest 
grew back too quickly. You burn 
the forest, and within thirty days 
you get regrowth and resprouting 
of trees." These findings contrasted 
with the »^»'evailing view that 
deforestec areas became deserts. 

Here was an opportunity, 
finally, to use the technology he 
had been exposed to in the 1987 
workshop. Moran was convinced 



28 



31 



Aimzon rain forest 



that he had a case, and he was 
optimistic that satclHte data on 
regrowth would substantiate his 
earlier observations. "I knew about 
regrowth/' he explains. "But if 1 
were to talk about regrowth, people 
would question it. People would 
say, well, yes, in your village, but 
that's not true elsewhere." 

Moran selected several areas 
in the Amazon rain forest that 
had been cleared. He has been 
following their progress over time, 
"hi particular, 1 will be looking for 
areas that have unnatural rates of 
regrowth, either too fast or too 
slow," lie says. "Then, by going 
into the field, I will find out what 
those people are doing that 
accelerates or retards regrowth." 
He is also analyzing factors such 
as soil quality, how the land is 
being used, and the size of the 
area cleared. 

Although se\'eral interpretations 
of what is happening in the 
Amazon basin exist, there has been 
no reliable way to assess them. But 
since Moran's sampling approach 
is scaled into distinct units 
representative of rich to poor 
soil quality, it can be used to 
reconstruct the larger picture of 
what is happening in the Amazon 
basin. "With the satellite data," 
explains Moran, "we can clearly 
see how much land is cleared, how 



much is growing back, and how 
much is not growing." Projected 
to last seven to ten years, this is 
the most extensive study that has 
been conducted on regrowth in the 
Amazon and the first to use satellite 
data and field studies across a 
broad temporal and spatial 
scale. It is a new approach to 
understanding the dynamics of 
the Amazon rain forest, and Moran 
initially felt some concern about its 
reception. "My biggest worry was 
that a lot of people didn't want to 
hear about forest regrowth," Moran 
says. "There was so much interest 
in, and support for, stopping 
deforestation that 1 was afraid they 
might interpret this project as my 
saying that it's not so bad, which 
is not what I was saying at all. 
I was saying that some regions 
are resilient and others extremely 
fragile — and that we had to pay 
attention to these differences. 
If the forest is growing back, we 
need to account for its variable rate 
and the variables responsible for 
recovery and degradation. 

Yet Moran's project was 
positively received, partly 
because of his stature in the 
anthropological and Amazonian 
studies communities. Moran 
played a leading role in pointing 
out the diversity of the Amazon 
basin in the 1970s, when the basin 



was thought to be homogeneous. 
The Amazon basin is a huge 
land mass, containing myriad 
ecosystems — each with different 
climates, soils, and human 
histories. For 20 years Moran's 
research has been focused on ways 
to wisely monitor human influence 
on this rich, widely di\'ersified 
land. He has opposed "treating 
people as a lumpen proletariat 
and treating the Amazon as 
undifferentiated," by empirically 
demonstrating social and 
environmental di\'ersity. These 
newest research activities reveal 
a natural progression from his 
earlier studies. 

Moran's interests have always 
spanned traditional barriers 
among disciplines. His bachelor's 
degree in Spanish literature from 
Spring Hill College in Mobile, 
Alabama, was more a function of 
circumstance than choice. "Spring 
Hill was a small liberal arts school 
and had a stronger literature 
program than history program, 
so 1 majored in literature with 
course work equivalent to a history 
major's," he explains. Even after 
earning a master's degree in Latin 
American history at the University 
of Florida in Gainesville, Moran 
was still searching for a field in 
which he could deal with the 
human condition. "I knew that 1

didn't Wtint to continue in history/' 
he recalls, "not because I no longer 
valued or was interested in history, 
but because I wanted to become 
more actively involved in the 
social issues I had come across, 
such as slavery and economic 
development." Although he 
knew that he was interested in the 
development of South America, he 
was not sure of the best way to 
pursue that interest. Still seeking 
a discipline that met his needs, he 
took courses in economics at the 
University of North Carolina at 
Chapel Hill. 

Moran's quandary was that 
he wanted to study patterns of 
development in South America at 
a time when economic scholarship 
in that area was limited. "I didn't 
know whether I really wanted to 
be in economics, given that I 
was interested in development 



economics/' says Moran. "At the 
time, there wasn't such a thing. A 
few early articles were beginning 
to come out, but the rest of the field 
didn't know about it or \'alue it. 
My adviser in economics admitted 
the inadequacies of neoclassical 
theory for the questions I posed." 

The Latin American studies 
director at the University of 
Florida, William Carter, suggested 
that Moran investigate economic 
and ecological anthropology- Later 
Moran learned that the University 
of Florida had hired Charles 
Wagley, the Franz Boas Professor in 
the Department of Anthropology at 
Columbia University. Wagley was 
one of the most highly respected 
scholars in Latin American and 
Brazilian studies. The opportunity 
to work with him coincided with 
the offer of a fellowship, and 
Moran returned to Florida. 



At that stage, Moran's interests 
still lay elsewhere in Brazil, not in 
the Amazon basin. "All the key 
investigations were going on in the 
southern and northeastern parts of 
Brazil," he explains. "The Amazon 
was not even discussed except by 
a few anthropologists who were 
looking at symbolism, kinship, 
and other topics." 

But that situation was soon 
to change. Wagley was invited 
to Brazil for a major international 
conference. When he returned to 
the University of Florida after 
attending the conference, Wagley 
gave a colloquium, which Moran 
attended, on changes occurring 
in the Amazon. During the 
colloquium Wagley spoke about 
a new program to open up the 
Amazon by means of highways. 
A road was being built to attract 
people from all over Brazil to the 
Amazon. Hundreds of thousands 
of families would be relocated 
over a period of only five years. 
It was unknown territory — 
geographically, culturally, 
and economically. 

During the colloquium, Wagley 
made nis feelings clear: to him, 
the building of the highway was 
the most important thing that 
was happening in South America, 
in both social and ecological 
terms. Moran was immediately 
captivated. "The next day I 
volunteered to go," he says. "1 felt 
that this was a chance to deal with 
issues of significance to the public. 
If anthropology had something to 
say, something that could influence 
the social and environmental 
impact of the highway and the 
engineering decisions behind 
its construction, then an 
anthropologist ought to be there 
to study the highway project/' 

But volunteering to go to the 
Amazon was not enough, Moran 
had to prepare by taking courses 
in a variety of earth sciences. "To 
deal with the issues in the Amazon, 
to understand the environmental 
impact, you had to know ecology," 
Moran explains. "You had to 
know something about soils, 
about geography, about

agronomy." Moran had finally 
found his focus, in both a 
geographic and a scholarly SLMise. 
"Anthropologists spend a lot of 
time looking at people, asking what 
their side of the story is and then 
studying it scientifically/' he says. 

Moran was about to enter one of 
the most dynamic and controversial 
arguments in anthropology. For 
30 years anthropologists had been 
debating whether the Amazon 
could support societies using 
intensive agriculture. Some 
archaeologists had asserted, 
since the 1950s, that the soils in 
the Amazon were too poor to 
support a complex society. 

Moran's research sent him back 
to this big question: were there 
adequate soils in the Amazon? 
They had been described as 
uniformly poor, yet he found a 
surprising amount of variation in 
soils. "There were significant areas 
of extremely rich soils, the best 
anyone could want," he says. 
"These soils were very deep, and 
very good." But there were also 
very poor soils throughout the 
area, and farmers had to adjust 
to variations within the region. 

"You don't adapt to a region," 
Moran explains, "you adapt to 
very specific resources within that 
region. Things like drainage, the 
amount of rainfall, the right soil 
type for a given crop." For 
instance, he found that some plant 
species grew only in better soils. 
That meant that local indigenous 
people who were familiar with 
plant life in a certain area were 
often better able to pick out richer 
soils than trained soil scientists. 
Other plants could thrive even in 
poor soils. Crop choice was no 
less significant than soil choice. 

In the course of his research, 
Moran showed why not all farmers 
succeeded. Some immigrants, 
for example, used tree height and 
width as indicators of good soil 
type. They assumed that taller, 
wider trees indicated richer soils. 
Even though this method had 
been widely usod — for example, 
it was also employed on the 
North American frontier — it 
was unreliable, Moran says. 



"It might work somewhere," he 
acknowledges, "but it certainly 
didn't work very well in either of 
those areas. In fact, the larger the 
tree and the wider its diameter, 
the poorer the soil." So people who 
relied on tree size as an indicator 
chose exactly the opposite of what 
they were trying to select. 

Farming success depended not 
only on the nature of the land being 
farmed, but also on the complex 
relationship between the farmer 
and the land. Moran found that 
certain kinds of experience, 
not necessarily with soils and 
agricultural production, tended 
to influence a farmer's success. 
Most researchers had assumed 
that people from the more affluent 
southern part of Brazil would be 
better farmers than those from the 
impoverished northeast. Yet 
Moran's research clearly showed 
that the agricultural practices in the 
south were not appropriate models 
for better farming in the Amazon. 
Tellingly, the southern farmers 
fared worse than those who already 
knew the area. 

The most successful farmers 
had formerly owned or managed 
private property. Others, who 
had not previously had decision- 
making authority, were not able to 
handle the credit they received and 
spent it on consumer goods instead 
of using it to increase production. 
Nor were people who were new to 
large-scale production able to gain 
as n^uch from the labor of hired 



help, because these farmers 
wer -^ot accustomed to giving 
orders and keeping track of 
people's effort. 

After 14 months in the Amazon, 
Moran returned to Gainesville, 
completed his dissertation, and 
joined the lU faculty. After several 
more trips and more reflection, he 
wrote a book that gave an account 
of this work. Developing the Amazon 
was published by Indiana 
University Press in 1981. 

In 1984 Moran returned to the 
Amazon as a Tinker Foundation 
fellow to look at community 
formation. His interests had 
turned to the development of the 
social order in frontier societies — 
how they came to be in the first 
place. Moran explains, "If you take 
any community, at some point in 
history it doesn't exist. The organi- 
zation's structure comes out of the 
interaction of individualb anci 
families during the beginning. 
Who determines the rules of the 
game? Who decides on the proper 
rules and laws? How do things 
end up being traditions? All this 
is negotiated by early settlers." 

Moran had found a perfect 
place to examine social issues. He 
began asking questions about how 
people negotiate their political and 
economic arrangements. Who 
emerges as the leader, the patron, 
the client? Do people really get 
ahead on the frontier?

Drawing on his background 
as a historian, Moran found an 
interesting parallel in the history 
of the United States frontier. The 
people who fared best on the 
North American forested frontiers 
arrived during the first five to 
ten years and had certain kinds 
of experience. "Not everybody 
goes to the frontier the first day/' 
explains Moran. "You tend to have 
poorer, younger people, but not the 
poorest of the poor. There are a 
limited number of spaces available, 
so if you get there too late, there's 
no more room." So those settlers 
who prospered earlier had more 
sustained success than those, 
however wealthy, who 
arrived later. 

Parallels betw^een the early 
North American frontier and the 
ongoing settlement of the Amazon 
are apparent. But there is one 
major difference, and that has to 
do with the level of governmental 
involvement. The United States 
had a tradition of local community 
control, which gave pioneers 
freedom to constmct their own 
political organization and local 
taxation. In Brazil, however, there 
is greater federal authority and 
more centralized control. Moran 
wondered how this difference 
would affect settlers' efforts. 
Although he found that greater 
federal control did limit the success 
of individual pioneers, there were 
still individuals who were able to 
do well and move into positions 
of power within the community. 

Currently, Moran is involved in 
several projects connected to his 
research agenda, which include 
chairing the American 
Anthropological Association's 
Task Force on the Environment. 
Throughout his career, Moran has 
combined social and earth sciences, 
providing a prime example of the 
interdisciplinary potential of 
ecological research. As chairman 
of this task force, Moran has been 
able to do more than set an 
example — he had the opportunity 
at a National Research Council 
hearing in early 1992 to voice 
his feelings about spanning 
disciplinary boundaries. 
According to Moran, we must 




Lc\^ofor tJie Atithropolo^ical Center 
for Training and Research on Global 
Environmental Chan<^e 

overcome this current limitation on 
environmental research. "We can 
understand the human dimensions 
of global change only if we 
understand the total human 
enviroment," explains Moran. 

Moran hopes that a forum for 
interactions between the earth and 
social sciences will be created in the 
proposed National Institutes for the 
Environment (NIE), a governing 
body of environmental studies 
that would support research on the 
environment. Legislation for the 
NIE has been scheduled to come 
before Congress this spring. 
The American Anthropological 
Association, with Moran as its 
major spokesperson, stood 
behind the formation of such an 
organization, provided, Moran 
says, "the institutes overcome 
the tendency to define research 
in terms of disciplinary priority 
rather than in terms of a coherent, 
interdisciplinary approach 
to pervasive environmental 
problems." The NIE that Moran 
envisions will support an 
interdisciplinary, comprehensive, 
problem-oriented research agenda, 
one that will allow social and 
earth scientists to work together. 
"We're beginning to open up to 
teamwork," he says. "As we 
become more comfortable with 
team research, we're discovering 
how much more we can learn 
by working together, and how 
much more credible our 
research becomes." 

On a smaller but more 
immediate scale, Moran's 
interdisciplinary interests have led 
to the creation of one of the most 
innovative programs at Indiana 
University, the Anthropological 
Center for Training and Research 
on Global Environmental Change 
(ACT). With Moran as its director, 
ACT was approved by the 
university in March of 1992. 



Although its goal— to develop 
scholars — is a classic one, the 
methods and philosophy behind 
ACT are new. Scholars at the 
center will learn to approach 
environmental research in a way 
that is both international and 
interdisciplinary, focusing on 
the human side of global 
environmental change and 
keeping in mind the concerns of 
local populations in the geographic 
areas under study. A statement 
of ACT'S mission proclaims the 
center's intention to "think 
globally, act locally" in its 
research and training activities. 

Moran envisions ACT as a 
place where researchers can learn 
to use new technology and research 
methods to carry on their work. 
Researchers from all disciplines 
will use computerized network 
and geographical mapping 
systems, and record and interpret 
satellite data as complements to 
other techniques already in use. 

Eventually, Moran hopes, the 
center will fill a gap between the 
earth and social sciences. "Most 
researchers active in the earth 
sciences don't know how to 
collaborate and use the theories 
and ideas of the social sciences," he 
says. "Most social scientists, on the 
other hand, are unfamiliar with 
the technological and empirical 
nature of data offered by the earth 
sciences. I hope that places such 
as the center will make them both 
more receptive to each other and 
able to conceive research that is of 
more than disciplinary interest. 
We are formulating research and 
training programs to achieve 
these goals." 

ACT has received a positive 
international response. "We've 
already had researchers from 
Japan, India, Africa, the United 
States, and Brazil indicate 
that they are eager to come for 
training," says Moran. "As scon 
as we prepare the space and 
equipment, our facilities will be full 
immediately." What better proof 
of the need for ACT than a waiting 
list? And what better director for 
the center than Emilio Moran?
