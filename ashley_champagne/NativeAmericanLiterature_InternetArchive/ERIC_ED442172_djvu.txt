Before the world was 



created, people lived on 
an isl and in the sky. 



.Below,. there was only 
wnterrA woman fell? 



through a bole in the 
sky island. Swans 



caught her with their 



wings. A muskrat dived 



to the bottom of the 



water and brought up 



some mud. which other 



animals spread on the 



back of the Big Turtle. 



The mud grew into an 



island large enough for 



the womaii to live on- 



Turtle Island, or North 



America. According to 



this legend, the land 
still rests upon the shell 



of the Turtle -An 



Iroquois Creation Story 



The figures on pages 



2, 4, 6, and 7 are 



outlines for shadow 



puppets. You can cut 



them out, or trace 



them onto paper or 



cardboard first. (Use a 



hole punch for eyes.) 



These outlines are 



some of the characters 



you will meet in Turtle 



Island Tales. After the 



performance, you can 



re-tell the stories with 



your puppets, or make 



up your own stories

Shadow Puppets 

Shadow puppet shows (or shadow plays) from Asia are the oldest 
form of puppet theater. You will see both shadow and rod puppets in 
Turtle Island Tales. The shadow puppet is a flat cutout that is held against 
a screen and lighted by a lamp from behind. A rod puppet is controlled by 
the long, thin rods attached to it. Turtle Island Tales also uses a life-size 
puppet made of foam rubber. Puppeteer Hobey Ford thinks of shadow 
plays as an early form of 





To make a shadow puppet 
stage, stretch a sheet over 
the cut-out end of a box (or 
over a wooden frame). 
Shine a light, such as a 
flashlight or slide projector, 
from behind. Darken the 
room. Hold the puppet 
close to the sheet so that 
your audience sees only its 
shadow. You are the 
puppeteer who moves the 
puppet and provides its 
voice.

All Native American^ 
tribes have legends^; 
and stories that were* 
told to explain things : 
that people didn't V: 
understand, such asif 
earthquakes, storms,# 
and seasons. Others 
stories told about 
gods and heroes 
and reminded 
people how they 
should act and what 
rules they should t 
follow. Some stories ' 
were told just for 
fun. Through stories, 
each generation 
passed its religion, 
ideas, and traditions^ 
to the next 
generation. Native 
American tales give 
information about a 
tribe's way of life, 
where they lived, the 
food they ate, and 
how they got their 
food. 

The stories in Turtle 
Island Tales are 
explained on pages 
2, 4, 6, and 7. They 
come from these four 
Native American 
Tribes.

The Puppeteer — Hobey Ford 

When Hobey Ford was in college, he took a trip to the western United 
States. On the way, he met a Native American family in Nevada. They were 
building a traditional Native American village in the desert. Mr. Ford stayed 
for two years and learned about their traditions, songs, and stories. In 
1980 , he started the Golden Rod Puppets. Since then, he has traveled all 
over the United States to perform. Mr. Ford and his family live in North 
Carolina. 



YOU MAY WANT TO 
READ: 



The Puppets — The Golden Rod Puppets 

In his shows, Hobey Ford uses many kinds of puppets — shadow puppets, 
rod puppets, hand puppets, and marionettes. Turtle Island Tales also uses a 
life-size puppet, made of foam rubber, as the storyteller.

The Audience — YOU 

A puppet performance is different from a movie or a television show. A 
puppeteer is in the same room with you, and is affected by what you do. 
This is how you can help: 

Listen and watch closely. 

Join in when you're invited. 

Laugh if something is funny. 

Clap for the stories you enjoy. 

Have fun!
