Abstract 

The island of Newfoundland Is unique because it has as many non-native terrestrial mammals as native ones. The impacts of 
non-native species on native flora and fauna can be profound and invasive species have been identified as one of the 
primary drivers of species extinction. Few studies, however, have investigated the effects of a non-native species 
assemblage on community and ecosystem properties. We reviewed the literature to build the first terrestrial mammal food 
web for the island of Newfoundland and then used network analyses to investigate how the timing of introductions and 
trophic position of non-native species has affected the structure of the terrestrial mammal food web in Newfoundland. The 
first non-native mammals (house mouse and brown rat) became established in Newfoundland with human settlement in 
the late is"^ and early 16* centuries. Coyotes and southern red-backed voles are the most recent mammals to establish 
themselves on the island in 1985 and 1998, respectively. The fraction of intermediate species increased with the addition of 
non-native mammals over time whereas the fraction of basal and top species declined over time. This increase in 
intermediate species mediated by non-native species arrivals led to an overall increase in the terrestrial mammal food web 
connectance and generality (i.e. mean number of prey per predator). This diverse prey base and sources of carrion may have 
facilitated the natural establishment of coyotes on the island. Also, there is some evidence that the introduction of non- 
native prey species such as the southern red-backed vole has contributed to the recovery of the threatened American 
marten. Long-term monitoring of the food web is required to understand and predict the impacts of the diverse novel 
interactions that are developing in the terrestrial mammal food web of Newfoundland.

Introduction 

Non-native species invasions are a major threat to the 
persistence of native biodiversity and ecosystem functioning [1- 
3]. The problem is pervasive as invasive species from most major 
taxonomic groups including plants (e.g. [4]), invertebrates (e.g. 
[5]), amphibians (e.g. [6]) and mammals (e.g. [7]) have established 
themselves in many of the World's biomes. The rate of biological 
invasions has increased with our increasing human footprint and 
in some regions the number of non-native species outnumbers the 
number of native ones. The majority of studies of biological 
invasions focus on how invasive species and recipient ecosystem 
traits influence the dispersal and establishment of one or a few 
non-native species [8] , [9] . Few studies, however have investigated 
the impacts of a community of non-native species on native 
populations and even fewer have addressed community and 
ecosystem properties [10], [11]. Consequently, there is a pressing 
need to understand and predict the impacts of non-native species 
assemblages on native community and ecosystem properties. 

The island of Newfoundland, Canada (Fig. 1) presents a case 
where the number of non-native and transient terrestrial mammals 
outnumbers the number of extant native terrestrial mammals. 



Specifically, there are 1 3 extant terrestrial mammal species native 
to the island compared to 1 3 non-native and 3 transient mammals 
to the island (Table 1). Native mammals include American Beaver 
{Castor canadensis), American Black Bear (Ursus americanus) and 
American Marten (Martes americana). The Grey Wolf {Canis 
lupus) is native to Newfoundland but was extirpated in the early 
1930s [12]. Among the introduced non-native mammals are the 
particularly abundant Red Squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus - 
introduced in 1963), Snowshoe Hare (Lepus americanus - 
introduced in 1864), and American Moose (Alces americanus - 
introduced in 1904). The Coyote {Canis latrans), arrived in 1985 
after crossing on ice from Nova Scotia and has established itself on 
the island through natural range expansion (Table 1). These 
invasive species may have a large role in the terrestrial mammal 
food web, where species such as moose may now be found at 
considerably high densities [13], [14]. In this study, we investi- 
gated the impact of the non-native mammal assemblage on the 
structural properties (e.g. link density, connectance) of the 
terrestrial mammal food web in Newfoundland. 

Compared with mainland regions, islands can be more 
susceptible to disturbances from the arrival of exotic species 
[15]. This is due in part to fewer species, lack of natural parasites

Non-Native Species Impacts on a Native Food Web

or predators, more endemic species, and simpler food webs on 
islands [16]. These traits have generally led to higher rates of 
species extinctions in insular ecosystems [16], [17]. Biological 
invasion is advanced as one of the leading causes of biodiversity 
loss and disturbance on island ecosystems [18]. Specifically, the 
introduction of non-native mammals can have significant impacts 
on the flora and fauna of insular ecosystems [19], [20]. For 
instance, the introduction of the Small Asian Mongoose [Urva 
auropunctata) to Mauritius, Fiji, West Indies, Caribbean islands, 
and Hawai'i has been catastrophic for some species endemic to 
these islands. Originally introduced to control rat populations, this 
non-native mammal has preyed heavily on native fauna [21]. In 
the Caribbean islands alone, the decline or extinction of 14 of 16 
skink species can be attributed to the Small Asian Mongoose [22] . 
Multiple evolutionary explanations exist for why insular species 
are sensitive to disturbances from aUen species. For example, 
insular species may be maladapted for competing and co-existing 
with non-native species; evolution in geographic isolation may 
result in a lack of traits that facilitate persistence when subject to 
predation and interference pressures from non-native species [23]. 
Islands may also support an abundance of resources to allow the 



spread of non-native species. Therefore, non-native species may 
rapidly become estabhshed and proliferate in island ecosystems, 
often reaching abundances that are unsustainable within the 
environment [16]. Although Newfoundland is a continental island 
and not a "true" island (i.e. oceanic), there is evidence that 
biodiversity on continental islands also is susceptible to human 
disturbances such as species introductions (e.g. Australia) [24], 
[25]. 

Previous studies have proposed that the effects of non-native 
species on native food webs are mediated by trophic position 
(reviewed in [10]). Non-native predators may be especially 
detrimental for native biodiversity in some areas [25]. For 
example, a recent meta-analysis showed that non-native predators 
have a much larger negative effect on population size and 
reproduction of vertebrate prey than native predators [25]. 
Conversely, the introduction of non-native prey may confer 
positive effects on native predators as they can act as viable food 
sources (reviewed by [26]). 

The order of establishment of sequential species introductions 
also may influence how a non-native species assemblage affects a 
native food web [27], [28]. For example, Pope et al. [27] show

Non-Native Species Impacts on a Native Food Web 



that salmonids introduced to the Klamath Mountains region of 
California as early as the 1800s have facilitated the establishment 
and expansion of the non-native Pacific Coast Aquatic Garter 
Snake {Thamnophis ah'atus) with negative impacts on native 
Cascades Frogs [Rana cascadae). The idea of synergistic or 
facilitative interactions between non-native species is central to the 
concept of an "invasional meltdown" (sensu [29]) and evidence of 
an invasional meltdown has been demonstrated in systems such as 
the Great Lakes [30]. 

Ecological network analysis has been applied widely to assess 
the impact of species loss on food web structure, stability and 
function (e.g. [31-34]). Several recent studies have applied 
network analysis to investigate the impact of species or groups of 
species, particularly parasites, on food web properties such as 
connectance, link density, and prey:predator ratio [9], [35-37]. 
Woodward and HUdrew [38] apphed network analysis to 
investigate the impacts of an invasive predator on native stream 
food web properties. However, we are aware of few studies that 
apply network analysis to investigate the impacts of a community 
of invasive mammal species on native food web properties (but see 
examples from insect communities in [39], plant-herbivore 
communities in [40], and plant-pollinator communities in [41]). 
Studies of specific introduced species to Newfoundland such as 
American Moose and Red Squirrel have demonstrated significant 
impacts of these herbivores on forest regeneration and structure 
[13], [14]. Our goal is to assess the impact of the full suite of non- 
native terrestrial mammals on the island's terrestrial mammal food 
web. Specifically, our research goals are: 1) assemble the first 
terrestrial mammal food web for the island of Newfoundland, 2) 
assess impacts of non-native mammals on native mammal food 
web properties over time, and 3) determine whether changes to 
food web structure arising from the addition of non-native species 
can be attributed to specific trophic positions. We hypothesized 
that the trophic position (e.g. herbivore, predator) of introduced 
species is the main determinant of its impact on food web 
structure. 



Materials and Methods 

Food web construction 

We consulted the Government of Newfoundland and Labra- 
dor's Department of Conservation and the Environment's list of 
terrestrial mammals of Newfoundland [42] for our list of terrestrial 
mammals on the island. To create a food web describing feeding 
relationships among these species we extracted data from 
published studies that involved diet analyses for mammal species 
on the island. We performed an online search in W eb of Science 
and the Memorial University of Newfoundland online library 
catalogue for peer-reviewed journals, using the keywords "diet" or 
"food habits" in combination with "Newfoundland" and the 
species in question (e.g. "American Black Bear", "Red Fox"). For 
mammal species without diet analyses for Newfoundland, we used 
diet data from other studies mostly from the Canadian boreal 
region (Table 1). We included non-mammal prey items in our 
food web. 

The studies we reviewed used various techniques to infer the 
diet of each species including visual (e.g. [43]) and DNA 
identification [44] of scat contents, stomach-contents analysis 
(e.g. [45]) stable-isotope analysis (e.g. [46]), and quantitative fatty- 
acid-signature analysis (e.g. [47]), as well as various forms of field 
observation (e.g. evidence of browsing on vegetation [48]). The 
measures used in those studies include percent frequency of 
occurrence of various food items within total sample or within a 
specified subcategory of the total sample (e.g. percent frequency of 
occurrence within samples containing bird remains, [49]), percent 
of total volume on a year-round and per-season basis (e.g. total 
percent volume per season, [45]), mean percent prey composition 
(e.g. [50]), mean percent relative density (e.g. [51]), percent of dry 
fecal weight (e.g. [52]), percent contribution to fatty acid signatures 
(e.g. [47]), as well as measures pertaining to field observations, 
such as percent of stems utilized in an area and percent 
composition of browse pile (e.g. [48]). Where available, we 
collected information on sample size, season, and year. From the 
resulting database, we created a matrix that identified all feeding

Non-Native Species Impacts on a Native Food Web 



links among the terrestrial mammal assemblage in Newfoundland. 
The detailed diet and feeding links databases are available on 

figshare [53]. 

The studies we collected showed considerable variability in the 
resolution at which food items and groups of food items were 
presented. For example, Riewe [54] categorized vegetation in Red 
Fox (Vulpes vulpes) diet as grasses, Abies, or berries, whereas 
Bridger [55] simply reported on the single class "vegetation". We 
grouped food items into categories deemed appropriate to 
examine the effects of non-native mammals on native mammal 
feeding interactions, some groups being at a different resolution 
than others. Ultimately these groups were defined based on the 
lowest resolution of each food item for each species. Data on 
mammals are reported at the species level. Data on bird food items 
are reported to the level of Order (members of the Orders 
Anseriformes, Columbiformes, Galliformes, Gruiiformes, Passer- 
iformes), except aquatic birds (a group that contains the Orders 
Charadriiformes, ProceUariiformes, and Pelecaniformes). The 
categors' of aquatic birds is the finest resolution to which we 
could classify these food items. 

Plant food items were designated as grasses, herbaceous plants, 
mosses, lichens, fungi, fruits or deciduous shrubs/trees. Balsam Fir 
(Abies balsamea) was placed in its own category apart from the 
other evergreen shrubs and trees because it is an important dietary 
component for many species in Newfoundland [56-59]. Our 
category' "herbaceous plants" includes freshwater aquatic plants, 
"fruits" includes berries, and "mosses" includes mosses and other 
bryophytes. The food item "terrestrial invertebrates" includes 
insects and "marine mammals" includes only cetaceans and 
pinnipeds. 

The remaining food item groups were marine invertebrates and 
fish. Some diet studies used broad or vague categories (e.g. 
"achlorophyllous plant matter", "birds", "bone", "eggshells", 
"feathers", "flesh", "garbage", "green vegetation", "leaves", 
"miscellaneous vegetation", "nuts/seeds", "plant material", 
"roots", "seeds", and "woodchips"). Oftentimes detailed expla- 
nations of these groups were not included in the studies. We 
incorporated those data in our detailed database but not to 
construct the mammal feeding links matrix. In addition, some 
studies from outside Newfoundland included diet items that are 
not present on the island, or are domestic animals (e.g. lemmings, 
deer, chicken, cow, elk). Again, these data were included in the 
detailed database only. 

Food web analysis 

We calculated species richness (S), total number of links (L), 
connectance (C = L/S), link density (L/S), fraction of basal 
species (i.e. species that do not consume other species), fraction of 
intermediate species (species that consume and are consumed by 
other species), fraction of top species (i.e. species that are not 
consumed), prey:predator ratio (i.e. the number of basal and 
intermediate species divided by the number of predatory and 
intermediate species), vulnerability (i.e. m(^an number of predators 
per prey species; sensu [60]), and generality (i.e. mean number of 
prey per predator species; sensu [60]). We began by computing 
these food web properties for the native terrestrial mammal food 
web only. To assess the influence of non-native species arrivals 
over time, non-native mammals were added to the native 
mammals food web sequentially in the order in which they 
arrived on the island, with non-native species being left in the web 
as more recently introduced species were added. We then 
quantified each food web metric for the addition of every new 
non-native species. 



There is considerable empirical evidence relating non-native 
species functional groups to their ecological impacts (reviewed in 
[10]). Consequentiy, we assessed the effect of different non-native 
functional groups on food web properties by separating native and 
non-native species into three functional groups defined by our 
feeding links matrix. The first functional group, Fj, was 
"Herbivores and insectivores without predators", the second 
functional group, F2, was "Herbivores and insectivores with 
predators", and the third functional group, Fj, was "Predators". 
Tables 1 and 2 outline which native and non-native mammal 
species belong to each functional group. We quantified the effect 
of non-native trophic position on food web properties by first 
removing each native and non-native mammal from the same 
trophic group and calculating the following effect size ratios for 
each metric; [Full weh—Fi ij/Full web,; [Full weh—F2j)/Full web, 
and; (Full weh—F^/iyFull web, where i, j, k are indices 
representing species from functional groups Fi, F2, and F^, 
respectively. For example, the effect of removing American Moose 
(functional group F2j on link density was calculated as fink density 
of the fuU food web minus link density of the food web without 
American Moose divided by the link densit}' of the full food web. 
We calculated the mean effect of removing non-native mammals 
from each functional group, x, on our food web metrics as non- 
native mean ((Full web - FxJ)/Full web)/native mea.n((Full web - 
F^Jj/Full web). This allowed us to tease apart the effect of 
removing a native vs non-native species from the functional group 
on food web properties. Wolves were not included in our analyses 
because most non-native species arrived after the wolf was 
extirpated from Newfoundland and our focus was to investigate 
the impacts of non-native species on the native food web. Also, we 
excluded three transient or vagrant mammals species: Arctic Fox 
(Alopex lagopus), Polar Bear (Ursus rmritimus), and Hoary Bat 
(Lasiurus cinereus) because they are only seasonal visitors to the 
island. Finally, we excluded Bank Vole (Myodes glareolus) and 
American Bison (Bison bison) from our analyses bec:ause they were 
both introduced to offshore islands with the latter introduction not 
being successful. All analyses were conducted with the foodweb 
package [61] in R v 2. 1 5. 1 [62] . Gephi [63] was used to construct 
our food web diagram. 

Results 

The extant native terrestrial mammals of Newfoundland come 
from the orders Camivora (6 species), Rodentia (3 species), 
Chiroptera (2 species), Artiodactyles (1 species), and Lagomorpha 
(1 species). We obtained dietary data on 10 of these species from 
studies conducted on the island of Newfoundland (Table 1). The 
non-native terrestrial mammals of Newfoundland come from the 
orders Rodentia (7 species), Camivora (4 species), Artiodactyles (1 
species), Chiroptera (1 species), and Soricomorpha (1 species). We 
obtained dietary data for 4 of these non-native species from studies 
conducted on the island of Newfoundland (Table 1). The 
remaining non-native mammal diet data came from elsewhere in 
North America (e.g. Ontario, Alaska). The diet data reveals that 
the 1 1 non-native terrestrial mammal species considered in our 
food web analysis (i.e. excluding the 3 transient species) have, on 
average, 5 different resource types (sd = 2.19) whereas the native 
terrestrial mammal species have, on average, 7.08 different 
resources (sd = 5.65). 

The earliest non-native mammal species to colonize Newfound- 
land (Fig. 1) were the House Mouse and Brown Rat which arrived 
with human settlement in the late 15* and early 16* centuries 
(Table 2). The Southern Red-Backed Vole is the last non-native 
mammal species to colonize the island ca. 1998 (Table 2). There

are 30 species (including basal resource categories) in the native 
mammal food web of Newfoundland and 41 species after the 
establishment of 1 1 non-native mammals on the island (Fig. 2). As 
expected, the total number of links and link density in the food 
web increased steadily with the addition of non-native mammals 
over time (Fig. 3). The trend in connectance over time also was 
positive but thi.s trajectory was variable with the addition of some 
non-native mammals leading to a decline in connectance. The 
fraction of intermediate species in the food web increased from 0.4 
to 0.56 with the addition of non-native mammals over time 
(Fig. 3). As more intermediate species colonized the island, the 
fraction of basal and top species in the food web declined from 
0.57 to 0.41 and 0.03 to 0.02, respectively. The prey:predator ratio 
in the food web declined steadily from 2.23 to 1.67 with the 
addition of non-native mammals to the food web. Finally, food 
web vulnerability declined from 4.17 to 3.61 and generality 
increased from 3.1 to 3.61 with the arrival of non-native mammals 
to the island (Fig. 3). 

The removal of non-native herbivores and insectivores without 
predators (i.e. Fj) led to lower (0.96 x) total number of links, 
connectance, link density and generality than the removal of 
native mammals from the same functional group (Fig. 4). There 
was no difference in the fraction of basal, fraction of intermediate, 
fraction of top, prey:predator ratio, and vulnerability to the loss of 
non-native vs native herbivores and insectivores with or without 
predators (Fig. 4). The removal of non-native herbivores and 
insectivores with predators led to a small increase (1.01-1.02 x) in 
the total number of links, connectance, link density, and generality 
than the removal of native mammals from the same functional 
group (Fig. 4). The removal of non-native predators led to an 
increase (1.02-1.05 x) in the total number of links, connectance, 
Unk density, fraction of intermediate, prey:predator ratio, and 



generality, a decrease in the fraction of top (0.33 x) and no change 
in the fraction of basal and vulnerability compared to the removal 
of native predators (Fig. 4). 

Discussion 

The island of Newfoundland has as many non-native terrestrial 
mammals as native terrestrial mammals (Table 1, 2). A few studies 
have investigated the impacts of non-native American Moose, Red 
Squirrel and Snowshoe Hare on the island's flora (e.g. [13], [14]) 
but no studies have investigated the impact of the fuU assemblage 
of non-native terrestrial mammals on Newfoundland's mammal 
food web structure. Our diet and network analysis of terrestrial 
mammals in Newfoundland confirmed our hypothesis that the 
trophic position of non-native species would be the main 
determinant of non-native species impacts on food web structure. 
Specifically, our data show that non-native mammals have 
influenced the island's terrestrial mammal food web primarily by 
increasing the fraction of intermediate (i.e. herbivores and 
insectivores) species, which has led to increasing food web 
connectance and generality (Fig. 3). 

The colonization of 1 1 non-native mammals to Newfoundland 
has resulted in a terrestrial mammal food web with 1.3x the 
number of carnivore species, 2x the number of herbivore and 
insectivore species without predators and 3x the number of 
herbivore and insectivore species with predators compared to the 
native mammal food web (Fig. 2, 3). These changes to food web 
structure has led to greater connectance in the terrestrial mammal 
food web on the island because, on average, herbivores and 
insectivores have more food web links than predators. Recent 
theoretical work based on the analysis of Jacobian matrices 
suggests that an increasing number of prey species per predator

may confer stability to food webs [64]. In Newfoundland, non- 
native species introductions have led to a threefold increase in the 
number of prey species per predator species and there is already 
evidence that a greater prey base has potentially contributed to the 
recovery of a native top predator species on the island. Specifically, 
American Marten were listed as endangered by the Committee on 
the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) in 1996 
but a re-assessment in 2007 resulted in marten being listed in a 
lower risk category': threatened [56]. Introduced Snowshoe Hares 
and Southern Red-Backed Voles may be leading to a more 
diversified diet for marten and contributing to its recovery [65], 
[66]. However, other factors such as reduced mortality due to a 
decline in snaring by-catch and habitat loss also are contributing to 
marten recovery [56]. 

While the introduction of prey species may confer some benefits 
to the terrestrial mammal food web in Newfoundland, it is too 
early to determine the long-term effects of these introductions on 
the native mammal assemblage. For example, abundant non- 
native moose may provide ample carrion to support Coyotes and 
this has the potential to increase predation pressure on the native 
Caribou population. This apparc-nt competition between moose 
and caribou via canid predators has been observed in other boreal 
ecosystems [67], [68]. 

The Coyote is one of the most recent species to establish itself in 
Newfoundland. In most of their range. Coyotes have a diverse diet 
consisting of a number of small- to medium-sized mammals (e.g. 



snowshoe hare, voles) and carrion (e.g. [69], [70]). We suggest that 
the large increase in terrestrial mammal prey and carrion base in 
Newfoundland may have facilitated the successful establishment of 
Coyotes to the island. If this interpretation is true, we may have 
the first evidence of an invasional meltdown (sensu [29]) in 
Newfoundland where positive interactions among non-native 
species could lead to cumulative impacts on native ecosystems 
and the facilitation of additional non-native species colonizations. 
The indirect effects of Coyote predation on native mammals in 
Newfoundland should be a focus of future terrestrial mammal 
studies because this mesopredator has significant impacts on food 
webs in other ecosystems [71], [72]. 

It may seem trivial that prey must be present on an island or 
patch in order for predators to successfully establish themselves 
(naturally or via human introduction). But ecologists have built this 
fundamental trophic interaction constraint into theoretical models 
only recently [73], [74]. For example, in the trophic theory of 
island biogeography, predators can only colonize and persist on 
islands that are already occupied by their main prey species [73]. 
The inclusion of this trophic constraint led to improved 
predictions of real food web community composition compared 
to the classic theory of island biogeography [73]. Extensions of this 
theory to consider multiple preys may help explain the persistence 
of predator populations over large spatial extents. 

The fuU terrestrial mammal food web of Newfoundland with 1 1 
non-native mammals has 1.37x the number of mammals and

addition of non-native species on the island of Newfoundland. The native food web has 30 species and every point after this represents the addition

1.97x the number of links of the native terrestrial mammal food 
web of Newfounciland (Fig. 2, 3). However, the removal of non- 
native herbivores and insectivores wdth predators or non-native 
predators led to an increase in the total number of links, 
connectance, link density and generality compared to the removal 
of native mammals from these trophic groups (Fig. 4). This 
suggests that native mammals from these groups are more 
connected to other species in the food web than non-native 
mammals. For example, the mean number of prey per native 
predator (American Black Bear, American Marten, Canadian 
Lynx, Ermine, North American River Otter, Red Fox) is 11.2 
whereas the mean number of prey per non-native predator 
(Coyote, American Mink) is 6.5. Conversely, the removal of non- 
native herbivores and insectivores without predators led to a 
decline in the total number of links, connectance, link density and 
generality compared to the removal of native species from this 
trophic group (Fig. 4). This suggests that non-native herbivores 
and insectivores without predators were more connected to other 
species in the food web than native mammals from this trophic 



group. Indeed, all three native herbivores and insectivores without 
predators (Arctic Hare, Little Brown Myotis, Northern Myotis) 
only have one prey item each whereas the three non-native 
herbivores and insectivores without predators (Eastern Chipmunk, 
North American Deermouse, House Mouse) have on average 6.33 
prey items each. 

Connectance and link density of species in food webs are 
primary determinants of the robustness of food webs to species 
losses or additions [31], [34], [36], [64], [75]. Species that have 
many links to other species in a food web have a greater potential 
to influence community structure [31]. But recent research 
highlights that the connectivity, trophic level, and traits of species 
removed (or added) will determine the cascading impacts of 
removing (or adding) this species [31], [36], [64]. For example, the 
loss of a prey species in a web with generalist predators and a 
diverse prey base may lead to few secondary extinctions [76]. Our 
study differs from most other food web network analyses in that we 
are concerned with the impacts of species addition instead of 
species loss on food web structure. The additions of species wiU

invariably lead to novel trophic interactions [77-79] and novel 
interactions may lead to complex efFects on food web properties. 
For example, the introduction of the Southern Red-Backed Vole 
may lead to direct competition for resources and space with the 
native Meadow Vole but also indirect competition (i.e. apparent 
competition) among these small mammals (sensu [80]) via shared 
predators (e.g. American Marten). Teasing apart the relative 
strength of direct and indirect competition among species may be 
key for understanding species coexistence [81]. Long-term 
monitoring of populations is rerjuired to understand the impacts 
of novel interactions in the terrestrial mammal food web of 
Newfoundland. 

This research represents one of the few studies to apply network 
analysis to investigate the impacts of non-native species on native 
food web properties. We began by assembling the first terrestrial 
mammal food web for the island of Newfoundland based on a 
review of empirical diet analyses studies. Although likely an 
incomplete representation of the diet of all mammal species in 



Newfoundland (e.g. we did not include non-mammal predators 
such as Falconiformes spp.), our data represent the best knowledge 
of the diet of Newfoundland mammals and forms a good starting 
point for identifying key gaps in diet data. Non-native mammals 
have resulted in a 2..ix increase in the number of herbivorous and 
insectivorous terrestrial mammals in Newfoundland. Through 
network analysis we show that this increase in intermediate species 
has led to the development of a terrestrial mammal food web with 
higher connectance and generality. Future work should consider 
the cumulative effects of global changes such as land-use and 
climate change and species harvesting along with the arrivals of 
non-native species on the structure and functioning of the 
terrestrial mammal food web of Newfoundland [10], [42], [82].
