This bibliography lists works by authors in the 
Native American population. It is made up of fiction and non-fiction 
books drawn from standard reviewing documents and other sources

kinds of materials available from Native American authors. It is not 
meant to represent all titles or all formats which relate to the 
literature by authors of Native American heritage writing in the 
Uni':ed States. Presence of a title in the bibliography does not imply 
a recommendation by the Iowa Department of Education. The non-fiction 
materials are in the orde,: they might appear in a library based on 
the Dewey Decimal Classification systems; the fiction follows. Each 
entry gives author if pertinent, title, publisher if known, and 
annotation. Other information includes designations for fiction or 
easy books; interest level; whether the book is in print; and

PREFACE 



A report by the Population Reference Bureau, Inc. on "America's Minorities - The Demographics 
of Diversity," predicts that half the school population in the United States will be made up of 
ethnic minorities early in the twenty-first century. Already the four largest groups - African 
Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans make up a third of the school-age 
population. It, therefore, seemed appropriate to acknowledge the efforts of authors in this 
population. 

This bibliography of fiction and nonaction books was drawn from standard reviewing documents 
and other sources including on-line sources. It was prepared to give users an idea of the kinds of 
materials available. It is not meant to represent all titles or all formats which relate to the 
literature by authors of nonEuropean heritage writing in the United States in English or whose 
writing has been translated into English. While we have consulted our sources carefully and have 
endeavored to eliminate authors not members of the designated ethnic group, and members of the 
designated group who are from Canada, Mexico, Central and South America or from Africa or Asia, 
we acknowledge the probability of errors in this bibliography and beg the user's pardon in such 
cases. We have also included collections of literature and folklore even if collected by persons not 
members of the designated group when the literature itself was all or partly by ethnic authors 
and if that folklore was developed in what is now the United States or has received major 
modification in that area. Presence of a title in the bibliography does not imply 
advocacy by the Department of Education. 

The bibliography is divided into sections by the four major ethnic groups, African American, 
Asian American, Hispanic American and Native American. Each section is in classed order, that 
is, in the order materials might appear on the shelves of a library. Numbers assigned are from 
the Dewey Decimal system and are approximations of call numbers which might be assigned in a 
library or library media center. Fiction books are labeled with an "F" and Easy books for lower 
elementary and preschool are labeled with an "E". Entries give author where pertinent, title, 
publisher if known, and annotation. Most materials included were in print at the time the 
bibliography was prepared. Those known to be out of print are marked o.p. Publisher's address 
is given when known for companies not included in BOOKS IN PRINT. IL introduces the Interest 
Level when known or estimated. Abbreviations for ethnic groups will be explained in the 
appropriate section. 



NATIVE AMERICAN LITERATURE 



Section Introduction 



The nations of the People known as American Indians, Native Americans or Indians are 
really around 350 separate societies. It is probably not very appropriate to imply that 
there is one Native American Literature, but we hope it is a step in the right direction to 
offer some of the literature of these societies in one document. We have included much 
folklore, and many learning stories and religious stories. We have included folklore 
even if collected by non-ethnic editors. We have not knowingly included stories 
considered too sacred to share but acknowledge the possibility of error. Of especial 
assistance were the AMERICAN INDIAN RESOURCE MANUAL FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES 
(Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, 1992); MULTICULTURAL LITERATURE 
FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS ( Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, 
1991); "Native American Authors Distribution Project," (Greenfield Review Press, 
Fall/Winter 1992); "Cherokee Publications Catalog," "American Indian Authors for 
Young Readers," (Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, 1973); and the 
information available through OCLC. Tribal affiliation is given when known after the 
author or editor's name. Designations for tribal affiliation vary. We generally had to 
accept the information we received which may include different designations or 
spellings. For collections, the designation NA at the end of the bibliographic entry 
indicates that it deals with Native American legends, folklore and other recorded oral 
memories or anthologies of modern and historic literature.
