Acknowledgments 



How do editors adequately express their appreciation to committee 
members who devoted hundreds of hours over a three-year period, for 
no pay, to reading and writing about books? The answer is we can't 
adequately express our thanks, but we can at least acknowledge that 
Chris, Mary-Sue, Luanne, Phyllis, Sally, Judy, Tom, Bonnie, Sue Ellen, 
Peggy, Lois, and Helena did it! As one of them said, "So what else is 
new? That's what English teachers do all the time." And that is true, 
but these teachers and librarians were doing what they do all the time 
plus the work on Your Reading. Admittedly, one committee member 
did take an unpaid leave during the last year of our work, largely to 
help finish up the project. At least our committee is very well read and 
has had frequent intensive experiences with writing for deadlines. 
Thanks from the bottom of our hearts for your professional dedication 
and service! 

Thanks also are due to the publishers who supplied copies of books 
for review and to the NCTE editorial staff. Paul O'Dea, former Director 
of Publications, was unbelievably helpful during the start-up and the 
first year and a half of the committee's work.

Introduction to Readers 



While parents, teachers, and librarians may use this book (and are 
enthusiastically invited to do so), this book is primarily intended for 
students* We selected and wrote about books for you, and we believe 
that you should have a large part in selecting your own reading much 
of the time. You can use this book as you would use tips from people. 
We looked at approximately 6,000 books published in the last five 
years (a few earlier) and selected nearly 2,000 that we believed might 
interest people like you — for pleasure, for school assignments, or 
merely to satisfy curiosity. We have also included a section of reissued 
classics done in extraordinarily high quality editions. All books included 
have, according to committee judgment, some degree of literary merit, 
or they would not have been included at all, but we have singled out 
a select few for special literary merit. The words (Literary merit) signify 
a book of outstanding literary quality. 

The book is divided into sixty-one categories ranging from Abuse to 
Trivia. Within each category, books are arranged alphabetically by the 
author's last name. After the author's name are the title of the book, 
the illustrator's name where appropriate, the name of the publishing 
company, the publication date, and the number of pages. Last comes 
the International Standard Book Number (ISBN), which will aid your 
teacher or librarian in ordering a book from the publisher. A brief 
description is included for each book to introduce you to the main 
theme or main character. A typical entry reads this way: 

Highwater, Jamake. Eyes of Darkness. Lothrop, Lee and 
Shepard Books, 1985. 189 p. ISBN 0-688-41993-3. 

Yesa, a Santee Sioux, is raised by his grandmother during 
the 1800s after his father and two brothers are killed by 
whites. To avoid further exploitation Yesa's tribe leaves 
Minnesota for Canada. There Yesa is educated as a doctor 
by whites, but the slaughter of his people at Wounded 
Knee causes him to reconsider his life's purpose. (Literary 
merit)

Introduction 



At the end of this book are a list of publishers and their order- 
department addresses and two indexes — one arranged by author and 
the other by book title. One way you couid use this book would be to 
start with .a titie or author that interests you. Forgive us if it is not 
there — we had limited space and a four-year time period (1983-87) 
to cover. Also, some publishers did not submit all their books to us. 
Finally, literary merit and appropriateness to young adults in grades 
5-9 had to be considered. 

You could also scan the Contents to see how we have selected main 
topics and theme groupings. Find topics that interest you there. We 
had to choose the one category most appropriate for each book, so we 
suggest that you read through book descriptions in several related 
categories. For example, see Coming of Age, Growing Up Female, and 
Growing Up Male for books about the difficulties of being a teenager. 
When you have found a book that interests you, copy down the 
information and check your school library. If the book is not there, 
ask the librarian to locate the book for you. Librarians love persistent 
readers. 

If you have enjoyed a particular book, sit down and write to the 
author. Be bold. Write your letter to the author in care of the publisher 
at the address listed in the list of publishers at the end )f this book. 
Many publishers and authors consider such a letter an honor, and 
many authors respond personally. Be sure to include your return address. 
If you enclose a stamped, self-addressed envelope, you may be more 
likely to receive a response. 

Remember that reading is an active process. You as a reader are not 
just taking in meaning, you are making meaning as yoa dance with 
the text. You are the one who can make the book come alive, out only 
if you pick it up, open it, and get involved. Make reading a lifelong 
habit. It's not only entertaining, it's the most important part of your 
education.

Pimlott,. John. The Cbld War. Franklin Watts, 1987. 62 p. ISBN 0- 
531-10320-X. 

The cold war is the term used to describe the struggle for power 
and prestige that existed between the Western nations and the 
Communist bloc. This struggle manifested itself after the end of 
World War II and continued until 1962, when U.S. intelligence 
discovered Soviet missile installations in Cuba. U.S. vessels were 
sent to intercept Soviet ships carrying rockets to Cuba, but the 
Soviets decided to halt the shipments. The confrontation dem- 
onstrated that neither side would risk nuclear war, and tensions 
between the two factions decreased. This book traces the history 
of the cold war from 1945 to 1962, examines shifting allegiances 
within each superpower group, and looks at the role played by 
NATO and the Warsaw Pact. Appendixes focus on personalities, 
East-West flashpoints, East-West balance of forces, spies and 
spying, the space race, and a chronology of events. Part of the 
Conflict in the Twentieth Century series.
