The ALANA (Asian, Latin, African, and Native 
American) Mentoring Program was established at Saint Clair County 
Community College, in Port Huron, Michigan, to address the identity 
issues facing ALANA freshmen through peer mentoring. Mentors provide 
social and academic support, support students in thinking critically 
and role playing, and directly assist students with academic choices. 
This paper discusses the target audience, goals, strategies and 
procedures, evaluation, and outcomes of the ALANA mentoring program. 
The first section presents a review of the literature on freshman 
identity and psychosocial development and analyzes the program's 
target audiences. The second section outlines the program's goals and 
objectives. The third section discusses: (1) procedures for 
nominating ALANA mentors; (2) content of the training session for 
ALANA mentors; (3) procedures for conducting bi-weekly group meetings 
between ALANA mentors and freshmen; (4) the college's Contact Calling 
Strategy through which mentors offer advice on such issues as adding 
or dropping courses and tutoring; and (5) the content of the ALANA 
freshman orientation. The fourth section identifies measures that 
will be used to evaluate the mentoring program, while the fifth 
section offers data on mentee retention during the 1992-93 academic 
year and mentee *s evaluations of their mentors. (MAB)

PHASE I 
TARGET AUDIENCE 



In 1988, the American Council on Education reported that by the year 2010 
one-third of the American population will be considered as minorities 
(Jones, 1990). Due to this projected increase in cultural diversity, many 
student affairs officials at colleges and universities nationwide have be^en 
challenged to develop new programs which directly serve the needs of this 
emerging student population. In order to write an innovative intervention 
program however, one must define the parameters of the population they intend to 
serve, identify the special needs and characteristics of that population, and 
assess the environment to determine what conditions for development are needed. 
This paper will serve to examine such issues as they relate to the implementation 
of a proposed ALANA Mentoring Program of freshmen students attending St. Clair 
County Community College. 

When defining the parameters of the target population to be served by the 
Mentoring Program, it is important to juxtapose prevailing observations of 
thought. By doing so, a more precise definition of the target group may be 
articulated. First, the population that the Community College is interested in 
addressing is comprised of ALANA students. ALANA is a term used to describe that 
population of students which meets the ethnic criteria of being of Asian, Latin, 
African or Native American descent. This information is reported under the 
optional information section on the college application for admission. Second, 
all students identified for intervention are first-time freshmen between the ages 
of 17-23 years old. These traditional students may be identified through report 
#ADIS.3.54. 

In reviewing the literature, several theorists and/or researchers such as 
Arthur Chickering, Eric Erikson, M, K. Ho, and James Marcia have identified and 
explained a wide variety of issues concerning college-age students. An appraisal 

3

of their works individually alcng with personal speculation will serve to 
identify the unique characteristics and special needs of the aforementioned 
target group. 

Erikson postulated that "the life cycle can be seen as a sequence of 
'biological-social' phases, or more properly psycho-social" and suggests that"... 
the inherent pattern of human growth and its parallel social climate create a 
universal sequence of psycho-social phases" (Knefelkamp, Parker and Widick, 1978, 
p. 1). It is at his Stage v of human development, that Erikson focuses upon the 
process of identity resolution central to adolescence. Themes highlighted in 
this stage of development are, "...the role of the environment in identity 
formation and the meaning of ego identity" (Knefelkamp, Parker and Widick, 1978, 
p. 4) 

According to Erikson in this transitional life phase, "The individual must 
ask and answer the questions 'Who am I?', 'What will I be?'" (Knefelkamp, Parker, 
Widick, 1978, p. 5). Here, Erikson suggests that adolescence is a time of 
uncertainty. A time where an individual must face identity crisis head-on in a 
directive manner. He explains that, "This phase is dominated by the search for 
personal feedback and perfect solutions. Relationships become most important as 
a source of information and validation" (Knefelkamp, Parker, Widick, 1978, p. 6). 
Because he believed that much of the college experience is spent searching for 
identity, Erikson theorized that Stage V principles are a synonymous 
representation of the freshman experience. 

In order to effectively address the issues of freshmen identity resolution, 
Erikson suggests that the college environment must be facilitative of five 
important elements. The environment should be supportive in the experimentation 
of varied roles, experiencing of choice, opportunity for meaningful achievement. 



freedom from overwhelming anxiety and time for reflection and introspection 
(Knelelkamp, Parker, Widick, 1978). 

Taking Erikson's work one step further, Marcia postulated that there are 
different ego-identity statuses which exist In coping with the identity task. 
These statuses simply represent varying styles of coping (Knefelkamp, Parker, 
Widick, 1978). Marcia identified the four identity statuses as foreclosed, 
identity diffusion, moratorium, and achieved identity. He concluded that, "Ego- 
identity statuses are not stable personality traits; they appear to be a sequence 
of stopping points along the identity resolution path" (Knefelkamp, Parker, 
Widick, 1978, p. 12). From this, he derived that from the freshmen through 
senior year "the most common progression involved movement from 'lower' statuses 
to achieved identity" (Knefelkamp, Parker, Widick, 1978, p. 12). So, first-time 
traditional students entering college, according to this theory, are more likely 
to be categorized under the "foreclosed" stage where no crises have been 
experienced but where social commitments are compounded. 

Finally, Chickering focused specif ically upon the psycho-social development 
of college students. He viewed the triditional-age college student as "a person 
in a distinct psycho-social phase defined by the emergence of certain inner 
capabilities and needs which interact with demands of a particular college 
environment" (Knefelkamp, Parker, Widick, 1978, p. 20). He suggested that along 
the first vector of the continuum the freshman student searches for intellectual, 
physical and social competence. In regard to this, he stated that "Increased 
skills in these spheres lead to a sense of confidence, an inner judgement that 
one is capable of handling and mastering a range of tasks" (-Knefelkamp, Parker, 
Widick; 1978, p. 22). here, the most prevalent question asked by freshmen is. 



"Can I make it here?". If positive interaction occurs in a variety of ways, 
Chickering believes that competency and purpose will be fostered. 

An institutional environment which effectively induces developmental change 
according to Chickering' s theory are those which allow the students to make 
choices, support culturally diverse interaction, provide for varied experiences, 
address issues of critical thinking or problem-solving and facilitate positive 
feedback and self-assessment (Knefelkamp, Parker, Widick, 1978). 

Thus far, this paper has focused upon the psycho-social theories of student 
development. Erikson, Marcia and Chickering have provided an interesting view 
of the issues related to freshmen college students; however, some additional 
observations can be made. Being a student affairs practitioner of a community 
college over the past six years, I have become increasingly aware of the demands 
placed upon freshman students. Many of the students who enroll at St. Clair 
County Community College are students who are working part-time in order to make 
ends meet. A large majority of the freshman class are receiving some form of 
financial aid and are required to do well academically in order to pursue their 
career goals. Continual pressure is placed upon them as they face a dismal job 
market and sky-rocketing tuition at the four-year colleges in Michigan. 

Freshmen students now, more than ever before, are in the unique position 
of having to make mature decisions regarding their futures despite the fact that 
they may not have yet corquered the lower stages of identity resolution. In 
light of this, it is imperative that intervention programs written, to help 
students deal with the apprehensions of attending college, be specifically 
attuned to those strategies which compound a students' commitment to education 
and promote affiliation. The result of such efforts will be seen in increased 
retention.

Thus far, issues of identity resolution have been examined as they relate 
to first-time college students as a whole* However, Ho suggests that a separate 
and specific set of issues relating to the cultural identity of ALANA students 
also exists. Within the next few paragraphs, this paper will reflect upon He's 
adaption of the Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck Model of Value Orientation as it relates 
to the cultural values of selected ethnic groups and those O'^ middle-class white 
America (Jones, 1990). 

The Afro-centric cultural identity has been one of adaptive inferiority to 
white society. With the civil rights movement of the 1960 *s, a positive change 
occurred in the collective cultural identity with "adaptive inferiority" being 
replaced by a greater sense of sexf-pride (Jones, 1990). It is important to note 
that for the purposes of an intervention program geared toward Afro-Americans, 
"A primary source of positive self-concept is family. African-Americans have a 
historical tradition of organizing the family and extended kinship patterns to 
provide support and emotional security to family members" (Jones, 1990, p. 65). 

In looking at the United States Asian or Sinocentric population, a long 
history of racism and discrimination has existed. North American whites believe 
that Asians fit the stereotype of educated and hard-working high-achievers; yet 
Ho states that "Asian success rates are bi-modal," some are successful but some 
are characterized by limited education and low incomes (Jones, 1990, p. 66). 
According to Ho, Asian-Americans have a difficult time of juggling two sets of 
cultural values. He states that, "Asians are much more inclined to value 
conformity to group, interdependence and cooperation"; whereas, American cultural 
norms dictate independence and peer identification (Jones-, 1990, p. 66). The 
ideal intervention program would be one in which an integration of both 
identities are realized.

The Hispanic culture, those whose cultural origins can be traced to Mexico, 
Puerto Rico, Cuba and other Latin American countries, is the fastest growing 
group in the United States toda/. Ho refers to this population in the following 
way, "Millions who are predominantly Spanish-speaking or bilingual . ^ . an ethnic 
group still steeped in its own cultural origin" (Jones, 1990, p 67). He suggests 
that the concepts which are central to the Hispanic cultural identity are family, 
community and religion. 

And finally, over one-half of the Native American population lives in urban 
communities. Native Americans are culturally diverse, according to Ho, and are 
persistent in their struggle against racism. Indians have values with respect 
to their relationship with nature, time orientation and other people 
(Jones, 1990). On a personal note, they are more difficult to distinguish on 
campuses because they blend into the white student population. They are a people 
of extreme privacy and as a result have a very difficult time of adjusting and 
affiliating to the college environment. 

The ALANA Mentoring Program proposed for St. Clair County Community College 
seeks to meet the needs of its culturally diverse population. According to 
Redmond, "Often the psychological climate of a university has a tremendous effect 
on students, especially those from diverse backgrounds. Effective mentoring 
involves not only the transfer of academic skills, attitudes and behaviors but 
a level of interaction, trust and communication which results in a psychosocial 
comfort that empowers a student with the knowledge and confidence to grow 
academically and socially regardless of the environment. If this growth occurs, 
the student will be more likely to remain at the university until graduation, 
thus meeting the need of the university to address the problem of retention" 
(Redmond; 1990, p. 191).

According to Redmond, several reports have shown that planned mentoring can 
be effective in helping under-represented individuals succeed in college and 
university settings (Redmond, 1990). She goes on to say that an "intrusive" 
approach - where aggressive efforts are made to maintain communication and 
student involvement - has br-»n most successful. Additionally, she states that, 
"Effective mentoring requires that people listen to each other, care about each 
other, engage in cooperati,vely and mutually satisfying ventures and manipulate 
systems to meet individual and group needs" (Redmond, 1990, p. 193). 

Ir. order for this intervention program to be implemented effectively 
however, a critical analysis of the environment must be made. Redmond suggested 
that in order to systematically address causes of culturally diverse student 
attrition and delayed graduation, the college must: (1) promote greater student 
contact,. (2) encourage the use of services designed to help students with non- 
academic problems, (3) promptly intervene when students face academic 
difficulties, and (4) create a culturally validating psycho-social atmosphere 
(Redmond, 1990). By creating this type of program, where ti\e college shows that 
diversity is valued on the campus, Redmond believes that retention and 
recruitment of new prospective students will be facilitated. 

In scanning the environment at St. Clair County Community College, it 
appears that many of the student services that Redmond has discussed are already 
present. The College, at this time, supports the needs of those students who are 
experiencing academic difficulty through drop-in tutoring. The Financial Aid 
Office is readily available to assist students with concerns regarding college 
funding. The Counseling Office provides a wide-variety* of support services 
including personal/group counseling as well as academic counseling. The 
Admissions Office supports a MiSIS Walk-off Program designed to contact students

who are consistently absent from classes. And in addition to this, the College 
offers a variety of courses which are specifically designed to address the 
following special topics: study skills, time«management , stress management, 
decision-making, employability skills, career development, assertiveness 
training, speed-reading and more* 

Although the Student Services area is quite comprehensive in its programs, 
there are two environmental factors missing which are vital. First, there is an 
absence of ALANA faculty role-models on the campus. Not one ALANA full-time 
faculty member exists at St. Clair County Community College. So, the need to 
implement a mentoring prograjn which consists of sophomore student mentors is 
paramount. Second, the Community College does not support any special clubs or 
activities which address the needs of ALANA students attending the campus. This 
makes it difficult for ALANA students to affiliate eff ctively with thc;ir peers 
in a non-academic fashion. As a result, the students on the campus as a whole 
are robbed of the opportunity to enhance their cultural understanding of global 
awareness. 

Once the need for intervention has been recognized, the College has a moral 
obligation to act on behalf of all of its students. By incorporating an ALANA 
Mentoring Program for first-time freshman students, the College will become 
proactive with respect to both the needs of a large segment of '*at-risk" 
students, and its own needs to increase student retention. In the following 
phases of this proposed intervention program, goals/strategies, program 
procedures and evaluation instruments will t*. developed and incorporated in order 
to facilitate program implementation.

PHASE II 
GOALS and OBJECTIVES 



GOALS AND OBJECTIVES 



Mission Statement 

St. Clair County CommunitY College will serve as the center for public higher education 
within its defined district, providing a broad range of educational, cultural and social 
opportunities • The College will be driven by the diverse needs of the individuals and 
communities we serve, striving for excellence and programmatic leadership in career 
development, personal and professional development, business and industrial training and 
community enrichment. The College underscores its commitment with an unswerving allegiance 
to creativity, innovation and ths highest standards of quality. 



GOAL 

To effectively address the issues of ALANA freshman identity resolution through peer 
mentoring in an effort to increase social and intellectual competence. 



OBJECTIVES 

1. To provide social and academic support for incoming minority freshmen through 
ALANA peer mentoring. 

2. Support experimentation of varied roles and critical thinking through bi-weekly 
role-playing activities and feedback to be monitored by the mentor. Role-playing 
activities should include both typical and extreme student/student interaction i 
and student/teacher interaction. 

3. Directly assist ALANA freshmen in making choices regarding time-related issues, 
t^ach as, Drop/Add, Tutoring, and Course Withdrawal in an effort to support 
academic success. 

4. Allow ALANA freshmen, at the end of the academic year, to be nominated by faculty 
mentors to fill 1993-94 ALANA Mentor positions. Opportunity to experience 
meaningful achievement will result in providing feedback regarding nomination 
comments which personify individual strengths. 

5. Conduct contact calling by ALANA mentors for the purposes of both minimizing 
anxiety and maximizing social interaction. 

6. Implement a reflection survey to assess the mentor's impact upon enhancing the 
social and intellectual competence of ALANA freshmen. 

7. Facilitate culturally diverse interaction as well as intellectual development 
through an ALANA Fresimian Orientation Program.

ALANA MENTOR 
NOMINATIONS STRATEGY

ERIC 



16 



ALANA KENTOR NOMINATIONS STRATEGY 



Rationale 

Arthur Chickering states that the traditional age college student is in a 
distinct psycho-social development phase (Knefelkamp, Parker, Widick, 
1978). In this phase, according to Chickering, freshmen students are 
searching for intellectual and social competence in order to answer the 
question, "Can I make it here?" (Knefelkamp, Parker, Widick, 1978). 
Additionally, Erickson comments that, "This phase is dominated by the 
search for personal feedback and perfect solutions" (Knefelkamp, Parker, 
Widick, 1978, p. 6). 

Given this, the ALANA Mentor Nominations Strategy is designed to not only 
honor but to provide ALANA freshmen with personal feedback from fac Ity 
members. This is done in an attempt to help minority students solidify a 
positive self-image within the college environment in an effort to 
increase social and intellectual competence. 



Strategy 

Develop a fdculty nominations letter and survey form to be 
distributed to all full-time faculty members in April. 
(Appendix A-2) 

Invite prospective ALANA mentors to meet with the Director of 
Admissions, on an individual basis, to interview for mentorship 
positions. (Appendix A-4) 

During the interview session, the Director of Admissions will share 
personal faculty feedback with the prospective ALANA mentor. This 
will be done to foster a positive self-image in an effort to 
increase social and intellectual competence.

ALANA MENTOR 
TRAINING SESSION STRATEGY 

Procedure and Appendices 



ERIC 



.18 



ALMA TRAINING SESSION STRATEGY 



Rationale 

According to Redmond, "Effective mentoring involves not only the transfer 
of academic skills, attitudes and behaviors but a level of interaction, 
trust and communication which results in a psychosocial comfort that 
empowers a student with the knowledge and confidence to grow academically 
and socially regardless of the environment" (Redmond, 1990, p. 191). She 
goes on to state that, "Effective mentoring requires that people listen to 
each other, care about each other, engage in cooperatively and mutually 
satisfying ventures and manipulate systems to meet individual and group 
needs" (Redmond, 1990, p. 193). 

In response to this, the ALANA Training Session Strategy has been 
established to help ALANA Mentors increase interpersonal communication 
skills and program awareness. By doing so, the ALANA Mentor will be in a 
better position to effectively engage in mutually satisfying interactions 
which facilitate academic and social support for in-coming minority 
freshmen . 

Strategy 

Welcome (8:00 - 8:30 A.M. ) 

The Director of Admissions and the Chairperson of the Minority 
Advisory Committee will officially "Welcome" the ALANA Mentors to 
the Training Session. 

Approximately 15-20 minutes will be spent reviewing the roots of the 
program as shaped by the Minority Advisory Committee. 



Direct Interaction Activity (8:30 - 9:00 A.M.) 

The Director of Admissions will direct mentors to find someone in 
the room whom they do not know. The instructions will be to spend 
15 minutes talking and listening to one-another. At approximately 
8:45 the mentors will be asked to introduce one-another to the group 
based on what they learned during their discussion. 

(Because a great deal of interaction between mentors and ALANA 
freshmen, will occur in one- on-one situations, the focus of this 
activity is to develop listening and communication skills in 
situations which are dyadic in nature.) 



Facilitate Group-Solving Exercise (9:00 - 9:45 A.M.) Appendix B-3 

The goal of this exercise is to explore the effects of collaboration 
and competition in group problem-solving. A second goal is to study 
how task-relevant information is shared within a work group and 
thirdly, to observe group strategies of problem-solving. 



ERIC 



Materials needed for this activity are a set of six Room 703 Basic 
Information Cards for each group. Each card is coded by the number 
of dots (from one to six) following the first sentence on the card. 
Each of the six cards contains different data from the other cards. 
Additional materials include paper and pencil for each participant 
and masking tape. 

The physical setting must be large enough for the groups to work 
without influencing one another. Single group sizes of six or one 
group of seventeen is recommended and the allotted time required for 
the activity is 30-45 minutes. 

The Director of Admissions will act as facilitator and will instruct 
the seventeen mentors to place their chairs in a circle setting. 
Second; a set of Room 703 Basic Information Cards will be 
distributed (one card to each member) . Three minutes will be 
allowed for members to study the information. 

Next; the groups are instructed to begin working. Instructions are 
as follows: You may tell your group what is on the card but do not 
pass it around for others to read. In addition; the facilitator may 
give the following hints: (1) Discover who the educational aides 
are, (2) Di?>cover who the teachers are and (3) Deductive reasoning 
should be applied to the problem. 

Within 20 minutes, when there is agreement within the group that the 
solution has been reached; the group will be instructed to discuss 
how they organized to accomplish the task. 

At the conclusion of the activity, the Director of Admissions will 
present a lecturette on the concept of shared information and 
leadership. In addition^ the idea of effectively communicating in 
order to problem-solve with others will be discussed. 

(This activity specifically addresses the necessity of utilizing 
good communication skills in order to effectively problem-solve. 
Throughout the academic year, mentors will be responsible for 
meeting with their assigned ALANA freshmen, in both group and one- 
on-one situations, where problem-solving may be utilized. Through 
activities such as this, mentors will develop effective strategies 
in working with ALANA freshmen in an attempt to foster academic and 
social growth. ) 



Short Break (9:45 - 10:00 A.M.) 



ERIC 



20 



Discuss Mentor Progrcim Information (10:00 - 11:00 A.M.) 

Distribute ALANA Mentor Folders. Within the folders will be 
information pertaining to: (1) General College Information, (2) 
Mentor Job Description, (3) Code of Ethics, (4) Employment 
Information and (5) Procedural Information/Responsibilities. 

The Director of Admiss. ons will spend approximately one-hour 
reviewing this information with the mentors so that they cognitively 
understand the program philosophy, structure and expected outcomes. 

Direct Goal-Setting Activity (11:00 « 11:45 A.M.) 

This activity is conducted for the purpose of fostering group 
interaction and future program planning. 

The Director of Admissions will ask the mentors to respond to the 
following questions: (1) As freshmen students last year, what did 
you find difficult in adjusting to on the campus? (2) What types of 
activities would you have liked to have seen implemented? (3) How 
do you think we can best meet the needs of in-coming ALANA freshmen? 
(15-20 minutes) 

The group will brainstorm ideas and the Director of Admissions will 
list ideas on a flip chart. 

Once brainstorming has concluded, the group will be asked to develop 
two short-range goals. The Director of Admissions will list goals 
on a flip chart as dictated by the group. (15 minutes) 

Finally, the following 15 minutes will be spent brainstorming 
possible strategies to fulfill the two short-range goals. Again, 
the facilitator will document responses on the flip chart. 

(Chickering proposed that critical thinking and problem-solving was 
one way to foster intellectual and social competence. This activity 
is designed specifically to meet that purpose.) 

Wrap-up (11:45 - Noon) 

The Director of Admissions thanks mentors for attending, collects 
shirt sizes and adjourns.

-WEEKLY ALANA MENTOR/FRESHMEN 
GROUP MEETINGS 

Procedure and Appendices 



2Z 



BI-WEEKLY ALANA MENTOR/FRESHMAN 
Group Meetings 



Rationale 

Erikson and Chickering suggest that in order to effectively address the 
issues of identity resolution, the College environment must provide 
opportunities for experimentation of varied roles and experiences 
(Knefelkamp; Parker, Widick, 1978). Additionally, Redmond suggested that 
the environment must promote greater student contact and create a 
culturally validating psycho-social atmosphere (Redmond, 1990). 

The Bi-weekly ALANA Mentor/Freshman Group Meetings Strategy seeks to 
support the experimentation of varied roles and critical thinking through 
bi-weekly role-playing activities and feedback to be monitored by the 
mentor . This strategy also seeks to promote greater student contact 
thereby validating a culturally psycho-social atmosphere. 



Strategy 

Mentor will establish a mutually agreed upon bi-weekly meeting time 
with "newly" assigned ALANA freshmen students. 

The mentor will support varied role expe:- imentation and feedback 
during bi-weekly group meetings. An example of one exercise to be 
conducted is as follows: 

Not Listening: A Dyadic Role-Play 

(J. Johns and J. Pfeiffer, "Structured Experiences for Human 
Relations Training", Volume III, University Associates CA, 1974). 

The goal of this activity would be to allow participants the 
opportunity to experience the frustration of not being heard and 
will also serve to promote listening readiness. 

The time which is required to conduct this activity is 30 minutes. 
Unlimited numbers of dyads may participate. Materials needed for 
the activity are copies of two roles to be played per dyad and a 
newsprint and felt- tipped marker. 

To begin, the facilitator discusses the goals of the activity. The 
group is asked to form into dyads and the facilitator gives each 
dyad a copy of each role. The dyads then have three minutes to 
study their roles. All dyads should begin the exercise at the same 
time. When the facilitator feels that the group is experiencing 
maximal frustx^ation he/she stops the activity. 

The remaining time is spent listing participant's responses to the 
frustration.

CONTACT CALLING 
STRATEGY 

Procedure and Appendices 



ERIC 



24 



COHTACT CALLING STRATEGY 



Rationale 

Redmond states that in order to systematically address causes of 
culturally diverse student attrition and delayed graduation, the college 
must promptly intervene when students face academic difficulty (Redmond 
1990). 

In response to this, the Contact Calling Strategy has been devised in an 
effort to directly assist ALANA freshmen in making choices regarding time- 
related issues such as Drop/Add; Course Withdrawal and Tutoring. 



Strategy 

Mentors conduct contact calling on a bi-weekly basis as well as one- 
week prior to Mid-term and Final Examinations.

ALANA FRESHMEN 
ORIENTATION STRATEGY 

Procedure and Appendices 



26 



ALANA FRESHMAN ORIENTATION SITIATEGY 



Rationale 

In order to effectively address the issue of freshman identity resolution, 
Erikson suggests that the college environment must be free from 
overwhelming anxiety and must provide time for student reflection and 
introspection. Furthermore, Chickering states that the environment must 
additionally foster opportunities for culturally diverse interaction to 
occur as well as an opportunity for self-assessment (Knefelkamp, Parker, 
Widick, 1978). By providing such opportunities, both theorists believe 
that developmental change will be fostered. 

The focus of the ALANA Fresnman Orientation Strategy is to facilitate 
culturally diverse interaction as well as self-assessment and intellectual 
development. Mentors will be present to compound social relationships in 
addition to fostering student interaction and affiliation. 



Stratecrv 

Check-in (8:45 - 9:00 A.M.) Appendix D-1 

Meet and informally great ALANA freshmen. Distribute orientation 
packets and collect sign-in cards. 

Student Welcome (9:00 - 9:30 A.M.) 

The Director of Admissions and Minority Advisory Committee 
Chairperson will spend 20-30 minutes welcoming students and 
presenting general college information. 

"Let's Concentrate On You" (9:30 - 11:30 A.M.) 

Beryl Rix, Training Consultant will conduct a two-hour presentation 
which focuses upon self -assessment and building self- 
confidence/esteem. 

Beryl will begin her lecture with a short poem entitled, "The Wall" 
by Kathy Peters. Appendix D-1 (10 minutes) 

Inside the orientation folder every ALANA freshman will have a 
"Let's Concentrate On You" packet of materials along with a college 
pen. Appendix D-1 

Beryl Rix will work with the students to identify damaging 
psychological sentences and will go on to have students identify and 
discuss facts about themselves, special talents, strengths and 
future expectations. (1-1/2 hours) 



27 



Once the program has completed, each student will possess a portrait 
of themselves which indicates: (1) Positive traits, (2) Special 
interests/ (3) Experiences, (4) Background, (5) Short-term goals and 
(6) Long-term goals. (20 minutes) 

(Again, the focus of this activity will be to foster self-esteem and 
personal assessment regarding positive and unique traits. It will 
also serve to facilitate group interaction and feedback.) 



ALANA Panel Discussion (11:30 - 12:00 P.M.) 

Five mentors with culturally diverse ethnic status will host a panel 
discussion on "The SC4 College Experience". Fifteen minutes will be 
spent discussing "mentor reflections" while the last 15 minutes will 
focus upon student questions and group interaction. 

(The primary purpose of this activity is to foster culturally 
diverse interaction as well as cognitive information.) 



ALANA Picnic (12:00 - 1:00 P.M.) 

An activity designed to foster affiliation and reduce first school- 
day anxiety.

EVALUATION 



The goal of the ALANA Mentoring Program is to effectively address 
the issues of ALANA freshmen identity resolution through peer mentoring in 
an effort to increase social and intellectual competence. As noted 
earlier, Redmond suggested that if growth occurs, "The studen : will be 
more likely to remain at the university until graduation, thus meeting the 
need of the university to address the problem of retention" (Redmond, 
1990, p. 191). 

In 1990, a Minority Advisory Committee was established at St. Clair 
County Community College to address issues related to low ALANA student 
enrollment. Subsequently, much work has been completed in preparation of 
a proposed ALANA Mentoring Program. Once implemented, the Committee will 
be anxious to review the program's effectiveness with respect to student 
retention. Therefore, the evaluation process of the peer mentoring 
program will be specifically geared toward the collection of statistical 
data related to retention. 

In order to subjectively evaluate whether the ALANA Mentoring 
Program has had a positive impact upon the development of ALANA freshmen 
students, the Admissions Office will conduct a Reflection Survey. The 
purpose of the Survey will be to assess freshmen attitudes and personal 
goals at the end of the 1992-93 academic year. The survey results will be 
used as comparisons to the self-assessment profiles conducted during the 
ALANA Freshman Orientation. 

A second measure used to evaluate the mentors' impact, with respect 
to freshmen development, will be to conduct a mentor evaluation. ALANA 
freshmen, at the conclusion of the 1992-93 academic year, will be asked to 
evaluate their peer mentors on the following criteria: (1) Availability, 
(2) Feedback, (3) Quality of information provided, (4) Approachability , 
(5) Effectiveness in interpersonal communication and (6) Reliability. 

Lastly, statistical data will be compiled to objectively measure the 
ALANA Mentoring Program' s effectiveness with respect to retention. 
Reports will be generated on a semester and yearly basis. Results of such 
reports shall be documented and submitted to the Minority Advisory 
Committee for review.
