ABSTRACT 



In 1996, New York's Westchester Community College undertook 
a study of changes in the demographic characteristics of the college's 
student body, focusing on an increase in enrollment of Hispanic students in 
fall 1996. Data were gathered through the American College Testing Freshman 
Survey administered to 776 first-time students in 46 English composition, 
literature, remedial English, and basic writing classes in fall 1996. Study 
findings included the following: (1) among full-time students, 19.1% reported 

being of Hispanic background, 22.3% reported that English was not their 
native tongue, and 77.2% were under 20 years of age; (2) among part-time 
students, 22.2% reported being of Hispanic background, 30.3% reported that 
English was not their native tongue, and 31.8% were over 30 years of age; (3) 
part-time students had a higher percentage of Black and Asian students than 
full-time students; (4) among students who transferred from another 
institution, 21.6% reported being of Hispanic background, 26.9% reported that 
English was not their native tongue, 41.5% were between the ages of 20 and 
25, and 40.1% were over 25; and (5) it is expected that the increase of 
Hispanic students will require special student services, teaching techniques, 
and courses. (TGI)

1996 Freshmen Students Survey 



Westchester Community College 



For over a decade demographers and planners in Westchester have been speaking about 
the growing population of Hispanic residents in the county. A survey of Fall 1996 
Westchester Community College freshman students shows that Hispanic students have 
finally begun to enroll in significant numbers at the College, too. It also shows some 
important differences between the first-time full-time students, the first-time part-time 
students, and the first-time transfer students. 

It is the purpose of this report to discuss these changes and differences. Since the 
demographic characteristics of the students often drive decisions in responding to student 
needs, knowledge of these changes and differences may very well affect the way we 
administer student services, the methods used to teach these students, and even the 
courses we offer. 

Methodology: This report is based on the 1996 ACT Freshmen Survey conducted on 
776 WCC students enrolled in forty-six, Fall 1.996 English Composition and Literature 1 
classes, Remedial English classes (including ESL courses), and Basic Writing Skills 
classes. The survey includes both day and evening students taking classes both on and off 
campus. This report focuses first on full-time, first-time students. It then turns to part- 
time first-time students and transfer first-time students 

Full-time, Freshman Students 

Ethnic Background A substantially higher percentage of 1996 freshmen full-time* 
students reported being Hispanic than in any previous entering class recorded on the 
college Student Data File. Almost one-fifth or 19. 1% reported an Hispanic background 
with 8.1% from Puerto Rica, 1 .4% Mexican American, and 9.6% other Latino, as shown 
Table I. The African American population reported a slight decline, down from a high of 
16% to 13.0%, while both White/Caucasians (59.7%) and Asian Americans (2.9%) 
continue to decline slightly from previous years. 



* The definition of a first-time, full-time student is any student who is enrolled for the first time 
anywhere in a college degree bearing program and taking 12 credits or more. This includes students 
who took courses in the preceding summer session, but did not begin their academic program until the 
Fall semester.

Native English Speaker Over one-fifth (22.3%) reported that English was not their 
native tongue, as shown in Table II. 

Citizenship Status : A relatively large percentage of students are holding green cards, as 
shown in Table III. Over seventeen percent (17.2%) reported being permanent residents 
with green cards Four-fifths (81.4%) stated they were US citizens, while a very small 
percentage (1.4%) reported having neither a green card nor US citizenship..

Religious Preference For the first time, this survey supplies statistics on the religious 
preferences of our freshmen students and their parents Over half of our full-time 
freshmen students are Roman Catholic (53 6%), as shown in Table IV. Protestants 
comprise 22.9% while Jewish, Islamic, and Buddhist religions each comprise 1.9%. 
Approximately fourteen percent (13 6 %) of the students indicated no religious

Parental Income : For purposes of awarding Section 8 housing allowances, the US 
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) sets the low income level for 
Westchester county at $41,350. It sets the very low income level at $25,850. Almost 
half (49 4%) of the full-time, first time students reported parental incomes under the low 
income level of $41,350, as shown in Table V. Of this low income group, approximately 
half of them fell below the very low income level of $25,000, comprising 23.5% of the 
total students surveyed A large percentage of Westchester Community College students, 
therefore, stand on firm ground in seeking financial aid. At the other end of the 
spectrum, 18.2% of the students reported parental incomes over $75,000 a year, and one- 
third (32.3%) reported an income between $40,000 to $74,999 students. In short, 
approximately half of the full-time freshmen students suiweyed fell below the low income 
level for Westchester county, and the other half, above.

Status of Parents: Over a fourth of the students (28.3%) reported that their parents 
were divorced or separated, while another 1 1.8% reported that one or both were 
deceased, as shown in Table VI. This leaves approximately three-fifths (59.9%) 
reporting that their parents were living together.

Age of Student : Most of the freshmen full-time students beginning in Fall 1996 were 
still in their teens, as shown in Table VII. In fact, over fifty percent (51 9%) reported 
being eighteen years of age and another one-fourth reported being nineteen (25.3%). 
This means that over three-fourths of the freshmen full-time students are under twenty. 
The next highest percentage (8.1%) reported being 20 years old and another 6.7% 
reported being 21 to 24. Only 3.8% of the full-time students reported being over 25!

surprising that most of them (three-fourths or 75. 1%) graduated from high school the 
preceding June, as shown in Table VIII. Another 13.4% graduated in 1995 and 1994.

Miles From College to Home: Getting to college for these students requires either 
having a car or being close to adequate mass transportation. The largest percentage of 
our full-time freshmen (over three-fifths or 62.7%) travel between 1 1 to 50 miles from 
their home to the college, as shown in Table IX. Another fifth (19.0%) travel between 6 
to 10 miles. A few determined students (5.3%) travel over fifty miles!

Part-time Freshmen Students 



Ethnic Background The demographic characteristics of part-time, first-time students 
differ notably from full-time, first-time students. In terms of ethnic background, Blacks 
comprise a far greater percentage of part-time students (one-fourth of 25.4% compared 
to 13.0% full-time). The percentage of Asian Americans is notably higher, too, (9.5% 
compared to 2.9% full-time). Hispanics comprise over a fifth (22.2%) of the part-time 
students which is slightly higher than full-time (19. 1%). It is with the white students that 
the biggest difference occurs. Only two-fifths of the part-time, freshmen students are 
white (41.2%) compared to 59.7% of the full-time students. 

Native English Speaker : A substantially higher percentage of part-time, first-time 
students do not consider English their native tongue. Over thirty percent (30.3%) of the 
part-time, first-time students reported that English was not their native tongue compared 
to 22.3% of the full-time students. This large percentage is attributable to the fact that 
two-fifths (41 .4%) of the part-time males reported English was not their native language. 

Citizenship Status: While four-fifths (814%) of the full-time, freshmen students 
reported being US citizens, this was true for only 73.1% of the part-time students. 
Another 17.2% of the part-time students indicated they had green cards, and almost a 
tenth (9.4%) reported they had neither a green card nor were a US citizen. Only 1 .4% of 
the full-time students reported having neither. 

Religious Preference : A substantial difference exists between the full-time and part-time 
freshmen students in their religious preferences. Only 27.6% of the part-time students 
are Catholic, compared to 53.6% of the full-time freshmen. Over two-fifths of the part- 
time students (41 .2%) are Protestants. Almost a fifth ((19.0%) profess no religion at all.

Parental Income: Only 30 out of a total of 66 part-time respondents answered the 
question on parental income. This may be due to the fact that part-time students are 
older and, therefore, less dependent of their parents. Of the thirty, however, slightly over 
half (53.3%) reported having incomes over $40,000, while another fifth (20.0%) reported 
incomes between $30,000 and $39,000. Close to a fourth (23.4%) reported incomes 
below the HUD very low income level of $25,850. 

Age: Part-time freshmen tend to be older. Almost a third, (31.8%) reported being over 

thirty compared to only 3.8% of the full-time freshmen. On the other hand, only 

9.1 % reported being eighteen years old compared to 51.9% of the full-time freshman. 

Year Graduated from High School : Less than a third (3 1 0%) of the part-time 
freshmen were June, 1996 graduates, while 75. 1% of the full-time freshmen were. 
Conversely, almost a third (29.3%) had graduated from high school in 1993 or earlier. 
Clearly part-time freshmen tend to be those who are returning to school after being away 
for some time. 

Miles from College to Home . Part-time freshmen tend to be located closer to their 
homes than full-time freshmen. Thirty-five percent (35.0%) reported traveling no more 
than ten miles compared to 19.0% of the full-time freshmen, and 63.5% reported 
traveling between 1 1 and 50 miles. Only one student traveled over 50 miles. 



Transfer Students* 



First-time transfer students also differ significantly in demographic characteristics from 
full-time freshmen students and in some cases from part-time freshmen students. 

Ethnic Background : Blacks and Asian American students comprise a slightly higher 
percentage of transfer students than full-time freshmen students. The percentage of 
transfer students reported being Black is 17.7% compared to 13.0% of the full-time 
freshmen students. The percentage of Asian/ American transfer students is (8.5%) 
compared to only 2.9% of full-time freshmen. Moreover, white transfer students 
comprise only one-half of the class (50.3%) compared to 59.7% of the full-time freshmen 
class. Only Hispanic students show little difference between the percentage who are 
transfer students and full-time freshmen students. They comprised 21.6% of the transfers 
in the Fall 1996 class compared to 19. 1% for the full-time freshmen 

Native English Speaker : A higher percentage of transfer students (26.9%) indicate that 
English is not their native tongue than first-time students (22.3%). It is the part-time 
students, however, who report the highest percentage of non-native English speaking 
status (30.3%). 




* The term transfer student refers only to first-time transfer students.

Citizenship Status : A lower percentage of transfers (72.3%) report US. citizenship than 
full-time students (81.4%). Part-time students look very similar to the transfers (73.4%) 
in this regard. What is interesting is the differences in the percentages of students who 
report having neither a green card nor US citizenship. Only 1 .4% of the full-time 
students report having neither, while 9.4% of the part-time students and 6.4% of the 
transfers reported having neither. 

Regions Preference : Half (50.5%) of the transfer students reported being Roman 
Catholic in their religious preference— a percentage not too different from the full-time 
students (53.6%). The contrast occurs with the part-time students, where only 27.6% or 
a little more than one-fourth report their religious preference as being Roman Catholic. 

Parental Income When it comes to parental income, all three categories of first-time 
students-transfers, full-time students, and part-time students-are remarkably similar in 
the percentages who report parental incomes above the HUD low income level 
($41,350). Around one half of the transfer students (49.9%), 53.3% of the part-time 
students, and 50.5% of the full-time students all reported parental incomes above 
$40 000 Conversely, around the same percentage in each category reported incomes 
below the HUD very low income level ($25,350) Thirty percent of the transfer students 
(28.4%) and 30.4% of the full-time students report parental incomes below the very low 
income level A slightly lower percentage of part-time students (23.4%) reported 
incomes below the very low income level. Taken as a class therefore, parental income is 
not a factor that varies substantially among full-time, part-time and transfer students. 

Age of Students : First-time transfer students tend to be older than both full-time 
freshmen and part-time freshmen. Only 18.4% reported being under twenty, in contrast 
to three-fourths (75.0%) of the full-time students and two-fifths (39.4%) of the part-time 
students. Two-fifths (41 .5%) of the transfers are between the ages of twenty and twenty- 
five, while another two-fifths (40. 1%) are over twenty-five. 

Year Graduated From High School : It should come as no surprise than not one of the 
transfer students reported graduating the previous June, 1 996. One-fourth (24.7%), 
however, did graduate in June 1995, having attended another college in the interim. The 
largest percentage of transfers, however, graduated from college more than four years 
ago. One half (50.3%) reported graduating in 1993. or before. Another 8.4% reported 

having a G E. D. 

Miles from College to Home The miles traveled by transfer students to the college 
differ little from those of full-time and part-time students. The large majority (58.6%) 
travel between 1 1 and 50 miles, while a smaller percentage (23.7%) travel between 6 to 
10 miles and an even smaller percentage (12.6%) travel 5 miles or less.

Summary and Conclusion 

Fall 1996 may mark the semester in which Hispanic students became a major component 
of the Westchester Community College student body. The results of this freshmen survey 
show that almost one-fifth (19.1%) of the freshmen full-time students reported being of 
Hispanic background. Over one-fifth (22.3%) reported that English was not their native 
tongue, and 17.2% reported they held a green card and were not US citizens. Over half 
of the full-time freshman (53.5%) reported being Roman Catholic, and only 3.8% were 
over twenty-five. Three-fourths (77.2%), in fact, were under twenty. 

Freshmen part-time students for the Fall 1996 class reported some important differences 
from their full-time classmates. Blacks comprise a greater percentage of part-time 
students (one-fourth 25.4% compared to 13.0% full-time) as do Asian Americans (9.5/o 
compared to 2.9% of the full-time students). The same percentage (17.2%) of full and 
part-time students report they hold green cards, but a larger percentage of part-time 
students (9.4%) indicate they hold neither US citizenship nor a green card. The religious 
preference of part-time students differs, too. Only 27.6% of the part-time students report 
being Catholic compared to 53.6% of the full-time students. Instead, over two-fifths 
(41 .2%) are Protestants. Finally, part-time students tend to be older. Almost one-third, 
(31.8%) reported being over thirty compared to only 3.8% of the full-time freshmen. 

First-time transfer students, look more like first-time full-time students in their 
demographic makeup. While there is a slightly higher percentage of Blacks and Asian 
Americans transfers then among the full-time students, the percentage of Hispanic 
students is similar (21.6 % of the transfers and 19.1% of the full-time students). In fact, 
the highest percentage of Hispanic students appears among the transfer students. Over 
one-fourth of the transfer students (26.9%) indicate English is not their native tongue, 
and 21.3% hold green cards, and are not US citizens. Half of the transfer students 
(50.5%) reported being Roman Catholic. Finally, transfer students are in between full- 
time and part-time students with regard to their age, although they tend to be older. 
Three-fifths (59.9%) reported being under twenty-five and two-fifths (40.1%) over 
twenty-five. 

The succinct conclusion of this report is that the demographic characteristics of the 
freshmen student body as reflected in the survey have changed substantially from those of 
previous years. The change is a considerable percentage increase in Hispanic students. 
With this has come, understandably, an increase in the percentage of non-native English 
speaking students, and non-US citizens. To the extent these students require special 
student services, special teaching techniques, and special courses to compete with the 
other students, the challenge to the College appears to be at hand.
