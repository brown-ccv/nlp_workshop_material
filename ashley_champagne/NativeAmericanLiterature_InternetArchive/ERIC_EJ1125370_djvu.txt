IT IS A COLLISION OF MEOIA, BUT IT IS ALSO A COLLISION OF THE 
POINT OF VIEW ANO CRITICAL LENS THAT NATIVE PEOPLE ANO 
PEOPLE OF COLOR BRING TO OUR ANALYSES OF CHILtREN’S ANO 
YOUNG AOULT LITERATURE. ANO IT IS MAKING A OIFFERENCE. 


S omething unprecedented is hap¬ 
pening in children’s and young 
adult literature. Within the space 
of a year, three different publishers 
recalled books that were criticized 
on social media. Within that same 
period, second printings of several 
other books were revised, and two 
children’s literature review journals 
took action to address the way they 
write reviews. Additionally, writers 
and editors for several journals, as 
well as bloggers at those journals’ 
online sites, wrote about issues 
specific to diversity. 

I see these developments as worlds 
colliding. In short: Native people 
and people of color are using social 
media and content-area blogs to 
review books that misrepresent us. 
This effort is, in essence, more than 
one kind of collision. It is a collision 
of media, but it is also a collision of 
the point of view and critical lens 
that Native people and people of 
color bring to our analyses of chil¬ 
dren’s and young adult literature. 
And it is making a difference. 

Book Recalls and Revisions 

In late August 2016 the University 
of Minnesota Press recalled Sky Blue 
Water: Short Stories for Young Readers 
(edited by Peterson and Morgan 
2016) days before its launch date 
because its foreword included a 
paragraph with the line "Columbus 
discovered America.’’ Shannon 
Gibney, one of the authors who has a 
story in the collection, took a photo 
of the page with that line, put it on 
her Facebook page, and wrote to 
the editors. Within a few days, the 
four thousand copies of the book 


were recalled, and the book will be 
reprinted without that line (Hertzel 
2016). 

On August 4 > 2016, an editor at 
Candlewick sent out an e-mail 
stating that When We Was Fierce would 
not be released as scheduled on 
August 9, 2016 (Barack 2016). 
During the summer months, librar¬ 
ian Edith Campbell and writer 
Jennifer Baker, both of whom are 
African American, had written 
extensive critical analyses of the 
depiction of African American 
youth in When We Was Fierce. Accord¬ 
ing to the e-mail, the book’s 
author, e. E. Charlton-Trujillo, 
and publisher are reflecting on the 
critiques. It is unclear if the book is 
being revised. 

On January 17, 2016, Scholastic 
issued a statement that it was with¬ 
drawing its picture book A Birthday 
Cake for George Washington by Ramin 
Ganeshram. In the weeks prior 
to that decision, Scholastic had 
received a great deal of criticism for 
the book’s whitewashing of the lives 
of the enslaved people in George 
Washington’s home. The book will 
not be revised. 

The next printing of Ashley Hope 
Perez’s Out of Darkness (Carolrhoda 
Lab 2015) will have a small but 
significant revision. Her story, set 
in 1937 in East Texas, is about two 
teens who fall in love. One of them 
is Black. On page 98 of the first 
printing, a character uses "low 
man on the totem pole’’ to refer to 
his status. Although that phrase 
is commonly used that way, it is a 
misrepresentation of totem poles 


and their significance to the Native 
peoples who create them. Given our 
relationship (we worked together on 
an article for Booklist), I wrote to the 
author about the line and asked if 
it might be edited. Perez responded 
immediately, and the line is not 
in the second printing of the book 
(Reese 2016). 

In August 2016 Julie Murphy, 
author of Dumplin’ (HarperCollins 

2015) , wrote that she is revising the 
passage in her book in which she 
used "spirit animal.” This revision, 
she said, is in response to her lack of 
understanding of problems associ¬ 
ated with use of that phrase (Murphy 

2016) . 

In Murphy’s and Perez’s books 
the problematic phrases can easily 
be revised because neither book 
is about Native peoples. As these 
authors realized, the same ideas can 
be communicated without using 
phrases that are microaggressions 
(seemingly innocuous phrases that 
denigrate or demean a person or 
culture of a marginalized com¬ 
munity). 

Review Journals Respond to 
Societal Change 

On May 4 > 2016, Vicky Smith, the 
book review editor at Kirkus Reviews, 
wrote about a recently instituted 
change. Her article "Unmaking 
the White Default” is aptly titled. 
Reviews in Kirkus now identify 
the race of all major characters, 
including white ones. Prior to this, 
the race of major characters was 
mentioned only if they were not 
white. Over the summer of 2016,

offered its reviewers an eight-week 
course designed to increase their 
awareness of issues specific to depic¬ 
tions of marginalized peoples and 
how reviewers can improve their skills 
in describing and reviewing books 
(Miller 2016). 

After several online discussions of 
Lane Smith’s picture book There Is 
a Tribe of Kids (Roaring Brook Press 
2016), School Libray Journal ran a story 
on the differing positions people have 
taken about it (Barack 2016). I had 
seen the cover of Smith’s book, but it 
was Sam Bloom’s £Ol6 review of it at

to take a look at the ways the children

Most librarians use the major

recent developments show, 
their reviewers may not have 
the critical lens to identify 
problematic content. For that 
critical lens, see the resources

suggest it is harmless play, while 
Sam and I argue that the children 
are playing Indian; debates related 
to the picture book occurred on 
multiple online discussion forums. 
In the article Barack (2016) cited 
librarians who felt that, in their 
defense of the book on the Asso¬ 
ciation of Library Service to Chil¬ 
dren (ALSC) online discussion 
list, their "neutral” point of view 
was being attacked. Uncomfortable 
with the discussion, one librarian 
decided not to renew her member¬ 
ship in ALSC and the American 
Library Association. Her decision 
is, of course, unfortunate; however, 
the stories and art in books we 
give to children are not neutral or 
apolitical. If a book’s agenda aligns 
with one’s own, it is seen as neutral 
or the norm. What those who are 
uncomfortable are experiencing 
is a collision in which their worlds 
are being challenged in ways 
they’ve not seen before. 

Librarians’ Perspectives 

In 2015 ALSC revised its "Com¬ 
petencies for Librarians Serving 
Children in Public Libraries” to 
include competencies related to 
diversity. In section I, "Commit¬ 
ment to Client Group,” the first 
two items are about respect for 
diversity and the need to recognize 
"racism, ethnocentrism, classism, 
heterosexism, genderism, ableism, 
and other systems of discrimina¬ 
tion and exclusion,” and to inter¬ 
rupt those systems by providing 
culturally competent services 

(ALSC 2015).

Debbie Reese, a former elementary school teacher and assistant professor in 
American Indian Studies, publishes the blog American Indians in Children’s 
Literature. Tribally enrolled atNambe Pueblo, her book chapters and articles are 
taught in university classrooms in English, education, and library science across the 
Ph t dtDUNh U.S. and Canada. She is frequently invited to deliver keynote lectures and workshops 
at major universities and for tribal associations and organizations. 



The guidelines for some of ALA’s 
award committees were also revised 
in 2015, and, in a meeting with 
committee chairs, Kathleen T. 
Horning (^Olg) recommended that 
committee members recognize their 
personal and experiential limita¬ 
tions and seek out content-area 
blogs like mine (American Indians 
in Children’s Literature), Latinxs 
in Kidlit, and Rich in Color to 
improve their competency in exam¬ 
ining books under consideration 
for ALA awards. See the sidebar for 
resources that provide a critical lens 
for evaluating children’s and young 
adult literature. 

Moving Forward 

All of the developments I’ve 
described are significant. The 
racial and cultural demographics 
of the United States are chang¬ 
ing. It follows, therefore, that the 
content of books will change, too. 
Native children and children of 
color deserve the mirrors that white 
children have had for literally 
hundreds of years (see figure i). I’m 
using social media to create new 
understandings among writers, 
editors, reviewers, teachers, profes¬ 
sors, librarians, and parents. As this 
glimpse into worlds colliding shows, 
others are here to do that, too.
