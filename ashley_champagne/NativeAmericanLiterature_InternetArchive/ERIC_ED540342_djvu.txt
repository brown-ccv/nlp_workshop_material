Executive Summary 

Many colleges and universities assign a book, either to their incoming freshman or 
to the student body at large, as “common reading.” In 2010 the National 
Association of Scholars compiled the most comprehensive report to-date on these 
initiatives. We offer an updated edition for the 2011-2012 academic year. 

Common reading programs are a recent phenomenon; they became popular only in 
the last decade. Their rise seems to correspond to the decline of core curricula in 
higher education — as colleges distance themselves from core curricula they find 
that students still need to have something in common academically. Campus 
common reading programs are a popular answer to that need. The books they 
select are often seen as representative of the colleges’ values, and controversies 
sometimes arise when a college picks a book with a political or ideological slant. 

What books do colleges and universities assign as common reading? What themes 
do the books contain? Are they old books or recent ones? What kinds of colleges 
and universities have common reading programs? What does a typical common 
reading program look like? What does all this tell us about the state of American 
higher education today? 

To find out, we examined books assigned by 245 colleges and universities for the 
academic year 2011-2012. We found that they are, on the whole, recent, personal, 
race-focused, and unchallenging. Our main findings are: 

1. Recent books trump the classics. Almost 90 percent of colleges chose books 
published since January 2000, and all but two selected books published since 
January 1972. 

2. Only two books — one by Mark Twain and one by Aldous Huxley — are 
“classics” even in a broad sense. 

3. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks (2010) by Rebecca Skloot is by far the 
most popular book. 

4. Of the 100 colleges that selected books with a racial or ethnic theme, 60 
chose books that focused on African Americans. 

Among the ways this year differs from last: more colleges assigned books with a 
Native American theme, fewer colleges assigned books about the Islamic World, 
and fewer colleges assigned classics.

Colleges continue to ignore the best books when they make their selections for 
common reading. One likely reason for this is that Americans have eroded the 
distinction between high and low culture. Author Joseph Epstein writes in a recent 
Wall Street Journal book review that this distinction “started to break down once 
the works of contemporary authors began to be taught in universities.” Its 
breakdown progressed with the rise of multiculturalism and the study of popular 
culture. 

We encourage colleges to continue and to improve their common reading 
programs. We offer 1 1 recommendations to colleges for choosing better books and 
making the most of the common reading experience. We also offer a list of books 
we recommend for common reading.

Controversies 

Common readings often spark controversy, and this year was no exception. In 
August 2010, Brooklyn College announced its selection: How Does It Feel to Be a 
Problem? Being Young and Arab in America, by Moustafa Bayoumi, a Brooklyn 
College professor of post-colonial literature and a disciple of Edward Said. The 
book aims to establish Arab and Muslim Americans as victims and indict 
American society for making them so. Controversy arose when several concerned 
academics each challenged the College’s decision to select this particular book. 

A professor at the University of British Columbia wrote to the Brooklyn College 
president, “While much of it is interesting and informative, the ‘afterword’ is a 
harshly- worded polemic against US foreign policy and against Israel. To believe 
the author, the problems of Brooklyn Arabs arise from U.S. imperialism.” A 
Brooklyn College professor wrote, “It smacks of indoctrination.” 1 And one 
alumnus actually wrote the College out of his will 2 after learning of the book 
assignment. 

(Brooklyn College picked a different book for 201 1-2012, but the University of 
North Carolina-Charlotte was undeterred by the controversy and selected How 
Does It Feel to Be a Problem? this year.) 

Then in April 201 1, 60 Minutes ran an expose on Greg Mortenson, whose books 
Three Cups of Tea (a New York Times bestseller) and Stones Into Schools , have 
been popular as common reading assignments. The program provided compelling 
evidence in support of allegations that Mortenson fabricated or exaggerated key 
points in his books. The 60 Minutes segment put some colleges that had intended 
to honor Mortenson and have him speak on campus in an awkward position. This 
year not one college selected a book by Mortenson as common reading. 

Common reading programs are extra-curricular and may seem peripheral to 
campus academic life, but the choice of a single book for this purpose is often (and 
probably rightly) understood as emblematic of a college’s values. Critics “read” 
the selections as indicating what a college truly considers important.

This may not be a fair view; colleges and universities do not necessarily embrace 
the views expressed in the books they assign, and some institutions choose 
controversial books in order to promote healthy debate. Other times, however, 
colleges do select books specifically because they contain views they believe 
students should adopt. In any case, it’s worth taking note of the books colleges 
select for common reading programs and considering what these trends tell us 
about contemporary American higher education. 


Methods 

This is intended to be a comprehensive inventory, and we have included all 
common reading programs for which we could find up-to-date information. 

We used the 2010 list, which we compiled from others’ previous lists and our own 
online research, as the starting point for the 2011 list. Eighty-two of the colleges in 
last year’s study discontinued their common reading programs or failed to update 
their websites and could not be reached by email or phone for information on this 
year’s selection. 3 

We also found new programs that we did not know about last year and added them 
to our updated edition. We invite other colleges and universities we may have 
missed to inform us of the books they have selected and send their contact 
information so that we can include them next year. 

Our 2011-2012 list covers 245 colleges and universities, 148 books, and 137 
authors. We have listed the programs in several ways: 

1 . Alphabetically by book author 

2. Alphabetically by institution 

3. By institution type: public (127), community (28), non-sectarian private 
(70), and sectarian (20) 4 

4. By institutions listed by U.S. News & World Report in the top 100 of its 
National Universities list (42) and its Liberal Arts Colleges list (18) 


3 A list of programs that were included in the 2010 Beach Books report but have since been discontinued is available 
at http://www.nas.org/userfiles/file/Colleges%20Without%20201 l%20Common%20Reading%201.xls . 

4 We also noted here that one historically black university (Lincoln University) and five women’s colleges (Mount 
Holyoke College, Peace College, Smith College, Sweet Briar College, and Cedar Crest College) have common 
reading programs.

To see the lists organized these four ways, click on the tabs at the bottom of 
the spreadsheet labeled “By Author,” “By Institution,” “By Institution Type,” 
and “Nationally Ranked.” 

For each listing we have included the name of the common reading program and a 
link to the page on the college’s website that tells about the program. 

After gathering the data, we collected information about the books. We have 
provided the year in which the book was published and we have identified which 
books are written as memoirs, biographies, fiction, histories, and plays. See “Book 
Genres” below (page 8). We looked for recurring motifs among the books selected 
and classified all of them according to categories. See “Book Categories” below 
(page 8). We also identified emphases on particular racial and ethnic groups and 
emphases on Hurricane Katrina. See “Book Themes” below (page 16). 


The Mechanics of Common Reading Programs 

As we noted last year, college common reading programs, a relatively new 
phenomenon, are a sort of proxy for core curricula, which are now all but extinct at 
most institutions. Without an ordered, sequential curriculum shared by the student 
body, colleges have felt the need to give students something academic “in 
common.” Otherwise, students have only the corporal aspects of campus life in 
common: freshman orientation, sports, cafeterias, geographic location, etc. 

Reading the same book gives them something to talk about by way of ideas. 

Colleges’ have various names for their common reading programs; this year’s set 
includes One Book, Writer as Witness Colloquium, iRead, and Interregnum. Often 
the readings are part of a yearlong theme chosen by the college. Where these 
themes were readily apparent, we noted them in the column “Theme.” Here is a 
sampling of the themes we observed: 

• Public Health: Promoting Wellness for Self and Community (Bluffton 
University) 

. The Year of China (Brown University) 

. Living on the Borders: Migration, Identity and Survival (Chandler-Gilbert 
Community College) 

. Civility (Hiram College) 

. Ways of Knowing (James Madison University) 


6 



Beach Books 2011-2012 
National Association of Scholars 


. Righting Civil Wrongs (Lafayette College) 

. The Pursuit of Innovation (The College of New Jersey) 

. Creating and Living in a Sustainable World (University of Arkansas) 

The departments in charge of common reading programs also vary. Usually the 
sponsor is either the college’s new student program, the library, or the English 
department. Often a committee determines each year’s selection by vote, student 
consensus, or pre-established criteria. For example, Brooklyn College’s dean has 
said that the College typically chooses “memoirs (a genre familiar to students) set 
in New York City, often reflecting an immigrant experience, and written by 
authors who are available to visit campus.” Southern New Hampshire University 
selected Water for Elephants this year simply “because of its high interest and its 
potential for satisfying discussion.” 

Sometimes the assignment is accompanied by an essay prompt or comprehension 
test, but often the reading is optional and the book selection is superficial - it 
doesn’t matter as much that students actually read the book as it is that the campus 
puts out press releases announcing its choice and a scheduled speech by the author. 
Indeed, the availability of the author for a campus visit appears to have become a 
major factor for most colleges in making their choices. 

That may contribute to the extraordinarily low number of selections (two) 
published before 1972. 

Hot Off the Press: Book Publication Dates 

Colleges seek recently published books for common reading programs because: 

. They hope to invite the author to speak on campus. 

. They assume current books are more accessible to students. 

• They believe students will be more enthusiastic about contemporary themes. 
. They want the college itself to be identified with fashionable ideas. 

• They hope to pick up on the momentum of a book that is popular with the 
general public, and trust that more students will actually read it. 

. A movie version may be available or due soon. 

219 out of 245 colleges (89 percent) chose books published in the year 2000 or 
later. Only two chose books published before 1972: Metropolitan Community 
College in Omaha, Nebraska with Brave New World (1932) and The King’s

College in New York, New York with A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s 
Court (1889). The most widely assigned book, The Immortal Life of Henrietta 
Lacks, was published in 2010. 


Book Genres 

Seventy-nine colleges and universities assigned memoirs, 62 assigned biographies, 
48 assigned fiction, 4 assigned histories, and 1 assigned a play. Ten assigned 
graphic novels (comic books). The number that assigned biographies may be 
artificially inflated by the popularity of Henrietta Lacks. Of the 62 biography- 
assigning schools, 39 chose Henrietta Lacks. The memoir genre comprises by far 
the greatest variety of books selected for common reading programs: 1 1 different 
biographies and 42 different memoirs were selected. 

Why memoirs? As the Brooklyn College dean said, memoirs are “a genre familiar 
to students.” In high school English courses, students are taught to base their 
interpretation of works of literature on their own personal experiences. A recent 
study on high school literary study finds that this emphasis on the personal “may 
be contributing to the high remediation rates in post-secondary English and reading 
courses.” 5 

Training students to write from the perspective of personal reflection gives them a 
taste for more of the same. This is one explanation for the popularity of the memoir 
in common reading programs. 

Another is that our society has an appetite for true stories. The growing number of 
reality TV shows is evidence of this. Getting to hear from the author in person at a 
scheduled campus speech is part of the allure of the memoir. 

The emphasis on memoir may also reflect the rise of post-modern sensibilities in 
American higher education. A memoir often presents “my truth,” rather than “the 
truth.” It is a way of asserting the primacy of self and the importance of opinion as 
trumping common judgment, authority, and hard- won facts.

As we collected book titles for this year’s set, we observed some trends emerging 
in terms of genre and topic. We designated categories for the books according to 
these trends. Below is a list of the categories we identified and the distribution of 
books in each. As can be seen, the top three motifs of books selected by colleges 
for common reading programs were “Historical Depictions of American Society” 
(with The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks comprising the bulk of this category), 
“Multiculturalism/Immigration/Racism,” and “Environmentalism/ Animal 
Rights/Food.” In 2010, the two latter categories were the most prominent.

These categories are provisional. We made our best judgment of where to place 
each book, usually based on what we could find out about the book from 
publisher’s blurbs and reviews — it being impossible for us to read all 148 books. 
Many of the books clearly have more than one theme and, since we are listing each 
book only once, we had to choose which among its several themes was most 
salient. For example, The Pact is a memoir about three young men from inner city 
Newark who, while attending a magnet school, make a pact to attend and complete 
college. We could have classified this as “Self-Help/Pursuit of Happiness,” 
“Coming of Age,” or even “Forgiveness/Redemption.” But we chose to put The 
Pact in our “Poverty” category because the most prominent theme in the book is

overcoming the conditions of the impoverished neighborhoods in which they grew 
up. 

Only a few of our categorization choices were as many-branched as this one, but 
books are by their nature many-sided. Our aim is to offer a broad overview of the 
kinds of books colleges are assigning, not to pigeonhole individual books.

Book Themes 

We observed that many books — even those not focused on multiculturalism — paid 
particular attention to various racial and ethnic groups. These we noted with a 
symbol, as seen in the chart below. 


A Indicates an African American theme 

60 

ft Indicates an African theme 

18 

♦ Indicates Native American theme 

10 

* Indicates a Latino theme 

7 

3€ Indicates an East Asian theme 

5 


Books with an African American theme far outnumbered those with other racial 
and ethnic themes. Of the 100 colleges that selected books with a racial or ethnic 
theme, 60 chose books that focused on African Americans. 

We also kept track of three other trends: books for which a movie version exists or 
is in production, comic books/graphic novels, and books with a Hurricane Katrina 
theme. 


□ Indicates that a film version exists or is in production 

64 

HK Indicates Hurricane Katrina theme

t Indicates comic book or graphic novel

What’s Different This Year 

Comparing this year’s set of books with 2010’s, we noticed a number of changes. 

• The book generally seen as the quintessential common reading text, Barbara 
Ehrenreich’s indictment of capitalism Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By 
in America, has finally retired. 

. Thanks to the 60 Minutes expose alleging false and fabricated information in 
them, books by Greg Mortenson, including the formerly popular Three Cups of 
Tea, are now being shunned. Last year it was the third most widely assigned 
book. 


16 




Beach Books 2011-2012 
National Association of Scholars 


. Books that focus on the Islamic world are no longer popular choices for 
common reading. The loss of Greg Mortenson’s books and the controversy at 
Brooklyn College over How Does It Feel to Be a Problem ? may have 
contributed to this decline. 

. Only two “classics” have been selected: Brave New World and A Connecticut 
Yankee in King Arthur’s Court. These are also the only two common reading 
books published before 1972. Last year, by contrast, colleges selected 
Frankenstein , Walden, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, The Communist 
Manifesto, The Grapes of Wrath, and Crime and Punishment', two of these were 
chosen by more than one college. We use the word “classic” in this context 
with some hesitation. See “Missing Classics” below (page 19). 

. More books with a Native American theme have been chosen. The Native 
American author Sherman Alexie is particularly popular this year; colleges 
have selected three of his books for common reading. 

. Books with an African American theme are hugely popular. This theme is 
bolstered, not only by The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, but also by books 
about overcoming obstacles to success presented by life in the inner city, such 
as The Other Wes Moore: One Name, Two Fates, Make the Impossible 
Possible, A Hope in the Unseen, and The Pact. 

• Memoirs are the dominant genre. One possible reason for this is that high 
schools teach writing from the perspective of personal experiences, and many 
universities like to stick to a genre familiar to new students. See “Book Genres” 
above (page 8). 


Henrietta Lacks 


The top choice for college common reading programs can tell us 
a few things about colleges’ current values. This year, one book 
not only topped the list but did so by a huge margin. Thirty-nine 
colleges and universities selected The Immortal Life of Henrietta 
Lacks (2010) by Rebecca Skloot. The next most popular books, 
Dave Eggers’ Zeitoun (2009) and the two-volume anthology This 
I Believe (2007, 2008) - which was last year’s top choice - didn’t 



17 


Beach Books 2011-2012 
National Association of Scholars 


even come close. They were each selected by only nine colleges and universities. 

When we recognized the dominance of this book in college common reading 
programs, we decided to read it in its 328-page entirety. It chronicles the story of a 
person whose cells were the first to survive in culture so that scientists could test 
their behavior. The cell line, named HeLa, came from a sample of cervical cancer 
in an African American woman named Henrietta Lacks, who died from the cancer 
in 1 95 1 . HeLa revolutionized medical research and resulted in thousands of the 
vaccines and medicines we take for granted today. Oprah Winfrey will produce an 
HBO film version of the book. 

The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks raises a number of questions, such as 
whether it was ethical for doctors to have taken the cell sample without Henrietta’s 
informed consent, whether anyone should have profited from their sale, whether 
the Lacks family should have been given a share of the profits, whether doctors, 
scientists, and journalists took advantage of the Lacks family because of their race, 
and whether Henrietta the person was nearly forgotten. 

At one point, Deborah Lacks, Henrietta’s daughter, said she rejected the racism 
narrative that others pushed on her: 

“Everybody always yellin, ‘Racism! Racism! That white man stole that 
black woman’s cells! That white man killed that black woman! ’ That’s crazy 
talk,” she told me. “We all black and white and everything else — this isn’t a 
race thing. There’s two sides to the story, and that’s what we want to bring 
out. Nothing about my mother is truth if it’s about wantin to fry the 
researchers. It’s not about punish the doctors or slander the hospital. I don’t 
want that.” 

But Deborah later wrote this poem: 

cancer 

check up 

can ’t afford 

white and rich get it 

my mother was black 

black poor people don ’t have the money to pay for it 
mad yes I am mad 

we were used by taking our blood and lied to

We had to pay for our own medical, can you relieve [sic] that. 

John Hopkin Hospital and all other places, that has my mother cells, don ’t 
give her 
Nothing. 

A major question in the book is Do people have rights over their former body 
parts? Skloot explains that hospitals usually don’t throw away tissues, organs, and 
body parts removed from patients in medical procedures, but keep them for 
research. A relatively new “tissue rights” movement has begun by those who 
believe that people should have either property rights to — or at least a say in the 
use of — anything removed from their bodies. A counter-argument is that once 
something has been removed, it no longer belongs to the patient whose body it was 
taken from. 

This is an interesting if rather odd debate. It may become part of a real policy 
debate in years to come; at the moment it has a degree of artificiality: something 
that the book has stirred up rather than something that was already in the air. 

The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks can thus be taken in two ways: 

A. As introducing a scientific breakthrough that after the fact gave rise to a 
social controversy. 

B. An effort to create a social controversy on the basis of a long-since settled 
scientific accomplishment. 

The book does make a history of complex scientific research accessible to average 
readers, and Skloot explains biological jargon in simple terms. Readers will come 
away from the book having learned new things, but the writing itself is journalistic, 
not intellectual. 

Judging by what they say about it, some colleges seem to have chosen The 
Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks in part because it can be read as a story of racial 
injustice. Skloot herself is coy about this. The book has numerous allusions to the 
theme but Skloot never expresses it overtly. North Carolina State University says 
on its website that it chose Henrietta Lacks because it “touches on a number of 
academic and personal issues, including ethics, economics, racism, community, 
science, research, politics, education and History .” 6 Adelphi University notes that

“Her story is at times uncomfortable and forces the reader to confront many issues: 
bioethics, science, racism, poverty, faith and more.” 7 

Southern Methodist University has on its website a list of reasons to persuade 
students to read the book: 8 

Why Should You Care? 

THE TOP TEN REASONS 

1 . Law & Order used it for the basis of an episode. 

2. Her story shaped the ethical process for Medical Experimentation & 
Informed Consent. Now doctors must follow strict legal and ethical 
guidelines. 

3. HeLa cells were the first ever cloned and help developed the Polio vaccine. 

4. We use HeLa cells in our research on the SMU campus! 

5. More than 60 critics named The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks as one of 
the Best Books of 2010, and over 30 colleges have selected it for its [sic] 
Common Reading. 

6. Her cells were commercialized and have generated millions of dollars in 
profit for the medical researchers who patented her tissue. 

7. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is being adapted into an HBO 
film produced by Oprah Winfrey and Alan Ball. 

8. In 1960 Henrietta’s cells went up in the second satellite ever in orbit! 

9. If all the HeLa cells that have been produced were weighed, they would add 
up to 50 million metric tones and if laid out, they would wrap around the 
earth three times, [sic] 

10. According to Wired, HeLa Cells are the most popularly used cell lines for 
research. 


Missing Classics 

Out of 245 colleges and universities, only two selected books that could loosely be 
termed “classics.” These are Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World (1932) and Mark 
Twain’s A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court. The former is more of a 
classic than the latter, which earns the status primarily for its author’s reputation, 
not its own. The two books are also the only two on this list published before 1972.

Last year, by contrast, 9 colleges selected books that could be deemed classics. 
What accounts for the decline in our colleges’ already languishing engagement 
with great — or even important — books? 

Let’s note first that the world of books that are tacitly excluded from common 
reading is very large. Nothing from classical antiquity; nothing from the 
Renaissance; nothing from the great age of English essays or the rise of the modem 
novel; and nothing that would in even a mildly restrictive use of the term be 
considered a tme classic makes the list. When we raised some concern about this 
last year, we received some responses along the lines that all those sorts of books 
are to be found in the regular curriculum so that there is no need to select among 
them for common readings. This argument looks shaky. There may be colleges that 
have general education requirements that include books of enduring philosophy, 
history, or literature. Apart from the few “great books” programs, such as St. 
John’s, these are difficult to find. (NAS is planning a separate investigation of 
this.) 

So there is something here that needs to be explained: why is American higher 
education paying so little attention to common readings of books traditionally held 
in high esteem among educated people? 

Perhaps the problem is that colleges are simply being practical. Classic books are 
more challenging than non-classics, and they require the reader to insert himself 
into a different era than his own. Both these qualities pose problems for many 
contemporary American college students. A journalist inquiring at NAS about this 
study asked, “Where is the balance between high standards and realism?” 

While it is better for college students to read something rather than nothing, 
realism doesn’t have to mean catering to students’ comfort zones. It should be 
realistic to expect students who aspire to a college education to read challenging 
books. As it says on the Southern Methodist University website, “To come to 
college means to come into a new relationship with books.” 

If colleges are admitting students who dislike reading or are incapable of reading 
moderately challenging books, this is a fundamental disconnect between the 
purpose of higher education and colleges’ actual behavior. But colleges have a 
good opportunity to remedy the problem using common reading programs - to 
introduce students to college-level reading and instill in them a taste for time-tested 
books. Unfortunately for most, it is a missed opportunity.

Literature’s Fall 

Some books are better than others. One reason colleges and universities have 
drifted away from the best books is precisely because they deny those books’ 
superiority. Joseph Epstein, former editor of The American Scholar and author of 
many essay collections and books, chronicles literature’s decline in his August 27, 
2011 book review of a new anthology, The Cambridge History of the American 
Novel? Epstein faults the book for promoting a stiff view of literature in which 
race, class, and gender are always the leading themes and America is a cruel 
empire full of bigots. He writes that this view asserted itself only “after the death 
of the once-crucial distinction between high and low culture, a distinction that, 
until 40 or so years ago, dominated the criticism of literature and all the other arts.” 
Epstein explains: 

Under the rule of this distinction, critics felt it their job to close the gates on 
inferior artistic products. The distinction started to break down once the 
works of contemporary authors began to be taught in universities. 

The study of popular culture — courses in movies, science fiction, detective 
fiction, works at first thought less worthy of study in themselves than for 
what they said about the life of their times — made the next incursion against 
the exclusivity of high culture. Multiculturalism, which assigned an 
equivalence of value to the works of all cultures, irrespective of the quality 
of those works, finished off the distinction between high and low culture, a 
distinction whose linchpin was seriousness. 

In today's university, no one is any longer in a position to say which books 
are or aren't fit to teach; no one any longer has the authority to decide what 
is the best in American writing.

Epstein observes that the number of students choosing to major in English is 
rapidly declining. He quotes English professor William Chace on this point, who 
wrote in a 2009 article 10 : 

What are the causes for this decline? There are several, but at the root is the 
failure of departments of English across the country to champion, with 
passion, the books they teach and to make a strong case to undergraduates 
that the knowledge of those books and the tradition in which they exist is a 
human good in and of itself. What departments have done instead is 
dismember the curriculum, drift away from the notion that historical 
chronology is important, and substitute for the books themselves a scattered 
array of secondary considerations (identity studies, abstruse theory, 
sexuality, film and popular culture). In so doing, they have distanced 
themselves from the young people interested in good books. 

Most college common reading programs repeat English departments’ mistakes: 
they fail to distinguish between high and low culture; they pay service to 
multiculturalism, relativism, popular culture, and the primacy of self; they extol 
books that are critical of America and the West; and they alienate students who can 
appreciate really good books. 

In so doing, colleges exacerbate some of the key problems that plague both higher 
education and American society at large: 

1. An inability to distinguish “the truth” from “my truth” 

2. A tendency to ignore aspects of the world that fall outside the bounds of 
race, class, and gender 

3. A shallow understanding of the human heart 

4. A lack of humility and willingness to learn 

5. A sense of resentment toward those who are prosperous 

Colleges should, in principle, distinguish among excellent books, good ones, the 
merely mediocre, and dross. And, in the limited time that colleges have the chance 
to influence students, they should try to form their taste for the better.

Reverse It." The American Scholar. 22 Sept. 2009. http://theamericanscholar.org/the-decline-of-the-english-

Recommendations 

We applaud colleges and universities that assign a single book to freshmen or the 
whole student body as a common reading experience. This is an initiative that 
should continue, but should also improve if it is to be effective in raising students’ 
sights to what is really “higher” in their higher education. 

In 2010, the National Association of Scholars offered a list of books we 
recommend for college common reading programs. See Appendix G: 
Recommended Books for College Common Reading (page 77) for the full list and 
the reasons we picked each one. We recommended 37 books appropriate for any 
college common book program, and six choices that are more ambitious either 
because of length or intrinsic difficulty. 

We regret that no college accepted our invitation to use this resource. None of the 
books we recommended was actually chosen. Nevertheless we again invite 
colleges to draw on our suggestions. 

In addition to recommending specific books, we have some additional general 
recommendations for common reading programs. 

To choose better books, we recommend that colleges: 

1 . Choose books that challenge students intellectually. 

2. Pay deliberate attention to important books from earlier eras. 

3. Choose the chooser(s) wisely. Consult those who read widely and well 
and who are intimately acquainted with good books. 

4. Consult outside sources, such as the National Association of Scholars’ 
list (See Appendix G: Recommended Books for College Common 
Reading, page 77) or the National Endowment for the Arts program The 
Big Read. 

5. Ask alumni, “Which book that you read in college influenced you the 
most?” and consider their answers as candidates for common reading. 

6. Break bad habits. Choosing books that cheerlead for popular causes or 
reinforce a political sensibility is a bad habit. 

7. Mix it up. Alienation and oppression are important themes but so are 
courage, fidelity, redemption, self-sacrifice, fellowship, and truth, among 
others. 


24 



Beach Books 2011-2012 
National Association of Scholars 

To make the most of the common reading experience, we recommend that 
colleges: 

8. Make reading the book mandatory, and enforce the assignment with a 
test. 

9. Require that students submit a list of new words they learn from the 
book. 

10. Stage dramatic readings of the book by professors who can do voices. 

1 1 . Bring in an impersonator or an expert on the writings of a deceased 
author to speak and answer questions.

Appendix G: Recommended Books for College Common Reading 

Our considerations in compiling this list: 

1. We sought diversity — the intellectual kind. 

2. We sought books that are neither too long nor too short. “Too long” means a 
book that would defeat even the able, well-intentioned, and determined pre- 
freshman reader. No War and Peace here. In a few cases we’ve recommended long 
books but specified that the college should assign selections. “Too short” means a 
book or essay that would invite the pre-freshman to treat the assignment as a 
triviality, even though it isn’t. No Kennedy’s “Ask not” inaugural address. 

3. We sought texts that are just a bit over students’ heads, but not so far that they 
are beyond reach. We excluded many works of classical antiquity on this 
basis. Sophocles is best read with the guidance of an instructor. Nietzsche invites 
wild misreadings from those who lack the philosophical context. 

4. We sought works that are not contemptuous of humanity or dyed in profound 
cynicism. Some such books belong in the college curriculum but we judge them a 
poor welcome mat to the pre-freshmen who ought to have a somewhat more 
positive introduction to why colleges exist and why they are devoting time and 
money to the enterprise. No Samuel Beckett or H. L. Mencken here. 

5. In fiction, we sought works that exemplify elegance of language and a degree of 
complexity, along with moral seriousness. 

6. In non-fiction we looked for works that exemplify important ideas, lucidly 
argued, and writers who take their rhetorical task seriously. 

7. We sought to accommodate colleges that approach common reading 
assignments at different levels of difficulty. To that end, we divide our list into two 
parts. Part A is a list of 37 books all of which are appropriate in level of difficulty 
and length to any college freshman. Part B is a list of six books that would be 
much more ambitious choices either because of length (The Aeneid) or intrinsic 
difficulty (The Confidence-Man) Our goal is to offer constructive help.

List A: 37 Books Appropriate for Any College Common Book Program 


1. Edwin Abbott Abbott. Flatland. (1884) This short book is a 
mathematician’s foray into fiction with a story about two- 
dimensional creatures — squares, triangles, and such — living on a 
plane. Their conceptual horizons are challenged when a three- 
dimensional creature, a sphere, drops in. We picked it because 
(a) it is a deft analogy for us of three-dimensional creatures trying 
to imagine our four-or-more dimensional universe, (b) it is one of 
few mathematical classics completely open to math-resistant 
students, and (c) it is a subtle provocation to students to open 
their minds to unexpected intellectual possibilities. It also contains 
amusing social satire.

some mild but 


Things fall apart 


2. Chinua Achebe. Things Fall Apart. (1958) Among the first 
African novels written in English, Things Fall Apart depicts the 
Igbo of southern Nigeria during the period of initial Western 
colonization. The protagonist is an ambitious young man in a 
traditional village who gains fame through a feat of wrestling and 
goes on to become a powerful leader, only to see his world 
collapse. We picked it because (a) it is a classic indictment of 
colonialism but comes with the complicating twist that it is written 
in a colonial language by an author who has thoroughly absorbed 
a Western aesthetic sensibility; and (b) it puts the real questions of cultural 
relativism on the table. 





3. James Agee. A Death in the Family. (1957) A posthumous 
autobiographical novel, A Death in the Family is based on the 
death of his father in an automobile accident when Agee was only 
six. The novel richly depicts life in Knoxville, Tennessee around 
1915. We picked it because of (a) the sheer beauty of Agee’s 
writing and its emotional depth, (b) its capacity to become a lasting 
presence in the lives of its readers, (c) the opportunity it affords 
independent-minded college students to think about the fragility of 
family and community and their own rootedness in the world.

4. Augustine. Confessions. (398 A.D.) The Confessions is 
perhaps the very first autobiography, at least in the modern 
sense of someone examining the interior side of his life as 
well as the external events. We picked it because (a) it 
shows a smart, ambitious student who thirsts for knowledge 
and who makes the most of his academic studies, (b) it 
presents the challenge of taking ideas not just as cold objects 
of study but as insights that may have life-changing 
consequences, and (c) it is one of the key books for 
understanding what is distinctive about Western civilization. 



5. John Bunyan. The Pilgrim’s Progress. (1678) Once the 
most widely read book in English besides the Bible, The 
Pilgrim ’s Progress is an astonishingly successful allegory. 
We picked it because it is (a) a key influence on English 
fiction, (b) a tour-de-force of metaphor and analogy, and (c) 
a vivid introduction to Christianity that secular students can 
grasp. Though accessible to children at one level, The 
Pilgrim’s Progress has depths of psychological and moral 
insight that fully justify it as a reading for college students. 



6. Albert Camus. The Plague. (1947) The novel depicts a city in French 
colonial Algeria that is quarantined during an outbreak of the 
bubonic plague. Camus describes the divergent ways those 
trapped in the city cope with the situation. We picked it 
because it is a compelling depiction of some of the great themes 
of 20 lh century existential philosophy: the sense of a 
meaningless void against which humans struggle to achieve a 
sense of dignity; the feelings of alienation and exile poised 
against human solidarity and love; and the demand for 
something better than personal happiness. 



7. Willa Cather. Death Comes for the Archbishop . (1927) 
This episodic novel, based on the life of Jean-Baptiste Lamy, 
depicts the work of a devout French priest sent to reorganize the 
Catholic mission in New Mexico after the territory has been 
annexed by the United States. We picked it because (a) 

Cather’ s quietly expansive vision of the American landscape is 



80 







Beach Books 2011-2012 
National Association of Scholars 


an unsurpassed literary accomplishment, (b) students can gain something vital 
from this account of steady purpose in the pursuit of an ideal, and (c) the book 
offers a perspective on the mingling of cultures that strongly contrasts to the 
currently fashionable accounts of ethnic antagonism. 

8. James Fenimore Cooper. The Last of the Mohicans. 

(1826) By the time Cooper wrote this novel, the French and 
Indian War was as distant a memory as World War II is today. 

The story is a complicated account of the sharp-shooting white 
orphan Hawkeye, raised by Indians to protect the daughters of a 
British colonel from the perils of war and the unwanted 
attentions of a treacherous Huron warrior. We picked it 
because, (a) despite its wildly implausible plot, the book 
captures America’s exuberant vision of itself early in our 
history, (b) Cooper’s romantic sense of place and sense of 
nostalgia for the lost grandeur of the Native American tribes of the east can also 
enrich contemporary students’ understanding of their national heritage, and (c) the 
book is one kind of answer to the question, “Who are we?” And the answer 
involves a lot more cultural and racial “hybridity” than we typically recognize in 
the writings of America’s first professional writers. 

9. Charles Darwin. The Voyage of the Beagle. (1839) This is 
Darwin’s classic account of his expedition from 1831 to 1836 
around coastal South America to the Galapagos Islands, Tahiti, 

Australia, across the Indian Ocean to Mauritius, and back to 
England, on which he made most of the observations that led 
eventually to his theory of evolution by natural selection. 

(The Voyage went through several editions and one of the 
augmented later ones might be a better choice.) We picked it 
because (a) it is a dazzling display of young Darwin’s curiosity 
and his powers of observation of people and places as well as the natural world, (b) 
students can benefit from a robust example of careful observation and collection of 
facts as worthy pursuits in their own right, and (c) The Voyage offers a fresh point 
of entry into the intellectual adventure of scientific inquiry. 

10. Charles Dickens. American Notes for General Circulation. (1842) Dickens 




81 





Beach Books 2011-2012 
National Association of Scholars 



published this account of his travels just after his six-month visit 
to the United States. It is an unflattering portrait of a country that 
effusively welcomed him — far too effusively in his judgment. 

We picked it because (a) Dickens’ account of American character 
still resonates, (b) the book lampoons qualities in which 
Americans continue to take pride, and (c) it raises important 
questions about celebrity, status, travel, crime, law, and a host of 
other themes that still preoccupy us. 


11. Ralph Ellison. Invisible Man. (1952) This novel presents the memory of an 
unnamed African-American character who is currently living as a 
hermit in the basement of a New York City apartment building. 

In his youth in a small southern town he was school valedictorian 
and went on to college but was expelled. As he struggles to 
make a life for himself, he encounters a succession of people — 
most of whom see him not as the individual that he is but only in 
relation to their particular take on race — promoting various 
responses to white oppression: accommodation, communism, 
black nationalism, and cynicism. We picked it because (a) it is a 
powerful evocation of the deadening quality of ideological responses to racism, 
and (b) it depicts the struggle for individuality in circumstances that strongly 
reinforce the claims of group identity. These are very much living questions on 
most college campuses. 


RALPH ELLISON’S 




12. David Hackett Fischer. Washington’s Crossing. (2004) We 
wanted to include a book about George Washington and had 
hundreds to pick from. We chose Fischer’s account of a pivotal 
moment, when General Washington, faced with the imminent 
collapse of the whole revolution, seized the initiative by crossing 
the Delaware River on Christmas night and mounting a surprise 
attack on the Hessian garrison at Trenton. We picked it because 
(a) Washington is a difficult figure for today’s American students 
to comprehend, and Fischer succeeds admirably in showing him 
as a vivid human being, (b) the book takes us out of “the 
American Revolution” as an abstraction and gives us a sense of the war as a matter 
of real choices made under life-and-death conditions, and (c) it is the kind of 
history writing that will whet students’ appetites for more. 



13. Benjamin Franklin. Autobiography. (1791) This unfinished autobiography, 


82 



Beach Books 2011-2012 
National Association of Scholars 


written as a letter to his son, opens a window into the life and 
mind of one of our nation’s most beloved founding fathers. We 
picked it because (a) it captures Franklin’s unique genius as 
equally accomplished as a scientist, inventor, entrepreneur, 
publisher, creative writer, aphorist, diplomat, and political 
thinker, (b) American college students should be familiar with 
the framers of the country, and Franklin stands out not only as 
the elder statesman of the Revolution but as one of the shapers 
of American character, (c) in our new age of thrift, Franklin’s 
wisdom — (Fie coined the phrase, “Time is money” in 
his Advice to a Young Tradesman, 1748) — bears new attention. 


The Autobiography of 

BENJAMIN 

FRANKLIN 



14. Nathaniel Hawthorne. The Blithedale Romance . (1852) 

This is Hawthorne’s fictionalized account of the utopian Brook 
Farm community in which he participated for eight months in 
1841. The tale includes characters whose contemporary 
counterparts will soon be part of the lives of the students 
entering college: a charismatic hater of the free market, an 
advocate of “freedom” intent on imposing her own tyranny, 
weak-willed followers eager to find someone to tell them what 
to think, aesthetes, and people eager to hide their ordinary 
appetites behind exotic poses. We picked The Blithedale 
Romance because (a) it is an effective warning against the seductions of 
utopianism, and (b) it helps us see that longing for social justice needs to be 
grounded in real understanding of human nature. 

15. William Least Heat-Moon. Blue Highways. (1982) Heat- 
Moon heads out to see America from the vantage point of the 
back roads — the ones colored blue on highway maps. The book 
is largely built on the conversations he has with the people he 
meets: saloon keepers, fishermen, farmers, a prostitute, a 
Christian hitchhiker, a Hopi medical student and more. We 
chose it because (a) it is a quietly evocative picture of 
America — one that has stood the test of time, and (b) it is a 
model of first-person writing in which the speaker is unobtrusive 
and doesn’t get in the way of what he sees and hears. 




16. Zora Neale Hurston. Their Eyes Were Watching God. (1937) This novel by 
African-American folklorist and anthropologist Zora Neale Hurston depicts the life 


83 




Beach Books 2011-2012 
National Association of Scholars 


of a thrice-married Florida woman who kills her last husband in 
self-defense. Much of the dialogue is in black dialect and book 
has often been criticized for trading in stereotypes. We chose it 
because (a) it is an unromanticized picture of social oppression 
as well as of some fascinating and vanished American 
subcultures, and (b) a consummate work of artistry by a writer 
who defied the conventions of her time. 



the death

cities 


17. Jane Jacobs. The Death and Life of Great American 
Cities. (1961) This book started the movement for preserving 
old neighborhoods in America. It was written as a critique of 
the kind of “urban renewal” that consisted of flattening whole 
sections of cities and replacing them with sterile modernist 
structures that had no connection with actual human 
communities. She was especially opposed to urban 
expressways. But Jacobs’ book somehow transcends the policy 
debates that gave birth to it. We chose it because (a) it is a model of public policy 
advocacy, (b) it remains a compelling vision of the best of urban life, and (c) it can 
provoke students to think more deeply about the material basis of American life: 
how our prosperity, our sense of community, depend on our use of space. 


18. Rudyard Kipling. Kim. (1901) This is a book that vividly 
portrays British colonial India through a homeless white orphan’s 
eyes. We picked it because it (a) raises provocative questions 
about contemporary American views of personal identity, 
multiculturalism and colonialism, and (b) is an extraordinarily 
artful tale of political intrigue. American higher education today 
spends considerable effort denouncing colonialism, post- 
colonialism, Orientalism, etc. Why not give students a chance to read a 
masterpiece from the writer who was one of colonialism’s greatest and most 
sophisticated admirers? 

19. Arthur Koestler. Darkness at Noon. (1940) In this novel, 

Koestler, a former communist, depicts the world of Stalin’s show 
trials. The protagonist, Rubashov, is a true believer in the 
communist system, but is arrested, interrogated, and struggles 
with the meaning of his life and loyalties as he awaits his certain 
execution. The book is one of the classics of anti-totalitarian 
literature. We picked it because (a) it powerfully portrays the 




84 


Beach Books 2011-2012 
National Association of Scholars 


awful system of oppression at the heart of the Soviet system, (b) it is a testimony to 
the profound importance of individual rights and political freedom — so easily 
taken for granted by those who have always enjoyed them, and (c) Koestler takes 
us inside the mind of someone trapped by ideology. 

20. Sinclair Lewis. Babbit. (1922) Babbit is a partner in an upper 
Midwest real estate firm in this satiric novel. His life is devoted to 
social climbing until in a moment of crisis he realizes the vapidity 
of his materialism. At that point he plunges headlong into flouting 
social conventions, but eventually becomes disillusioned with the 
emptiness of rebellion as well. We picked this book because it is 
the classic indictment of American middle class complacency, and 
students deserve the chance to think this through. Is American life the sum of 
culturally dead self-seeking Babbits who conform even in their non-conformity? 
How true is this picture? 




21. Abraham Lincoln. Selected Speeches and Writings. (1832- 
1865, published in this volume in 2009) (Selections) It was the 
Great Emancipator who held the United States together during the 
Civil War. His strength of character, sharp wit, and quest for 
peace made him one of our nation’s greatest presidents. Of all 
Lincoln’s speeches, our strongest recommendations for students 
are these three: the speech on the Kansas-Nebraska Act at Peoria 
(October 16, 1854); the address to the Washington Temperance 
Society of Springfield, Illinois (February 22, 1842); and the 
second inaugural address (March 4, 1865). And one of the best ways to leam the 
power of persuasive argument is to read some of the Lincoln-Douglas debates on 
slavery. 


Selected Speeches 
and Writings 


22. John Stuart Mill. On Liberty. (1869) This is a short book 
on the limits of political power. Mill argues, most importantly, 
for freedom of thought and speech, and points out that partisans 
who suppress criticism ultimately weaken the views they are 
trying to protect. We picked On Liberty because (a) the 
substance of the essay bears directly on contemporary higher 
education, where “political correctness” has limited the liberty to 
discuss important ideas, and (b) the book is a model of lucid philosophical 
exposition.

23. George Orwell. Homage to Catalonia. (1938) Orwell, a 
journalist, reflects on his experiences during the Spanish Civil 
War from December 1936 to June 1937, where he had the 
misfortune to enlist in a non- Stalinist Marxist militia that Soviet- 
controlled communists had secretly determined to liquidate. 

Betrayed by people he mistook as allies, Orwell began a painful 
reconsideration of his views. He remained a socialist but had 
grown wise to the lawless nature of totalitarian regimes, and he 
came to loathe Stalinism. We picked this book because (a) it 
represents a genuine act of personal courage, (b) it vividly depicts 
the human reality of the great contest of political ideals that defined the twentieth 
century, and (c) it exemplifies lucid political writing. 

24. Plato. Apology of Socrates and Crito. (c. 399-387 B.C.) These 
are key works of philosophy that students who sign up for a 
philosophy course will probably read. But they are a common 
inheritance that everyone should know, and they can be read easily 
without a teacher’s assistance. The Apology is Socrates’ self-defense 
when he is charged with corrupting the youth of Athens. Crito is 
Socrates explanation to a friend why he must obey the laws of Athens 
and accept the death penalty. We picked these two dialogues because together 
they present a profound debate about the place of the intellectual in socie ty, the 
pursuit of truth, and the necessity of the law. 

25. Plutarch. Parallel Lives. (Second century A.D.) (Selections) 

Plutarch pairs biographies of famous men, one Greek, one Roman, 
to illuminate their character. We picked it because (a) it gives 
students a vibrant, narrative view of ancient Greek and Roman 
culture, (b) it examines what it means to be “good,” and (c) as a 
commentary on leadership, it influenced the writers of The 
Federalist Papers. 

26. Alexander Pope. Essay on Criticism. (1711) This is the only 
English verse on our list. Pope’s poem begins with a warning that 
incompetent criticism poses a greater danger than poor creative 
writing. The latter “tries our patience,” but poor judgment offered 
up authoritatively can “mis-lead our Sense.” The Essay on 
Criticism can be read hurriedly and with no profit, but for the reader

who pays attention, it is a font of good insight. We picked it because (a) it 
emphasizes the need for a moral seriousness in the critical inquiries that lie ahead 
for the college student, (b) it is one of those rare works that fully embodies the 
strictures it lays down: it practices what it preaches, and (c) it just might help some 
students improve their writing. 


27. William Shakespeare. Julius Caesar, (c. 1599) This play 
once was and should still be a standard part of the high school 
English curriculum, but it is not. We picked it (a) to restore a vital 
literary reference point, (b) to invite students to think about 
demagoguery and the willingness of people to sacrifice freedom to 
follow a charismatic leader, and (c) to urge students to reflect on 
conflicts between personal loyalty and public duty. 


28. William Shakespeare. Richard III. (c. 1592) This play offers 
one of Shakespeare’s great villains, who despite his awful deeds 
somehow wins a share of our sympathy. We picked it because it is 
English literature’s best portrayal of political manipulation and 
cunning self-advancement, which are qualities that students need 
to be on guard against in college no less than in the rest of life. 


29. William Shakespeare. Henry V. (c. 1598) This play is about 
the maturation of a king and his extraordinary success on the 
battlefield. The St. Crispin’s Day speech is one that every student 
should know. We picked Henry V because it is the richest of 
Shakespeare’s history plays. It has profound things to say about 
the responsibilities of leadership. 

30. Robert Louis Stevenson. A Footnote to History: Eight 

Years of Trouble in Samoa. (1892) The author of Treasure 
Island and The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and 
other popular works moved to Samoa in 1 890 in search of a 
place to recover his health. This book is his account of the 
colonial struggle to possess the island, as the United States, 

Germany, and Britain squabbled with each other and a 
hopelessly outgunned Samoan king. Stevenson is on the 
side of the Samoans. The New York Times hailed the book 
on its first publication as “an entertaining and brilliant piece 
of narrative.” We picked it because (a) it is a superbly written work that makes an

otherwise forgotten episode in colonial history into a lens for the vanities of 
politics and power, and (b) it is a good benchmark for students to think about 
American military ventures in faraway places. 


31. Mark Twain. Life on the Mississippi. (1883) Twain is 
remembering his life before the Civil War as an apprentice 
steamboat pilot. The book is as broad and digressive as the river 
itself, but we have a charming companion to keep it interesting. 
We picked it because (a) Twain is one of the great native talents 
of American literature and Life on the Mississippi shows him in 
a genial mood, (b) the book opens a window on a distinctly 
American combination of technical expertise, intellectual 
aspiration, and ironic observation. 

32. Voltaire. Candide. (1759) This eighteenth century satire 
of a young man under the spell of a philosophy that glibly treats 
the order of the world as “all for the best,” would seem to be 
superfluous counsel in an age where students are more likely to 
be surrounded by dire warnings that things are bad and about to 
get much worse. But as a story of progressive (and sometime 
hilarious) disillusionment, Candide still has something to 
teach. We picked it because it is a timeless warning not to 
mistake beautiful theories for fact. 




ALL 

THE 

KING’S 

MEN 


33. Robert Penn Warren. All the King’s Men. (1946) 

Warren’s novel about the rise of a populist politician in the 
South presents the interplay of cynical calculation and idealistic 
yearning in American life. Based loosely on the life and death 
of Louisiana governor and senator Huey P. Long, the book is a 
classic portrayal of one of the weaknesses of our system of 
governance. We picked it because (a) it presents political 
corruption but is ultimately a counsel against viewing politics 
as mere manipulation, (b) it is a rich and vivid depiction of the 
insider’s view of political life, and (c) it provides students an occasion to come to 
terms with their own temptation to think of governance as a raw, anything-goes 
game. 


34. James D. Watson. The Double Helix. (1968) Watson’s first-person account 
of the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA continues to provoke 
controversy, especially over Watson’s cursory treatment of Rosalind Franklin,

whose x-ray diffraction images of DNA were crucial to the 
hypothesis that he and his colleague Francis Crick developed. 
Nonetheless the book is a classic insider account of one of the 
great scientific breakthroughs of the last century. We picked it 
because (a) it is a vivid portrayal of how scientific reasoning, 
personal ambition, and individual character come together in 
actual research, and (b) students need to know about some of 
the foundational discoveries that underlie contemporary 
medicine and technology. 



SYLVIA NASAK 


35. Tom Wolfe. The Right Stuff. (1979) This book examines 
the lives of test pilots and astronauts, and chronicles the early 
years of the U.S. manned space program. We picked it 
because (a) Wolfe’s sympathetic engagement with the pilots 
brings to life the human side of this hugely complex scientific 
and technical accomplishment, (b) the book exemplifies the 
rhetorical power of the “new journalism” when it was truly 
new, and (c) it offers a compelling portrait of courage and self- 
reliance. 



36. The Book of Job. (c. 1000 B.C.) Among the most profound 
and unsettling stories in the Bible, the Book of Job depicts a 
righteous man brought to the depths of suffering by the seeming 
capriciousness of God. Job rejects the counsel of his friends to 
curse God for his fate, but he does eventually complain. God’s 
answer is awesome — and frightening. We picked this book 
because (a) it is among the most accessible points of entry to 
the Bible for secular students, and (b) it is a terrific story that 
can lead to important questions about the nature of justice. 

37. The Book of Ecclesiastes . (c. 970-930 B.C.) A king searches for meaning in 
life by successively seeking wisdom, pleasure, wealth, sex, and 
power. Having achieved them, he finds that they fail to fulfill 
his longings and are ultimately meaningless. We picked this 
book because it asks many of life’s deepest questions: Why 
work so hard if it doesn’t bring real happiness and death is 
inevitable? What is there to live for, really? Why do bad things 
happen to good people? Why are some people wealthy while 
others are poor? In this way it also speaks to the rising concern

on college campuses for social justice. 


List B: Six More Ambitious Choices 

1. Harold Bloom. The Western Canon. (1994) Bloom’s enthusiasm for great 
books is infectious. Students won’t have read many of the books he discusses but 
will want to. 

2. Alexis De Tocqueville. Democracy in America. (1838) De Tocqueville remains 
the best observer of the American social and political experiment. A long read but 
not inherently difficult. 

3. Fyodor Dostoevsky. Crime and Punishment. (1866) A psychological 
masterpiece. No one regrets reading it, though it is a long journey. 

4. Herman Melville. The Confidence-Man. (1857) Easy to read but baffling to 
some readers, since Melville refuses to say exactly who among the large cast of 
characters aboard the Mississippi steam ship Fidele is the confidence man. Is 
America a confidence game? 

5. Gary Rose, ed. Shaping a Nation: 25 Supreme Court Cases. (2010) We are a 
nation of laws — and of Supreme Court opinions. It is a good idea for students to 
start college having read some of the most important ones. 

6. Virgil. The Aeneid. (19 B.C., Fagles’s translation, 2006) An epic in every 
sense, The Aeneid is one of the masterpieces of Western civilization.
