ABSTRACT 



Los Compadres is a program that pairs advanced high school 
Spanish students with elementary English-as -a- Second-Language native Spanish 
speakers. Teachers prepare lessons based upon authentic literature, written 
in English and Spanish, which include vocabulary review and literature 
response activities. The high school students prepare for the lessons by 
reading the stories in both languages. Elementary students have the 
opportunity to have a mentor who is capable of and enthusiastic about 
speaking their native language and who reads to them in both languages. The 
mentor models the importance of understanding the reading by engaging in 
literature response activities while the two interact in both languages. Both 
students benefit with increased vocabulary, oral communication, listening 
proficiency, self-esteem, and reading competence. Teachers of both students 
have many authentic assessment opportunities. Special events focused around 
Hispanic culture provide an opportunity for reluctant non-English proficient 
parents to participate in school -based functions. This packet includes a 
program template, sample lesson plans, Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills 
connection, sample parent letters, sample special event invitations, and book 
resources. Appended are slides that summarize the program and were presented 
at the Annual Meeting of Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages 
(TESQL) (St. Louis, MO, February 27-March 3, 2001). (SM)

LOS COAAPADRES 




ESL Student Mentor Program 



Mission Statement: 

The Los Compadres program has the mission to enhance foreign language acquisition in 
a mentor atmosphere through bilingual literature and literature response activities. 



Description of Program: 

"Los Compadres" is a program which pairs advanced high school Spanish students with 
elementary ESL native Spanish speakers. Teachers prepare lessons based upon authentic 
literature, written in English and Spanish, which include vocabulary review and literature 
response activities. The H.S. students prepare for the lessons by reading the stories in 
both languages, which enhances their own foreign language vocabulary and 
understanding of grammar and syntax. The elementary students have the opportunity to 
have a mentor who is capable of and enthusiastic about speaking the child's native 
language, and who reads to them in both their native language and English. Additionally, 
the mentor models the importance of understanding the reading by engaging in literature 
response activities while the two interact in both languages. Both students benefit with 
increased vocabulary, oral communication and listening proficiency, self-esteem, and 
reading competence in their respective foreign language. The teachers of both students 
have many authentic assessment opportunities, which can be documented by video, 
written response, and/or oral interaction evaluations. Also, special events focused around 
Hispanic cultural celebrations provide an opportunity for reluctant non-English proficient 
parents to participate in school-based functions. This program is one that has benefits for 
all involved!

Lesson plans should be based on bilingual literature. It is helpful to have the books side by side to note 
similarities and differences in language and translations. Include TAAS-related criteria in your lesson 
plans: vocabulary development, book and text structures, re-telling (main idea) in both languages. 
Literature response activities can be created depending on grade-level and proficiency level of the ESL 
students who will be listening / reading the books. 

Over time, you will want your lesson plan library to include books on many subjects and a variety of 
difficulty levels. Literature response activities can include: 

Art projects 

TAAS-related activities 
Internet Research 
Personal Connections 
Venn Diagrams 
Comprehension activities 
Word-play activities 
Creative writing 
Reader’s Theater 

Assessment part of Lesson Plan: For ESL students 

It is a good idea to have the H,S. students assessing how the lesson went. The following might be included: 

1, Was (were) the student(s) able to retell the story in Spanish? In English? 

2. How was (were) the student(s) attitude(s)? 

3. What went well? Did anything go poorly? 

4, Did the activity work? How engaged was (were) the student(s)? 

Assessment for the H.S. students: 

It is a good idea to have the H,S. students self-assess their own learning. The following might be included 
(maybe written and answered in Spanish!): 

1. Was I well-prepared for the lesson? Why or Why not? 

2. How well did I read the story in Spanish? 

3. What words did I have trouble pronouncing? 

4. What words/phrases did I learn through this experience? 

5. What did the ESL student learn from me? 

6. What did I learn from the ESL student? 

Spanish teacher can record self-assessment oral conversations in Spanish for proficiency progress checks. 
The day after Los Compadres would be a good time for them to do the self-assessment as well as choose 
the next lesson. 



Ccttm$ StAitct>: 

Your students, from both campuses, will enjoy and learn from Los Compadres if they know what to expect, 
and what is expected of them. 

Preparation: 

It may be a good idea to have parent permission for this program, (see Enclosure) 

ESL students: 

Let the students know they will be meeting a new friend from the High School who is 
learning to speak Spanish. Be specific about the following: 

1. Date and time of the Compadres visit. 

2, Where they will be during the visit.

n 



3. Where you, their teacher will be during the visit. 

4. How the ESL student should behave during the meeting. 

5. What the expectations for learning are. 

6. Encourage the use of both languages. 

High School students: 

Set a time that the Elementary teacher(s) and the Spanish teachers can meet with the High 
School students to discuss the program, the mission statement, description of the program, and go 
through a sample lesson plan. Also, provide a syllabus (see enclosure) and be specific about the 
following: 

1 . Date and time of their visits 

2. It going to the Elementary campus, who will greet them and any 
school visitor requirements that need to be addressed. 

3. Where both the ESL teacher and the High School teacher will be 
during the visit. 

4. How the H.S. student and the ESL students should behave during 
the visit. 

5. What the expectations for learning are.

7. Encourage the use of both languages. 

8. What to do if a problem arises (with behavior, and any other 
possible concern). 

9. Discuss how the two schools can communicate with each other. 



The First Visit: 

The success of the program can hinge upon the success of the first meeting. BE PREPARED! For 
the first visit, you may want to have all the students come together for a reading of a story in both 
languages (by the teacher(s)), and then a group activity where the students can get to know one 
another. You may have decided to pair up the students beforehand, or let them get to know each 
other and have them choose for themselves.

CwltMTAl tvctits / ?Arc»it iMvolvcmctit 

As teachers of ESL students, we know how difficult it can be to gain parental support and involvement in a 
dominantly English-speaking school. Plan to celebrate one to two special native-cultural events per 
semester, and invite the parents to participate. These events can provide an opportunity for parents of ESL 
students (as well as the H.S. students’ parents) to become involved in their child’s education. Here are 
some cultural events that could be studied by ESL students and H.S. Spanish learners: 

• Diez y Seis de Septiembre 

• Dia de los Muertos 

• Las Posadas 

• Los Reyes Magos 

• El Dia del Nino 

• Cinco de Mayo 

• Fiesta (in San Antonio and surrounding areas) 

Invite the parents to do any of the following: 

• Cook traditional dishes 

• Demonstrate how to make traditional dishes 

• Discuss in Spanish or English native traditions or celebrations 

• Bring in cultural materials or wear traditional clothing 

Special events can be during the regularly scheduled Los Compadres time or all-day affairs. When doing 
special events, be sure to let the parents know what is going on and invite them to attend. You may need 
make special arrangements or get parent permission if you are going to transport the students off-campus, 
use a large area for a special event, or possibly bring in a guest speaker. So plan way ahead. You may 
decide not to do any special events during your pilot year.

Syllabus 



High School Teachers 

Mr. Joe Cisneros 
Ms. Claudia Cary 



Elementary Teachers 

Ms. Joellen Coryell 
Ms. Edna Gonzales 



Objectives 

To practice the basic skills of the Spanish language with Spanish- 
speaking ESL students in the elementary level. 

To help the ESL student become proficient in the English language 
through the use of authentic literature in English and Spanish. 

To become a role model and mentor to the elementary ESL student 
showing enthusiasm and the importance of being bilingual. 

To take part of the cultural activities of the Spanish-speaking world and to 
understand the different aspects of the culture important to Spanish speakers. 

Lessons 

The High School students will be working in groups to prepare and 
present a lesson to the elementary students. The presentation of the lesson will 
include the reading of a book in English and in Spanish along with one or two 
activities related to the book. The books will be provided by the teachers. The 
H.S. students will design the related activities and will implement them in the 
elementary classroom. At the end of the lesson the student will have to prepare a 
critique reflecting on the outcome of their lesson and turn it in at the beginning of 
next day’s Spanish class. 

Attendance 

We will have scheduled visits to the elementary school. It is very 

important that we prepare and attend all. If a student is absent to one of these 
visits then the student will have to make up the work by completing an alternate 
assignment given by the H.S. teacher. Time to complete the make-up work will 
be in accordance with the student handbook. 

Transportation 

We will ride the school bus to and from the elementary schools. The 
students are not allowed to drive their own car. The bus will leave the H.S. at 

promptly. If a student is late and the bus leaves without him or her, 

the student will have to report to the library and will remain there for the entire 
period. There will be an assignment to be completed in the library and it will be 
due the next day. Remember that we do not accept late work so failure to do the 
assignment will result in a grade of zero. 




33 



Grading 

The students will receive one grade for the preparation of the lesson in 
class, one grade for each lesson’s critique, and one grade for the performance of 
the lesson. The average of those three grades will become one test grade. 



Remember that you are a big part for the success of this program so your 
participation and enthusiasm are of utmost importance. 

Most of all, enjoy yourself and let’s have fun!
