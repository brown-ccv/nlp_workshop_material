Introduction 

to Second Edition 
1998 

This second edition retains an emphasis on a range of authentic voices with 
respect for some realistic voices for African Americans, Asians Americans, Latina/o 
Americans and Native Americans. Authentic voices, compare to diamonds in that they 
provide genuine perspectives from individuals who have the expertise, life experiences 
and group identity membership to provide genuine realism to the diverse text 
interpretations they create. Realistic voices compare to zircons in that they are the voices 
of keen observers who often provide brilliant presentations, but, nonetheless, such 
accounts are not authentic. 



The over 1400 titles for younger and older children more than double the number 
of selections in the first edition. Since embarking on this project a number of years ago, I 
have engaged in many discussions, attended lectures and talks, and read much about 
authentic and realistic voices. Thus, Xhs diamond - authentic and zircon - realistic 
distinction that I made in the introduction to the first edition, and at times elsewhere in 
my numerous lectures and talks (see Appendix B) remains ever so important as we 
continue this work of identifying voices in literature. Also, like the earlier edition, this 
one is an ongoing effort to respect the ethnic and cultural integrity of the authors and 
illustrators and any unintentional errors will be subject to correction in future editions. 



Many relatively recent titles have been added and it has been a pleasure 
identifying them. Admittedly, some titles on this bibliography may be difficult to find for 
any number of reasons such as: only limited editions were available from a small 
independent publisher; a larger publisher’s marketing strategies failed to yield the profit 
margin desired so publication of a work ceased; or local librarians and book store owners 
believed there wasn’t a demand amongst their readership. As a consequence of limited 
availability, it is a challenge to find some selections and a reward to be able to read these 
literary treasures. It’s ironic how often that both majority and minority group merribers, 
in spite of how schooled/educated they are, demonstrate personal amazement after 
reading or hearing works by authors who were omitted from their childhood, high school, 
and college canonical experiences. Maybe by discovering, uncovering or recovering a 
work of art that you didn’t know existed, you will become a part of a movement that 
generates a demand for reprinting as well as copyright renewals of particular works for 
distribution to a wider and larger audience. The author lists which follow each of the five 
major bibliographical sections should also be helpful in identifying additional selections 
in your future. 



My final introductory remarks to this second edition pertain to inquiries about 
literature which are often couched in award winning status commentaries. Although 
“winniug selections” are certainly entitled to accolades, such recognition is merely the 
reflection of being recognized by a few and then catapulted publicly to the attention of 
many. Keep an open mind that for every award winner, there are probably other books 
that are as enriching to a readership. Some selections, for whatever the reasons, just 
don’t appeal to a particular set of critics. As a reader, let the freedom of your ovm

independent thinking decide the worth of a book or story. Continue to experience and

Introduction 

to First Edition 
1996 



Compiling a bibliography for others is an idiosyncratic, yet, well meaning 
practice. Such is the case for this effort and here are the reasons. 

1. This bibliography focuses on four major ethnic groups: African Americans, 
Asian Americans, Latino Americans and Native Americans. 

This is done with the understanding that none of these groups are monolithic and 
each group has an infinite range of diversity. This bibliographical effort is respectful that 
the people within these groups have been inculcated with ethnic and cultural connections, 
as well as, with universal practices and patterns of behavior. 

2, This bibliography emphasizes authentic and realistic voices. 

Authentic voices are likened to diamonds because they provide genuine 
perspectives from individuals who have the expertise, life experiences and group identity 
membership to provide authentic realism to the words, tenets, accounts, and 
interpretations of the text they are creating. Within the parameters of authenticity there is 
diverse latitude of representative voices. Realistic voices are likened to zircons. They 
are voices of keen observers whose discourse may be excellent or superb; their discourse, 
whatever the genre may appear real, and in some cases they may give brilliant 
presentations which outshine authentic voices. Nonetheless, like a zircon, which looks 
and functions in many respects like a diamond , but is not a diamond, so are the cases of 
realistic accounts in both fiction and non fiction discourses. This resource presents 
authentic and realistic voices. The authentic works (authors and illustrators) are 
identified with an asterisk (*). Any errors noting authentic voices are unintentional and 
all attempts will be made to correct them in future editions. 

Avoided in this compilation were the detached observers, the authors, whose 
discourse echoed a non-vested interest. Unlike authentic and realistic voices, detached 
observers tend to view certain people, events, and activities as remote objects of the 
discourse rather than subjects within the genre. Any one or a combination of the 
following human constraints: ignorance, naivete, supremacy conditioning or privileged 
status enables such voices to marginalize - impersonalize - minimize information about 
the people, events, settings, themes, differentness, and historical connectedness so 
integral to any discourse. Certainly, point of view is a basic literary element. However, 
too often, many people become comfortable getting their understanding of others, who 
are culturally and ethnically unlike themselves, from secondary sources. They read, 
listen, and use descriptions provided by those whose observations, at best, provide a 
remote point of view.

3. This bibliography supports a literary challenge that is never ending ... never 
done ... 

The work of locating, creating, disseminating, and understanding multicultural / 
multiethnic literature is an ongoing process because such work cannot be definitive. This 
is how it must be, much to the chagrin of some and to the delight of others. 

4. This bibliography transcends age groups. 

It is easy to define young children as bigger than infants though not yet 
adolescents. It is also easy to define older children because no matter how old one 
becomes, he or she is always someone’s child. Because there are so many aspects of 
literature written for children that capture the sensibilities of adults, and, because 
literature written for adults often contains gems of wisdom and vignettes about life to be 
treasured by children, this source is for younger and older children. Rather than judge 
mentally what is chronologically suitable for a specific audience, that decision is left to 
the individual (which in many cases will be a teacher, librarian, parent, or other 
significant person in a young child’s life). Obviously, there are portions and selections in 
books which are generally written for adults that are not suitable for children. However, 
within those very same books there are often passages and stories which can delight the 
hearts, challenge one’s own and other’s thought, align the past, explain the present,. and 
predict the future of both the young, the old, and those who are somewhere in between. It 
is the individual who must decide how to allow literature, such as the selections included 
here, to nurture the hearts, inform the minds, and ignite the dreams of younger and older 
children.

Books about Latinos 
2nd Edition - 1998 



Mindful of their unique cultural distinctions which become blurred 
and ignored by the term Hispanic, Latinos define themselves. 

They are Mexican-Americans and Chicanos, Puerto Ricans and 
Nuyoricans, Cubans, Dominicans, Guatematecos, Chileans, 
Venezuelans and others. They are the sons and daughters who 
have come from the more than twenty Spanish speaking countries 
and United States' territories in the Western hemisphere and they 
are the descendants of those sons and daughters.

publishers to present plurali.stic images to young children.)
