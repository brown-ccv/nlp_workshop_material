ABSTRACT 

I^splte the Importance of chl^.dren's literature 
written by and about people of color, little multiethnic literature 
is avall^le. However, the situation has improved somewhat. In recent 
years there has been a greater focis in African-American literature 
upon folk tales, family stories, tamiiy histories, and biographies. 
Still, books about the Hlsp^lc, Asian, or Native American ei^rience 
mostly have tended to be written about, not }y, members of those 
groups. An examination of stories from trade books and basal reading 
programs presented on the third-grade level found no non-white main 
characters. No other ethnic groups were represented. A similar 
scarcity of multicultural content was found in former U.S. secretary 
of Education William Bemiett's suggested reading list and Jim 
Trelease's 1989 reading list. Readers from ccnuBerclal publishers 
reflected greater diversity. The examination of multiethnic 
literature raises such questions as: who is writing the works; how 
ethnic groups are portrayal in illustrations; whether stereotypes are 
employed; whether separate cultures are grouped together under such 
labels as "Hispanic" or "Asian"; how broad an ethnic selection of 
reading naterial is presented to children; and how long multiethnic 
literature remains in publication. As multiethnic literature is ma'^e 
more available, demand for it will increase. (A list of 44 references 
is attached.) (SG)

MulUethnic Literature - I 



Abstract 

The fiwt part of this report surveys llie past 25 years of the pubUsfabg of mulikUmic Uterature- 
documenting trends and analyzing the content of the bw*s that have been published. The second part 
surveys trade books and basal scries cnrretdy used in schools for their inclusion of storks and 
iUttstrations featuring different ethnic groups. Fmally, six issi»s are raised: the predominance of 
European-American authors writing about people of color, the ethnicaUy nondistinctive chUd in 
illustrations, hypersensitivity, cultural grouping, the possibiay of a canon of children*s literature that 
includes multiethnic books, and the limited number of multiethnic books being published.

However, this increase was shoit-Uved. la 1984, when RoHock updated her 1979 annotated bibliograph* 
entitled TJte Black Expmence in Chiidrm's Books, she found that while over 2,000 new books had been 
published yearly for dnidren between 1979 ami 1984, only 100 new titles (13%) cfHtceroed the African- 
American e]q)enen(». This was on average 2S new puUicattons a year. In additicm, many of the titles 
that had been listed in the 1979 edHion were out of prmt by 19S^ Rollock's 1984 editicm was half the 
sin of the 1979 edition, leadii^; her to comment: 

The vdumes (tf material cm tkc Afrkan-Americaa eiqperience fen- children w^iich were 
Bv^labte in the late 196Qs and early 19Tih h&ve dwindted tu a trickle df titles by the 
same familiar authors. Tl» social cmisdmisttess t*«e Civil Rig^ Movement, once 
aroused, now seems dk^ant and has recei^ to the pasuw quku of the years priw 
to the 1960s, (p. 4) 

By the mid-19806, only 1% the chiklren's literaTdre published was about African-Americans; even less 
about Asian-Americans, Hispantcs, and Native Amr ^cans (Bishop, 1987). According to the New York 
Public Lftraiy's The Blxk Bcpaience in Childrm 's IM&mn (1989), a bibliography of African-American 
literature, about 34 titles a year were published «dth African-American characters or iUus(ratioi» 
between 1^ and 1988. A recent survey by Bishop (1991) indicates that currently, less than 2% of the 
2^ to 3,500 children's books published each ^ar are about African-Americans. 

As we entered the lS90s, Bishop (1991) was Of^imistic that despite the significant decrease in books 
about African-Americans in the iskos, the numben were rising again. In contrast, Hopkins (1990), an 
anthologjzsr of poetry for children, has argued that the situation is not improving dramatically: 

It is a fact: Eloise Gr^nfield is the only Black writer of children's poetry currently 
being puUblKd in the Unitui States; her lat^ volume, Ncthaniet Talking (Black 
Butterfly Children's Books) ai^wan^l in 1989. 

It seems quite Incredible that, with over four thousand books for children being 
published annually, America is not seeii^ woric produ^d by Black poets. 

It is dbturbing that such work is not more visible or reattily available to educators and 
children of all rac«i. 

Po^ about the Black experience continues to dwindle, (p. 388) 

Although quantity is a clear indi^tor of the status miUtiethnic children's literature, it does not address 
ihc 'asm ik n^utt kimi of literattve h available for (tifTerent ethnic groui». "^^ ^ ^ 

look at «^ the research says about the content of books about African-Americans, Hispanics, Asian- 
Americans, and Native Americans. 

Children's Literature and the AfHcan-American Experience 

In a 1975 study African-American children's literature. Mills found that the major theme of the 24 
picture books published durii^ 1974 and 1975 tended to be tow/understanding for mhers across races. 
Of these 24 books, 8 w«re folktales, and there was a wide ran^ in length and subject matter in the 
n^n. In some tltt books, the main characters were invcdved in child-like a^iviti^; in (Mfaers, they 
were invidved in gai^ and violence. There was an unusually hi^ number (24) of biographies of 
African-Americans for elementary school chikfaxn, a welcome addition to the literature for that age 
group because they offered role moctels and a sense of identity. Hie 22 biographies published for older 
children did tuA provide the breadth of role models found in the biographies for younger children -- they 
were almost exclusively bic^aphies about athletes. 



Meyer Rcimcr Muliieihnic Literature - 4 

RoUock (1984) noted a simUar trend in the mo&. 

The bk^pfay section features more accounts of athletes or sp«is %ir^ Their 
slOTics remain in print !oi^ afto- their playiag . . , careers (havej ended, and they far 
outnumber biographies <rf Black scientists, artists, dvic leacters and c«hers who have 
ccmtritnited to society as a wfac^. (p. 4) 

In her 1982 study of ISO realistic fiction books about African-Americans, Sims found that realistic fiction 
during the 1970s focused on: 

(1) the importance of warm and lovii^ human reiatHjoships, espedally within the 
family; (2) a sense of community amm^ African-Amerkans; (3) African-American 
hisioiy, heritage, and cukure; (4) a sense of continuity, and (5) the aWIily to survive, 
both physical^ and psychdogicaUy, in the face of ovciwhchning odds. (p. 560) 

Bishop (1990, 1991) has noted b««h an increase in the amount of African-American Uterature bemg 
published and a shift in the content in recent years. Sha has found more African-American folktales, 
more picture books r^eUiag family stc^ and famUy histories, more books for ihc very young with 
Afncan-American characters, and more books that include people from the Caribbean. Biographies 
continue to be published in s^nificant numbers. In addition lo biographies of athletes, these books 
mdude folk heros, historical figures, and current political figures, such as John Henry, Martin Luther 
Kmg, Paul Robeson, Jesse Jackson, and MalcoUn X. 

Children's Literature and the Hispanic Experience 

Hispanic children's literature is comfdex to document because the term Hispanic docs not refer to one 
culture but to a con^erate of Central and South American cultures, each distinct from the others 
Puerto Rican Uterature, for example, is not reprcsentatwe of Mexican-American literature, which is not 
reprcseniatWB of Sahadwan litwaturc. For this reason, bibliographies tend to categorize books by 
countiy of ongm (Nieto^ 1982a, 1982b; Schon, 19«0). 

An^yai^ the 100 children's books available about the Puerto Rican e9q>eriettce avaUable in 1972, Nieto 
(ISBZa) found that all were "pervaded by sexism, racism, and ethnocentric coloniali^jn- (p. 6). In 
additKm, most of these bo(^ were written Puerto Ricans, not ty^^ Of the 56 books about 
Puerto Ricans puUished between 1972 and 1982. hfieto recommend^ 8, she had reservations about 10 
others^ and the rest she considered to be seriously flawed. The primary theme of these books was 
«»siuiflatiMmto the culture of the United Stat^ Though only one half of the Puerto Ricans living in 
the United Stales are m dt^ (primarily New York), most ll» bodes were set in urban ghcttcT^^ 
charactoi were freqi^ caricatures, there was no indication of physical diversity amn!:|t Puerto 
Ricans, dassism was peivasivB, women were ignored, and Puerto Ricans were portraye«* as helpless and 
passive and the cause of their own oppression. v ^ 

Many of the books were retelling of folktales or stories from an author's childhood memories. The 
folktales, with the excepticm of the tales retold by Pura Belpre (e.g., Perez and Marti , i, I960; Dance of 
me Animals, 1965^ were often retold by someone who was not Puerto Rican. Poe;ry. which is often 
?f ^ ^ part of any Puerto Rican social occasion, is noticeably absent in Hispanic 

childrcns literature. In fact, books of HUpanic poetry are rare. In April 1989, Scholastic did publish 
Ir^^ , American songs and rhymes called Arwz con Leche (Delacre, 1989), and Las 

Mniiteifcj (Delacre, 1990) followed b 1990. ^ -»« 

Books published from the mid-19805 to 1990 continued to center on large urban areas and focus on the 
author schHdhood memories. Conlemporaiy books about Mexican Americans arc rare. Schon 
published a bibhography of notable books currently available on the Hispanic experience (1989). The

chiklren's literature. 

Children's Literature and the Asian-American Experience 

As with Hbpanic oitture, there is not (me Asiao-Aoierican culture. Chin««, Jajianese, Kcmans, 
TaiwaiKse. Laotians, Vietnamese, Cambodians, and Filiiniios all haw distimi cultures, iradiiitHis, and 
literary terkag^ In the mcst recent ccHnptdmisfVB bHidk^jr^y (tf Asiao-Amerkan literature (Jenkins 
& AiQttn, 1987), eadi n a t i w ialit y is&cuged sqiarately, biu in all tradUkns, tte cmt^iasis in children's 
Uterature has been on fdktales, myths, and kgends. Scott (1980) su^sts that the reason for this might 
be that fiterature for duldren (&i not exist in Asian ensures umil the usMmtth century. Before that, 
andent ami fonuUar sIotks were tM by stoiy teOns and usually intoided fat adults. 

As with H^tanic literature, most erf the tales are written ^nm Asians rather than by Asians. In the 
past 10 years, there has been an increase in the number of books about the Asian experience in 
America, usually wrinen by Asian-Americans ab<nit tiwir own assimilati<Mi o^riences (a remembiances 
as cfaifairen in the Unked States. Levi's In the Year of the Boar and Jodm Ra^nnson (1984), the story 
of a recent imm^rant from China and her acculturalion to life in the United States, and Uchida's 
Iwmey Heme (1^), llw Aoxy of a Ja|»nese girl's experiracss in CalifcMmia after retumii^ from a 
conceiitration camp in «4ikh she bad been held during World War II, are assimilation and diildhood 
meinories stories. With the exceptitm erf a few books sudi as Ba-Nam (Lee, the story of the 
tradiiions of Thanh-Minh Day when families visit their ancestor's graves in Vietnam, and Tuan (Boholm- 
Olsson, 1^), few bodes had appeared from Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Latxian cultures tnr the end 
of the 19805. 

Children's Literatnre and the Native American Experience 

GiUiland's (1980) bOiIiography of children's books on Native Americans repeats the common Hading that 
ahliot^ there is no du^ts^ (rf bodes about Native Americans, there are very few books by Native 
Americans. She m»ed that many bodes ^>out Native Americans msc load«l voc^ulary (e^., noble and 
savage) and stereotypical characters. Then were few examj^ erf Native Americans that were not 
stereotyped in books for chihiren (Lass-Woodfin, 1978). 

Of the 800 titks fisted m Stensland's U^rature By and About the American Indum (1979), most are 
myths, l^eads, 6ak», or l^)gra^iks. Fdbales luid l^nds, the mo^ frequent genre, are tradUionally 
for adults and dten written f<»' tAiex readers. Fictiem tends to be predonounantfy about Navajos and is 
ofteu wrUten as if tribn were a pec^ from the e^eentii, nin^eenth, ami earfy twentkth centuries. 
In most of the fictkm and bk^r^^, women are absem (Lass-Woodfin, 1978). 

Many current books d^cribe Indians participating in rituals and ceremonies. Although this portrays one 
aspect of Native American life, there are very few books that go beyond this to deal with other issues. 
Jamake Highwater' does go beyond. His writing deals with the spirit worW that is an integral part of 
Native American life. Anpao (1977) is based in folklore but deals with connections to the earth, other 
humans, and the spirit worW in a way that goes beyond the usual "folk-rituals" representation. 
HighwBter's work is unusual-most of ibe books available about Native Americans continue to be 
folktales and legends. 



'Alibou^ his books do seem to <tea) autbcntiainy wuh upem of .\aiive Amerinn life. Jamake Higliwiter a the 
subjeei of Mine ctMitroraisy because he is not of Native American descent. He mainuira. however, thai he has jottied the Plaiiis 
Indian tribe.

Relied to the issue the amottnt ami kind ai mukietbiiic literature being {nd^fisbed is tlw is«» cS y^t 
oiltural ami eUmk vkws tiudems are eiwcHUiaeri^ in tlK»r efemei^^ To address this 

issue, I undertook an investigaaon of the status of mu&iethnic Ikerature in eksmestary schools. In the 
following section, I describe this invest%atk»i. 

The Multiethnidty of Utenitare Used in Schools 

For my inves^ition, I exammed trade books and simies m basal reading i)rograms that were 
appropriate for third-grade stwtenis. I focused c» third-gr^ie-level materials, because they tend to 
indude a s i gnificant amount of meaaingfid text (a sti»y, most often) along wkh the iUustrations. I 
etamiittd ti» awm^iate bools on itatt 1^ tratte bodes thai, are wifteiy leed by teachers and 
parents to select bodts for cfaiUren: Jim Tretease's The New PeadAUmdHmuafOok (1989 edition), the 
International Reading Assodatbn's cauldm's Chdces Award bode list {im edition), ami the list of 
suggested books compiled in 1988 by fonner Secretaiy of Educatitm Wimam Bennett I included the 
examination of stCMries fnm two tesal reading {^ograms becauK some researdiers have {ffoposed that 
basal rewiii^ pn^am pid^tslx»s may be more aware of tl» netd to indudb a varwty of Ihenoure by 
members of ethnic groups than are trade bode publishmg ccmpanies (V. J. Harris, personal 
communication, April 1989; P. D. Pearson, personal communication, Fcbruajy 1^). I cht^ the 1989 
HoG^on-Mifllin basal reading program, ykkh is noted for using trade books as the basis fca* many of 
its stones (Durr, l^a; 198S^), and the EcowMny basal i»ogram, v^uch is based on a skills ai^roach 
to reading instruction (Mattconi, Klein. Suchcr, & Welch, 1989a; 1989b). I recorded the ethnic groups 
and races of the main characters in each st(xy and tallied the race of all people in the iUustrations. 

[In^ TaUe 1 about here] 

None of the 20 stories I randomly samf^d from the youi%- and middle-readers selections of the 1989 
Chiklren's Qkmccs list had mm-white main characters. There was also little variety in the ethnic 
rspresenta^ms in iUuttratimis. Only one bod(, a story aboiU rap music, omtained illustrations d 
African-Americans. No other ethnic groups were represented in any of the stories (see Table 1). The 
books on Secretary Bennett's list also did not have characters d cdor. Hs third-grade list included 
many "classics" (which tend to be about whites) and few contemporary publications. (The idea of a 
canon d classic literature needs to be dealt with in thb age d "cultural literacy,' and I will return to this 
!S£L*f later b this report.) Jim Trelease's popular 1989 list ind jded 51 books listed as aj^iropriate for 
the third-grade kvel. Of the 44 bods sSxmi pcopie (as Of^osed to books rfjout animals, space, and 
so forth), the main diaraders and iDu^rMims d pcoph in all «vre predominantly white. 

There were 40 stories in ite 3-1 and 3-2 literature-based readers published by HougJicm-Mifllin. Six 
of these stories Sd not include any illur ^rations of people. Twehte storks mduded mixes of ethnic 
groi^ All d the other stcMies in the program imjuded refmsentatives of a single ethnic group- 
Afncan-Amcrican, Hispanic, Asian-American, or Native American. The stories featuring whiles 
contained rei^esentati^vs d Mnvral culture (Furopean, American, Canadian, Russian). 

The skiDs-based Economy reader included 45 complete stories (9 of which were broken into a number 
of different lessons). The 40 storfcs with human characters contained a higher percentage of white 
characters (67%) than did the stories in the Houghtcm-Miinin series (50%), and the Economy reader 
contained more fdktales and stories from cWferem eras of American history to vaiy the content/type 
of stoiy. 

These findings sug^ that althoi^ basal reading |^<^ram publishers appear to have made a concerted 
effort to include ethnic diversity m their stories, students are not seeing much cultural diversity in the 
trade books they read at school. These fmdings raise a number of issues. I address several of these in 
the next section.

Multiethnic Children's Literatnre: Some Issues 

TIk first issue raised by tins oamkiMbn ocmsenis tte praknimaiNe cd Ewropean-Amerkan auUion 
wriUi^abottt the expenencec^ people of cx^. ^jns(]98> 4rgues that a Eiinq)eaii>Aniericaa author 
win write frrnn aa 'oittsider's- pmat of view while aa author (tf coiw will wrHe firom aa 'inader's* poim 
of view. Tl» differeiice In the per^iedm iiie»» ttere s a (fiCfereiiGe in wfatf the aitthors and haw 
they say it; indeed, in their purpose for wrkng. Shns aignes that Eur(q)ean'Amerkan wrkers tend to 
warn to socialiije and assiinil^e dukhen otto the culture main^ream-to \md^ the mii^rky and 
au^otky cuhures-whiie writm of eck« want to sociaUxe childres into their own cubaies, keeiMng 
d at i i wt i wa b^ween tl» nu^^nky aid mincvky cnl^ares aUve. Wteiher aitthms want to subsume 
difincm oihures wkhin a 'Wmnaf aibore or nialn £ttiMive aq)^ 
the Ikerary ch«ces authors make aboitt what to say and how to say it. 

The second issue raised, particnlarly in l%fat of tl» issue of assimilatioa and oiltural awareness, is that 
ofdearethmdtyiayhi^rations. A numbn- of basab have perfected tl»eihnicaUyoondistinctive child- 
a child who is a mix <tf numertMs races at ethnic grraps r^ter than canyii^ the di^incthv features of 
any OTe radal group~f(»> their iUustnttiras. In my ai^lystt of basal readers, I found that tlie chUdren 
in some of the iOustra^ms were 'untrace' chiMren, as if the publishers were attemfHii^ to depict all 
peoi^ of €akx without addressii^ dstinguishing differences. 

The third issi» is hypersensitivity. It seems impcmant to engender sensitivity to other cultures without 
losii^ cultural richness that aikis autlM»iticity. A desire to avoid stereotyping can become an excuse to 
not deal with multiethnic literature~iK> book will be "pure" enough. Hypersensitivity can also lead to 
"waierii^ down" or removing any cuhural traits in Iheraiure which, in the end, seems to result in 
devaliuflg cultural diYersiiy mher than vahiii^ ami celelMrating it 

This issue came to the fore most powerfiiUy in an uadergracfaiate children's literature dass I teach when 
I shared Jeaneite Caines'/iisf Vs Womm (1^) w^ my students. This is a bocrft I enjoy because of 
thewarmreJati<mshipitctepictsbm«enagiriandterAumMarthawhoare9»ngona^^ Thedass 
(which happened to be composed entirely ai European^American students) unanimously decided that 
this was not an approi^te boc^ to use because Aunt Martha packed fried chicken for lunch and the 
girl wcHe her hair m braids. The stu&nts had missed tte diance to vicariously experience a wonderful 
trip and a satisfyii^ relationship~a pleasure we could all tdenUfy with and enjoy-because they worried 
about 'he stereotypes assod^edwftheath^ fried chickea ami having bra»ted hair. My undngraduate 
students hawe also been waiy abom books that indude dialect in the diak)gue. Although it is 
appropriate to be sensiine to cultural issues and to forego books that do mH deal with ethnidty in a 
tasteful manner, it should also be a{qvcq»iate to enji^ cultural distinctiveness in the books read. 

A fourth is5i» is that of cultural grouping. There ne^ to be conUnued awareness about the tendency 
to make cuhural congkMnerales-'Hopank" meanii^ any Mexican or Cemral American culture, or 
"Asian" meanmg anythmg from Qunese to Japanese to Filipino. These cultures have great dilTercnccs, 
and some authors do a disservice to learning about the cultures by treating them as though they were 
the same. 

A fifth issue, aDuded to earlier, is that of dealing with the canon of chiWren's Uterature. The traditional 
canon, which iadudea white characters, eontexis, and cultures, need not be eliminated, but broadened
