ABSTRACT 

New multicultural anthologies too often end up 
looking suspiciously like the color palate of a paint-by-numbers kit. 
Canonical tokenism is quickly seen as a ruse by minority students and 
teachers who are circumspect and adept at uncovering counterfeits . As 
an alternative to tokenism, one recommendation is to use Patricia 
Bizzell’s "contact zone’’ as a major theme in constructing a year-long 
pedagogical application of legitimizing cultural literature, seeking 
not only to impart a global education to students but also to foster 
cognitive grace by reconstructing Western study to naturally include 
historic participants of color in the loci of chronicled events and 
thereby authenticate their contr ibut i ons . The course gives due weight 
to the study of the mainstream, traditional canon. Entering community 
college students have little grasp of history and hardly any 
knowledge concerning Western thought. Hence, comparative readings and 
discussions involve philos ophy , rel igi on , commercial iza t i on , 
industry, politics, and the revolutionary ethics instrumental in the 
West’s political and economic metamorphosis. In the first portion of 
the course, specific authors include Max Weber, Charles Darwin, 
Frederic Jameson, E. L. Doctorow, Maxine Hong-Kings t on , and John 
Fowles. Having established that ordinate rel at i onshi ps exist, the 
course’s second section examines examples of cultural negotiation and 
authenticat ion. In the third section, the course initiates a study of 
Latino and Native American Folk stories and poems. (TB)

Cultural inclusion in the loci of historical narrative sustains a 
"first-class seat" in mainstream culture, or what I have come to 
term for my freshman writers as "cognitive grace." Conversely, 
cognitive disgrace fosters oppression or exclusion from 
historical narrative, and its corollary seen in the low 
educational success rate of Latino, African, and Native 
Americans. Remembering Socrates, the problem is that their lives 
saem unworthy of living because they remain unexamined. 

The incorporation of multicultural literature in the writing 
classroom presents a perplexing riddle. While our American 
paradigm earnestly seeks critical thought from our students, it 
simultaneously focuses on active learning situations that use 
culturally significant literature to develop critical reading and 
writing skills. But, as an educator with new anthologies in 
hand, I am frustrated by the unauthentic answer to the riddle, 
an ad hoc assembly of authors, too often looking suspiciously 
like the color-palate of a paint -by-numbers kit. This new

canonical tokenism is quickly seen as a ruse by minority students 
and teachers alike who are circumspect and adept at uncovering 
such counterfeits . 

In the February 1994 edition of College English , rhetoric 
and compos it ional ist Patricia Bizzell proposes that a new method 
of incorporating multicultural literature in the English 
classroom may be accomplished through the study of events where 
cultures interact. Borrowing from Mary Louise Pratt, Bizzell 
categorizes these moments as "Contact Zones": instead of asking, 

for example, how to fit Frederick Douglass into an American 
Renaissance course, Bizzell writes that we should ask how to 
reconceive our study so that Douglass is naturally regarded as 
the important writer that he is (Bizzell 1994) . Applied as a 
pedagogy, this focused study circumvents canonical tokenism, 
while offering an authenticating direction for our discipline. 

Counterfeiting authenticity is not foreign to South Texan 
Chicanos like me. As brown-skinned choir boys in grade school, 
we sang a fan-fair of Texican songs, like "Texas, Our Texas," 
designed to inspire a kind of monoculturalism : "We come your 

children true. Proclaiming our allegiance, Our faith. Our love 
for you." (Texas Alma^.ac 1994). Yet, no matter how I or my 
Chicano compadres tried to harmonize our feelings with words l:ke 
these, something remained uncomfortable for us. Despite our own 
authentic, cultural contributions that sprang from names like 
Zavala, Hinojosa, and Gonzalez, we were non the authenticated and 
valued hosts whose White ancestries endorsed "historic

inclusion." We had no connection with Davy Crockett, Jim Bowie 
or Sam Houston. Any connection we thought we had concerned 
another side: history and movies told us so. "Our" was not 
inclusive of us; it was a left handed "invitation" that 
encouraged in many of us Latinos a negative self-image ana an 
internal resentment. Our melting pot is not so thin and soupy as 
many would think; it is big and chunky, embodying raw cultures of 
segregation and poverty. 

There is, then, little question why many Latino students will 
not enjoy the passionate interest in Texican war heros like Sam 
Houston or Jim Bowie. More abstractive and foreign extensions 

Charles Dickens, Dylan Thomas, or Robert Frost are in fact 
literary heroes whose voices do not echo the experiences of the 
Latino, the African, or the Native American. Like Bowie and 
Crockett, they ‘ contrarily embody a dominant culture's 
experiences, reminding many of us of color that we are without 
cognitive grace. As one African-American student once asked me, 
"How can I understand Dylan Thomas when I am not White nor Welsh 
nor male?" It is a question deeply rooted in her need to be 
socially and legitimately recognized- -her need for 
authentication. 

My experiences as an instructor of General Education 
courses, adult literacy programs, reading-writing at a local 
prison, and an English college instructor, and homeschooler have 
made me cognizant about placing carts before horses: sacrificing 
the practice of critical thought for the hardly significant

knowl6dg0 of th© variant/ suksidiary modals usad to fostar it. 

Our Amarican systam of aducation naads to saak raal dialogua from 
all sides involved/ both present and past/ for such exchange not 
only authenticates the teacher's life but that of the student as 
well. When lately/ for example/ my son asked me if I would 
listen to his new CD bearing a name having something to do with 
broken pumpkinS/ I waived him off and said/ "I'll listen later." 
Yet I had faithfully asked him, as part of homeschooling/ to 
listen to the works of Bach/ Beethoven/ and Mozart. He was 
seeking a personal inclusion in the contributory acts of our 
educational moments together/ and I was denying him that right. 

In authenticating the personal as well as individual cultures of 
our students, men and women/ boys and girls, we must seek the 
authentic dialogue of all participants from all sides and coming 
in all guises.' We must place horses before carts. So long as 
the sub j ect -approach is inclusive of the learner, critical 
thinking is a more personal matter, and knowledge needs first be 
personal before becoming integral to the learner. 

Our statistical student profile at Del Mar College is vastly 
(^xfferent from that of most academies. lake, for example, a 
typical Del Mar College student: an impoverished Latina, 27 

vears old, who is a single -parent and the first of her family to 
attend college. Seven out of ten like her begin at developmental 
levels, and given four years, only one in ten will ever graduate. 
She is from the "West Side" of Corpus Christi where neighborhoods 
are addressed as "barrios" or "colonias" - -the initial tie that 






O

extends beyond her family. She is a servics industry employee at 
minimum wage, and college is an embarrassing dream that she is 
likely to quit due to work and children. Hers is a world of 
(^3_ff02f0nt priorities: hand~ to~mouth first; college study only 

when financial windfalls permit. In the internal makings of her 
familial home she has been nurtured with images of defeat; she is 
socially authenticated with freak-show media images of gang- 
affiliation, third world poverty, and recent statistics of 
genetic inferiority. From my years of teaching in South Texas, I 
understand her as a living irony, the epitome of the American 
paradox: "Pull your own self up by your own bootstraps- - 

bootstraps you are not allowed to have." 

My student profile is a living example of Pratt and 
Bizzell's contact zone, one of the many veritable human "arenas" 
where diverse cultures have contended to interpret an hj.storic 
placement. From a sociological perspective, she experiences 
(diffusion, the acquisition of social elements from the dominant 
culture in order to survive. On a psychological level, she knows 
confusion, the state of being that seeks, but is without, 
cognitive grace. This absence of communal grace fosters low-to- 
no self-esteem in native Latino and African-American Texans, 
principally characterized by a personal sense of estrangement and 
ineptitude . 

Hence, it was with the Contact Zone as a major theme that I 
constructed a year-long pedagogical application of legitimizing 
"cultural ■' iterature , " seeking not only to impart a global 



G

education to students of my Contact Zone classes, but to foster 
cognitive grace by reconstructing Western study to naturally 
include historic participants of color in the loci of chronicled 
events and thereby authenticate their contributions. 

Furthermore, student input concerning the ' Tection of the course 
and its particulars was encouraged. It was no accident that our 
readings were socio-political in nature, selected to stretch the 
boundaries of a typical freshman writing curriculum to include 
psychology, sociology, American history, philosophy and religion. 
My first Accommodating Reader began with the somewhat nostalgic 
"The Times They are A' Changing," and in the fall and spring 
semesters of 1994 and 1995, I launched foir freshman rhetoric and 
composition courses with the contact zone as theme. 

Firstly, we cannot ignore the study of the "mainstream, 
traditional. Western "Canon." Entering community college 
students have little grasp of history and hardly any knowledge 
concerning Western thought. Hence, our comparative readings and 
discussions involved philosophy, religion, commercialization, 
industry, politics, and the revolutionary ethics instrumental in 
the West's political and economic metamorphosis. Since contact 
zones pivot on diffusive relationships, initially my concern was 
to model for students an era where such relationships were 



intense; The Industrial Metamorphosis of the 20th Century. I 
provided a review of Western Thought with a special emphasis on 
ordinate relationships based on class, gender, race, ethnicii.y, 
and religious affiliation.

In the first oortion of our semester, we discussed and read 
works hy Max Weber, Charles Darwxn, and Frederic Jameson, S.Li. 
Doctorow, Maxine Hong-Kingston, and John Fowles . We made 
connections with Social Darwinism, Nietzsche, and Marxism. We 
made more extensive connections through Plato, Hobbes, Rousseau, 
Marx and Engels, Studs Terkel, and even Paulo Freire. In a 
sense, my classrooms were working think-tanks of researchers, all 
with separate missions but a singular purpose- -to seek, find, and 
examine Western causal relationships where ever we could find 
them . 

Student essays, initiated from such rich assemblies, went 
beyond simple, canonical explication. And however laden with 
errors of grammar and logic, contact zone papers read with depth 
and passion that comes from authentic, academic discovery. The 
titles of their essays went beyond what I normally see in 
composition classes: "An explication On Nietzsche s Critical 

Statement that God is Dead"; "A Comparative Analysis of Modern 
and Post-Modern Architecture"; and, "A Description of Natural Law 
Concerning Moral Values With Help From Rousseau and Hobbes . 

Hilda Sanchez, a 52 year-old Latina woman in m* course 
expressed in one essay that her own plight was similar to that of 
Maxine Hong-Kingston. From her abstract: 

Throughout history, culture has served as a medium for the 
representation of feminine mystique. It is still very 
difficult to explain the mystery of woman as a separate 
self. The need for a woman to grow is no different than 



O

that of a man, yet the oppression that ensues reveals a 
limited image of womanhood. The actual basis for this 
"difference" is the fact that the possibility for a true 
self-realization has not existed until now. 

Having established that ordinate relationships exist, we 
began the second portion of our semester exchanging examples of 
cultural negotiation and authentication. The Americas have 
always been a cluster of divergent cultures grappling for 
domination, so culturally significant people in literature and 
art are easily found. Historic, cultural figures like 
Pocohantas, Sacajawea, and Marina (Mexican spouse of conquistador 
Hernando Cortez) were discussed. Dialogue and essays became 
pleasingly analytical when we initiated our study with two 18th 
century Viceregal paintings by Miguel Cabera and Jose Joaquin 
Magon over their "Depictions of Racial Mixtures" (San Antonio 
Express - News 1991) . Here we were debating authenticity as 
provided through social and political media. In Magon' s 
painting, for example, is inscribed, "Spanish father and Mestiza 
mother produce a Quadroon daughter." In the foreground of the 
painting there is a round table between a European husband and 
his Mestiza wife holding their child: "... the three figures 

necessary for the representation of 'mestizaje' [mixed family]" 
(1991) . From an essay by one student Mark Bueno, he writes: 

Magon purposely divides his painting to show how husband and 
wife are f om different cultures. On the left hand side 
...the man is surrounded by paper, pen, and ink indicating 



O 



9 



9 



that he was raised to be educated. . . . On the other side, 
the woman is surrounded with food, flowers, and pottery 
showing that she was raised in a culture that demands her to 
be home .... 

Students like Bueno were fascinated by slides representing 
culture interchange. Dialogue not only indicated that they had 
identified the divergent cultures of the sexes and their social 
auj^hent i ca t ion , but of men and women from separate geographic 
2f0a^liti0s and the subjectivity of the artist instilling the 
images. Dialogue and essay writing went beyond symbolism; we 
discussed the socio-psychological factors behind such historic 
artifacts. Some other students, like Jessica Bates, even pulled 
the boundaries back home into a more personal arena. From Bates' 
essay, "Women, A Subordinate Culture to Men," she writes: 

The subordination of women starts at an early age with girls 
being taught that their role is to be a wife and mother. 

This type of socialization is described in the poem "Barbie 
Doll" by Marge Piercy . . . This type of parenting was 
acceptable many years ago, but times are changing and girls 
need to be taught the skills they will need to survive in 
today ' s world . 

Thirdly, we initiated a study of Latino and Native American 
Folk stories and poems. Contact zone pedagogy, of natural 
course, includes a plethora of cultural themes, imagery, symbols, 
irony -- all the elements needed for literature analysis. I used 
Robert Frost's "Birches” and Jose Limon's "Frost in the Rio 



10 



10 



Grande Valley" to teach students that dominant images have a 
greater meaning than our initial perception (Trevino 1977) . From 
Robert Frost's "Birches": 

When I see birches bend to left and right 
Across the lines of straighter darker trees, 

I like to thinK some boy's been bending them. 

Most South Texans have never have seen a birch tree, much less an 
ice storm; although, it is doubtful that many New Englanders have 
swung from thorny mesquites or tasted the smoky sweetness of its 
sticky sap. 

In "Birches," the narrator negotiates from within. He day- 
dreams, crosses reality with fantasy, but truth asserts its 
claims at the expense of his fancy (Hart 1982) . Though the 
narrator likes to think that "boys been swinging them, " he knows 
that "ice storrtis do" that (Frost 1972). Over Frost's poem, 
definitions and explanations were anxiously fostered from my 
students, but they were all naturally adept at uncovering the 
symbolism, word puns, and irony built into Limon's poem: 

When I see mesquites bend to left and right 
Across the line of a straighter, darker river, 

I'd like to think some boy's been swinging them. 

But swinging doesn't bend them down to stay. 

Only my ancestors did that. 

Hanging, 

Slowly 
at mid-day.

In the glare of the suns of Texas. (Limon 1977 ) 

Limon' s piece symbolizes "the harsh historical fact that 
numerous innocent Mexican-Americans were lynched in the Texas 
Valley, particularly during the early 1900s" (Trevino 1977) . 
Mesquites, are large and thorny at the banks of Soutn Texan 
rivers, and Limon, like Frost, likes to dream of them as bent by 
"boy's. . .swinging them, " there is, however, the harsher reality. 
In this same vein but over the authenticity of the vaquero or 
cowboy, Richard Mondragon in his final examination wrote: 

The original American cowboy originated from the Mexicans' 
traditions .... Cowboy came from the word Vaquero ... That ' s 
why the teaching, learning, and understanding of Bizzell's 
contact zone is essential to authenticating one's culture, 
to establish history as it truly is. . . . 

Cultural names and local folkstories were used as thematic 
study. One good example was La Llorana (Yo-rona) or Weeping Lady 
who according to legend drowned her children because her European 
husband tried to take them. Remarkably, two other versions of 
the legend were offered by my students: Llorona drowns her 

children because her lover does not want them is one, while in 
another, Llorona drowns them because her spouse loved them more 
than her. Thus, for students and teacher alike, the legend was 
enriched and deepened by the intrinsic sense of Freierean 
"dialogue" at the heart of my method. 

Add to Llorona the conquistador Hernando Cortez and his 
f^ 0 xican interpreter Dona Marina whose connections with Llorona 

12 



o

a]f0 d00ply tn0 1 3pho]r i c cl 1 . Lloirons is th0 rnythicsl p0]rsonif icstion 
of Dona Marina, tha Aztec woman who is despicably called by many 
Latinos "La Malinche" -- the treacherous one -- because she acted 
as an interpreter and guide for Cortez' conquest of Mexico. Like 
Llorona, Dona Marina marries the European Cortez; there are 
children. Hence, Marina's place is one of lo'^'^e, yet betrayal to 
her people. She is the mystical mother of Hispanics who is also 
the murderer of a culture. 

Contact zone studies of South Texas are a rich, resource for 
multicultural literature. We discuss, as in any other mono- 
cultural literature course, contextual, personal and cultural 
interpretations of literature. I know that my students have 
gained a wide range of connective knowledge. Recently, a student 
of mine suggested elemental items for a study that examines Gay 
culture and thd contact zone there in. As modern literature that 
exploration seems tempting. 

The question my homeschooled son asked me some time ago still 
bothers me like a Bosch painting; "Who determines what is written 
as history?" he asked. "Those in power," I answered. However 
far learning extends, initial and critical studies in composition 
need to stretch the current boundaries so that we are sure to 
justly authenticate the many voices of our world, and by that 
establish lives worth living, asserting the right to be 
cognatively graced w.ith inclusion. Such inclusion needs to be 
carefully deliberated and planned, not with only some in mind, 
but many in participation. I do not purport that my method here 




13

offers the only way- -but one based in personal knowledge. 
Canonical tokenism, however, needs to be avoided, for no culture 
likes to feel like an unwelcome guest in its own home.
