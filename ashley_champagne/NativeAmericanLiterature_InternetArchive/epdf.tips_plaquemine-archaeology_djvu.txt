Preface 


I wish I could be sure when I first encountered the term Plaquemine, but it 
cannot be less than 50 years ago. Probably it occurred when I was in Ann 
Arbor in 1949—1950 with Jimmy Griffin, although I trust that my earlier Yale 
mentor, Ben Rouse, could not have been ignorant of it either, due to his amaz¬ 
ingly broad knowledge of world archaeology and his having been the editor 
of American Antiquity. In the text herein, I am cited as using the term in a 
1956 article! Wow, how little one remembers of one’s own past. 

However, we Lower Valley scholars must not be too brazen in our knowl¬ 
edge and usage. I am sure that we cannot make Plaquemine a broadly known 
term in the eastern United States or even in the southeastern corner of our 
nation. But we can take heart from other quite well-known terminology and 
realize that every area in American archaeology has its own best-known 
words: “Clovis and Pecos” for New Mexico, “Cahokia” for Illinois, “Hope- 
wellian” for Ohio, and so on. So why not “Plaquemine,” then, for a culture 
in the southern part of the Lower Mississippi Valley, named for a town in 
Louisiana? 

Of course, I do support large overviews from the elders. My own introduc¬ 
tion to the Lower Mississippi Valley began even before Ann Arbor in the 
1950 s; it actually began with a December 1948 visit to the Sandy Woods site 
in southeast Missouri with my father and my twin brother, Philip. I had been 
working in the Yale Peabody Museum on an archaeological collection from 
that site for my Senior Honors paper. I grew up—one through five years—on 
the very banks of the Mississippi River in Minneapolis. 

But enough of the past. From southeast Missouri the whole Lower Missis¬ 
sippi Valley lay ahead for me: Nodena in northeast Arkansas, the Lake George 
site in the Yazoo Basin, and also much farther south still with the Lower Mis-

sissippi Survey through Louisiana, only ending at Avery Island on the Gulf of 
Mexico. The Lower Mississippi Survey from the Harvard Peabody Museum 
has been there and done that, starting with Phil Phillips’s work in the late 
1930 s. 

So back to Plaquemine: this volume provides a very good coverage on the 
topic, and there is not too much more that I can add. When the readers finish 
this lengthy discussion on Plaquemine I think they will have learned quite a 
lot of useful information on this perennially discussed topic.

Introduction and Historical Overview 

Mark A. Rees and Patrick C. Livingood 


The town of Plaquemine, Louisiana, seems an unassuming southern commu¬ 
nity for which to designate an entire culture. Of course names can be mis¬ 
leading and Plaquemine is no exception. Like Mississippian culture of south¬ 
eastern North America, of which Plaquemine has been described as a regional 
focus or variant (Griffin 1946, 1967), Plaquemine was devised by archaeolo¬ 
gists to describe the material remains and sites of pre-Columbian and proto- 
historic Native American societies for which there exists little or no written 
documentation. Its geographic position has been associated with the Lower 
Mississippi Valley (LMV), extending from the Mississippi delta on the Gulf 
coast to just south of the Arkansas River (Jeter and Williams 1989:207-208; 
cf. Neuman 1984:259). This area spans the southern Yazoo Basin and Natchez 
Bluffs on the east and the lower Ouachita and Red river valleys on the west, 
encompassing a diverse range of valley topography and environments (Figure 
1.1) (Autin et al. 1991; Kidder 200413:545; Saucier 1994). 

So what’s the problem or, rather, what are the problems with Plaquemine? 
Like the town for which it was named, it has seemed at times on the verge of 
washing into the Mississippi River (Riffel 1985:38—41). Unlike its more well- 
known and extroverted Mississippian cousin, Plaquemine seems to have been 
fraught with difficulties since early on. No sooner had the concept been de¬ 
fined than the exigencies of archaeological research required that it be decon¬ 
structed and redefined (Phillips 1970:950). Alternating descriptions of diag¬ 
nostic pottery types, earthen mounds, and architecture in different regions 
have produced the appearance of an imprecise or “nebulous” tradition (Brown 
198513:252; Jeter and Williams 1989:205). Yet Plaquemine is today still regarded 
as a distinct cultural tradition on the frontier of the Mississippian world, with 
ties to both earlier Coles Creek and contemporaneous Mississippian tradi-

tions, beginning in the second or third century of the Mississippi period (ca. 
A.D. IOOO-17OO). 

As advances in research continue to make contributions to our understand¬ 
ing of the archaeology of the LMV, it is apropos to reconsider the concept of 
Plaquemine culture. An attempt has been made in this volume to draw to¬ 
gether recent studies that call attention to variability as well as uniformity, 
including views from such disparate environments as the Mississippi River 
floodplain, the Tensas Basin, the Natchez Bluffs, and the “northerly border¬ 
lands” of southeastern Arkansas. Even so, much variability in the archaeologi¬ 
cal record has yet to be adequately investigated. There is little doubt that 
Plaquemine will continue to serve on one level as a valuable heuristic in ex¬ 
amining and making sense of that variability. This chapter examines the ori¬ 
gins and definitions of Plaquemine, summarizes some of the history and 
themes of Plaquemine archaeology, and introduces some ongoing problems 
and directions for future research. 

Historical Genesis and Adjustments 

Plaquemine first appeared in print in James Ford and Gordon Willey’s classic 
1941 synthesis of eastern United States prehistory, although without further 
consideration in the text. Plaquemine was shown to be intermediate to the 
preceding Coles Creek period and subsequent Natchez and Bayou Goula cul¬ 
tures. The embryonic nature of the concept is illustrated in the atypical spell¬ 
ing (“Placquemine”) in two chronological profiles (Ford and Willey i94i:Fig- 
ures 2 and 6). Ford and Willey (1941:359) also cited the Bayou Goula report 
as “in preparation” by Quimby. “Placquemine” was portrayed by Ford and 
Willey (1941:328, 330) as transitional between the Temple Mound I and II 
stages along the north-south axis of eastern North American cultures and 
associated with the Temple Mound II stage in the east-west axis. The Temple 
Mound stage terminology was eventually superseded by the Mississippi pe¬ 
riod and Plaquemine would come to be defined by way of contrast (Griffin 
1946, 1967; Williams 1956; cf. Willey 1966:292-304). 

The origins of Plaquemine can ultimately be traced to a series of distinc¬ 
tions made during the first half of the twentieth century, distinctions that at 
least initially had little to do with Plaquemine. Surveying the geographic dis¬ 
tributions of Native American pottery in the eastern United States a century 
ago, William Henry Holmes (1903:21) predicted that the groups of pottery he 
laid out contained sufficient internal variability to eventually warrant further 
subdivision (see also Moore 1913). Holmes (1886, 1903) was instrumental in 
the creation of the Mississippian concept via his “Middle Mississippi Valley

group,” which by mid-century had become firmly established as the late pre- 
Columbian and protohistoric period in the Southeast, as well as a precocious 
and expansive culture subsequently thought to have emanated from the Cen¬ 
tral Mississippi Valley (Dejarnette and Wimberly 1941:99-110; Griffin 1943:257, 
1946,1952; Phillips et al. 1951; Williams 1956; see Griffin 1985 for an overview). 
Holmes (1903:21) suggested that ceramic traditions do not inevitably coincide 
with ethnicity or culture, nor are they always a reliable measure of cultural 
complexity (i.e., “important groups” versus “insignificant communities”). He 
described the geographic distribution, function, stylistic variation, and tem¬ 
per of pottery in the Mississippi Valley, including the physical properties of 
shell temper and general similarities between Lower and Middle Mississippi 
wares (Holmes 1903:20-80, 101-104). Mississippian culture and the Missis¬ 
sippi period were derived from this and subsequent works in the context of an 
emergent culture historical archaeology in the Southeast (Griffin 1985:44-57). 

Plaquemine was developed by James Ford and George Quimby based on 
the results of WPA work conducted between 1938 and 1941 under the auspices 
of the Louisiana State Archaeological Survey. It represented a refinement of 
Ford’s (1935a, 1936, 1938) earlier chronology of ceramic-producing cultures in 
the LMV: Marksville, Coles Creek, and Natchez (Quimby 1942:256,1951:87). 
In an article completed the same year Ford and Willeys overview was publish¬ 
ed (1941), Quimby (1942:256) defined Plaquemine as a “culture which pre¬ 
ceded the Natchezan type.” Like Mississippian, Plaquemine had its roots in 
more fundamental pottery typologies and their chronological classification. 
More than any other culture trait, pottery types were seen as central in 
distinguishing Natchez from contemporaneous and earlier cultures. Among 
the types initially regarded by Quimby (1942:265-268) as characteristic of a 
“Plaquemine period” were Addis Plain (Baytown Plain, var. Addis), Manchac 
Incised (Mazique Incised, var. Manchac), Hardy Incised (Coles Creek Incised, 
var Hardy), Plaquemine Brushed, Pocahontas Plain (Mississippi Plain, var. 
Pocahontas), and Pocahontas Punctated, the latter two types subsequently as¬ 
sociated more strictly with the Natchez Bluffs (e.g., Neitzel 1983:95). 

Coles Creek was in effect split into thirds: Troyville, Coles Creek proper, 
and Plaquemine. Plaquemine was also envisioned as a spatially intermediate 
pottery complex, wedged between Caddo sites on the west and various Mis¬ 
sissippian complexes farther north and east (Ford and Willey 1941:328, 330). 
In this sense, Plaquemine was initially conceptualized as “a logical correction 
for the hasty 1940 overextension of the Caddoan concept, rather than an out¬ 
growth of it” (Jeter and Williams 1989:205; cf. Phillips 1970:946). Plaquemine 
thus came into being as a somewhat vague designation for post-Coles Creek,

pre-Natchez, non-Caddo, and non-Mississippian pottery assemblages in the 
Lower Valley (Brown 198513:252; Jeter and Williams 1989:205; Quimby 1942:256). 
Plaquemine consequently received the dubious distinction early on of being 
“defined more in terms of what it lacks than in what it possesses” (Jennings 
1952:267). 

Archaeological understanding of Plaquemine components and assemblages 
advanced slowly during the ensuing decades, despite the fact that it was never 
“adequately defined” as a culture (Williams and Brain 1983:373). As it turns 
out, 1951 was a seminal year for publications on Plaquemine as well as Missis- 
sippian archaeology (e.g., Cotter 1951a; Ford 1951; Phillips et al. 1951; Quimby 
1951). Sites such as Greenhouse, Medora, Emerald, and Anna yielded a wealth 
of information with which to flesh out the concept of Plaquemine culture. 
With the addition of publications by Cotter (1952a) and Quimby (1957) on 
the Gordon and Bayou Goula sites, these works made up until the early 1970s, 
according to Phillips (1970:950), the “basic documentation for the Plaque¬ 
mine culture period” (see also Belmont 1967; Bohannon 1963; Brain 1969; 
Hally 1967; Neitzel 1965). The rapid appearance of these groundbreaking 
publications, delayed by World War II, provided the impetus for examin¬ 
ing internal variability in respect to pottery types and the redefinition of 
Plaquemine-related phases (Phillips 1970:950). Ironically, it would also influ¬ 
ence consideration of similarities between regional variants of Plaquemine 
culture and Coles Creek, Mississippian, Natchez, and Caddo cultures, or pre¬ 
cisely what had made it necessary to differentiate Plaquemine in the first place 
(e.g., Brain 1978; Brown 1985a, 1985b; Gregory 1969; Hally 1972; Neitzel 1965, 
1983; Steponaitis 1981; Webb 1959, 1961). 

Quimby’s (1951) Medora site report is generally cited as establishing the 
formal, archaeological criteria for both Plaquemine culture and a Plaquemine 
period (e.g., Ford 1952:327; Jeter and Williams 1989:206; Phillips 1970:950). 
Quimby argued that specific ceramic types such as Addis Plain (Baytown 
Plain, var. Addis), Plaquemine Brushed, L’Eau Noire Incised, Manchac In¬ 
cised (Mazique Incised, var. Manchac), Hardy Incised (Coles Creek Incised, 
var Hardy), and others are integral to the definition of the Plaquemine con¬ 
cept. Certain ceramic vessel forms such as plates with interior incising and jars 
with brushed decoration remain key Plaquemine indicators. Because the re¬ 
port was based on excavation and not just surface collections, he was also able 
to suggest other traits that characterize Plaquemine (Quimby 1951:128). Some 
of these, such as the presence of truncated, pyramidal mounds around a plaza 
and post construction with and without wall trenches, have generally held up 


over time.

REES AND LIVINGOOD 


Like most chronologies proposed before radiocarbon dating was available, 
the original dates for Plaquemine turned out to be too short and too recent. 
Originally thought to date not much earlier than a.d. 1400-1500 (Ford and 
Willey 1941:328, 330; Quimby 1951:130, 1957), it is now commonly considered 
to date from at least a.d. 1200. Phillips, Ford, and Griffin (1951:454, Table 17) 
suggested as much in the conclusion of their monumental Archaeological Sur¬ 
vey in the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley, based on the correlation of sites 
with Mississippi River channel chronology. Plaquemine was preceded accord¬ 
ing to some by a Coles Creek transition (a.d. 1000-1200; Jeter and Williams 
1989:172; Weinstein and Kelley 1992:31, 38). Medora, the type site for Plaque¬ 
mine culture, in fact appears to date in large part from this transitional era 
(Brown 198513:256; Weinstein i987a:87-9o). Plaquemine culture is now also 
usually placed within the Mississippi period (rather than Quimby’s Plaque¬ 
mine period), reflecting the greater influence of Mississippian culture and 
Mississippian archaeology (Brown 1998c). 

Plaquemine Origins Reconsidered 

There remain substantial differences of opinion concerning Plaquemine cul¬ 
tural origins, particularly in relation to preceding Coles Creek and contempo¬ 
raneous Mississippian traditions. At the risk of oversimplifying the present 
state of affairs, three lines of argument generally characterize these differences. 
The first is represented in the formative works of Ford (1951), Quimby (1942, 
1951,1957), and Phillips (1970) and is referred to here as “neither Mississippian 
nor Coles Creek.” In contrast, the second has been described as “Mississip- 
pianized Coles Creek” (Brain 1978:344-345; Brown 198513:253; Williams and 
Brain 1983), while a third approach represents a middle ground of sorts and 
might be characterized as endogenous development or “continuity and change” 
(Kidder 199813:131, this volume). Although there is certainly room for compro¬ 
mise (e.g., Kelley et al. 2000:17-18; Weinstein 19873:87), we use these distinc¬ 
tions here as a means of highlighting the diversity of Plaquemine through 
time and space. 

Neither Mississippian nor Coles Creek 

Phillips (1970) both emphasized the position of Plaquemine as a culture and 
redefined the culture in terms of specific phases. This allowed him to talk 
about the Mississippi period throughout the LMV but to distinguish between 
Plaquemine and Mississippian cultures. Phillips refined and codified the type- 
variety system used for classifying ceramics in the Lower Valley. One of the 
hallmarks of this system is that it is hierarchical; it calls for investing more

importance in certain distinctions by using them as the criteria to separate 
types, and it calls for subsuming other, presumably more minor differences 
under the divisions between varieties (e.g., Brown 1998b). The presence or 
absence of shell tempering was recognized as one of the first-order distinctions 
used in the descriptions of types. Since Phillips used ceramic evidence as the 
primary criteria for making cultural distinctions, the absence or presence of 
shell tempering became the axiomatic means for separating Plaquemine from 
Mississippian (Kidder 1998^131; Williams and Brain 1983:337, 340). 

The definition of Plaquemine we inherit from Phillips (1970:30, 34) thus 
hinges almost entirely on ceramics. He stipulated that Plaquemine is defined 
by a cluster of ceramic types and forms, the absence of significant shell tem¬ 
pering being the most important characteristic that ties these complexes to¬ 
gether. Plaquemine is distinguished by “long-standing typological criteria” 
developed out of Phillips, Ford, and Griffin’s (1951) earlier Archaeological Sur¬ 
vey in the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley (Phillips 1970:923). Phases as well 
as cultures were distinguished on the basis of ceramics, according to Phillips 
(1970:9) representing “discontinuities of a minor order that are no less inher¬ 
ent in the material.” 

Phases were consequently emphasized as the central mechanism for under¬ 
standing cultural dynamics, as embodied in regional designations such as Me- 
dora, Crippen Point, and Fitzhugh (Phillips 1970:558-560, 945, 950-951; cf. 
Phillips and Willey 1953). Phillips (1970:950-951) thus commented on the 
phase-based “dismemberment” of Plaquemine culture as a necessary analyti¬ 
cal exercise, excising all except those phases that maintained Plaquemine as a 
cohesive and unadulterated complex. Of course, one result of this approach 
was to emphasize the need to determine whether a particular phase was either 
Plaquemine or Mississippian (Jeter and Williams 1989:212). On a broader 
scale, Phillips (1970:13) described Mississippian influence in the Lower Yazoo 
Basin in terms of intrinsic cultural movements, falling somewhere between 
diffusion and invasion. He referred to the ability of Plaquemine culture bear¬ 
ers to repel, at least for a time, the seemingly indomitable Mississippian drive 
southward (“ Drang nach Stiden”; Phillips 1970:954), what a later generation 
of archaeologists would critique as the “Mississippian expansion” (i.e., Smith 
1984). 

The idea of Plaquemine as neither Mississippian nor Coles Creek was thus 
integral to its origin as an archaeological culture, pottery complex, culture 
period, and phase. Ford (1951:85-89) found only minor evidence for an early 
Plaquemine component at Greenhouse, a major Coles Creek mound site in 
central Louisiana. Similarities between Plaquemine and Coles Creek were 



REES AND LIVINGOOD 


seen as strongest in this area and to the south, both in terms of pottery types 
and the continued use of burial mounds (e.g., Jennings 1952:267; Rees, this 
volume). In contrast, similarities between Plaquemine and Mississippian were 
more readily apparent to the north, particularly at sites with large platform 
mounds. Yet perceptions of difference and similarity had actually provided 
little explanation for Plaquemine cultural origins. Near the end of his Yazoo 
Basin report, Phillips (1970:967-968) amended an earlier suggestion that 
Plaquemine architecture and settlement patterns in the Yazoo Basin appeared 
to represent the “Mississippianization” of Plaquemine culture, arguing instead 
that “the hypothesis can only be tested by thorough excavation.” 

Mississippianized Coles Creek 

Following Phillips’s prescient advice, Stephen Williams and Jeffrey Brain re¬ 
formulated and advanced the concept of Plaquemine in several key ways from 
the vantage point of the Lower Yazoo Basin (Brain 1978,1989,1991; Williams 
and Brain 1983). They produced the most coherent and far-reaching interpre¬ 
tation of Plaquemine cultural origins and development by arguing that Plaque¬ 
mine could be best viewed as “a hybridization of Coles Creek and Mississip¬ 
pian cultures” (Williams and Brain 1983:338). On the basis of the results of 
investigations at Lake George and Winterville, they argued that during the 
Coles Creek period LMV residents, especially in frontier zones, began to 
adopt new technologies with Mississippian origins, such as shell tempering, 
the Mississippian jar, and wall-trench houses (Brain 1969,1989:114-120; Wil¬ 
liams and Brain 1983:408-414). This was followed by the encroachment of 
small numbers of Mississippian communities into the northern part of the 
Yazoo Basin, at sites such as Buford. By a.d. 1200 direct person-to-person 
contacts were occurring between major Mississippian settlements to the north 
and major sites in the Lower Valley. Between a.d. 1300 and 1400 sites in 
the Lower Yazoo began to be acculturated to the Mississippian pattern and 
more closely resembled sites farther north (Brain 1989:125, 128). As a result, a 
Mississippian/Plaquemine frontier formed and moved south. Prior to a.d. 1300 
it was somewhere north of Greenville, Mississippi, but by a.d. 1400-1500 the 
frontier had moved to the vicinity of Vicksburg. Plaquemine was conse¬ 
quently defined as the Mississippianization of Coles Creek culture, a concept 
that has more recendy undergone historical-processual revision (Brain 1989:122; 
e.g., Pauketat 2002, 2004). 

Williams and Brain further amended the definition of Plaquemine by re¬ 
classifying the Crippen Point phase as terminal Coles Creek instead of early

Plaquemine, thus moving the Coles Creek-Plaquemine transition from about 
a.d. iooo to a.d. 1200. Phillips (1970:558-560) had originally classified Crip- 
pen Point as Plaquemine because it was associated with the appearance of 
Addis-paste ceramics. However, Williams and Brain (1983:318) argued that 
Crippen Point ceramics continued to exhibit linear decorative techniques fo¬ 
cused on the vessel rim, like most previous Coles Creek forms. Beyond ceram¬ 
ics, they pointed out that the Lake George site underwent only small, gradual 
changes during the Crippen Point phase, placing it more comfortably within 
the preceding Coles Creek period. 

As Jeter and Williams (1989:208-209) indicate, the reformulation of the 
Coles Creek-Plaquemine transition has far-reaching consequences for how 
we characterize the late prehistory of the Lower Valley. If the Crippen Point 
phase is categorized as Coles Creek, then Williams and Brain (1983:405) are 
correct in describing Coles Creek as a relatively conservative period followed 
by dramatic changes, including the abrupt adoption of Mississippian tech¬ 
nologies. Plaquemine is in effect the culmination of Mississippian cultural 
influences upon conservative Coles Creek societies. Alternatively, if the Crip¬ 
pen Point phase is categorized as Plaquemine, then the origins of Plaque¬ 
mine culture predate major Mississippian influence and changes appear more 
gradual. 

Outside the Lower Yazoo Basin, researchers have faced related difficulties 
in classifying phases according to broader cultural categories. For example, 
there have been disagreements over whether to classify the Bayou Petre phase 
in the Mississippi delta as either Mississippian or Plaquemine (Brown 198513:283; 
Phillips 1970:951-953; Weinstein i987a:98). Differences of opinion have also 
arisen regarding the Preston phase in the Tensas Basin and whether or not to 
classify it as Coles Creek (Hally 1972:605-607; Jeter and Williams 1989:210- 
212; Wells and Weinstein 2005). Such decisions ultimately transcend differ¬ 
ences regarding which period or culture a certain phase should be associated 
and strike at the heart of how we conceive of Plaquemine. Faced with the 
ambiguities of drawing an exact boundary between Coles Creek and Plaque¬ 
mine where none appears to exist, some scholars have instead advocated using 
“transitional Coles Creek-Plaquemine” to refer to intermediate phases such 
as Crippen Point, Gordon, Preston, and St. Gabriel (Belmont 1982a; Belmont 
and Williams 1981; Brown 1985b; Jeter and Williams 1989; Weinstein 1987a; 
Wells and Weinstein, this volume). In doing so, the question of Plaquemine 
origins is effectively rephrased as a problem of understanding continuity and 
change.

Continuity and Change 

An alternative approach to Plaquemine origins is to describe it as an endo¬ 
genous cultural tradition or outgrowth of preceding Coles Creek culture, with 
no less significant exogenous influences (Haag 1965:304-307,1978,1988; Hally 
1972; Kidder 1998b; Neuman 1984:258; Sibley 1967:157). From this perspec¬ 
tive, interpretations of Plaquemine culture as “Mississippianized Coles Creek” 
rely too heavily on the Lower Yazoo data and do not generalize well to other 
regions such as the Lower Ouachita, Tensas Basin, or Natchez Bluffs (Kidder 
i998b:i3i). In fact, there is little evidence from Plaquemine components in 
areas far removed from the Lower Yazoo Basin for direct contacts or similar 
wide-ranging Mississippian influence (e.g., Quimby 1951; Rees 2003, this vol¬ 
ume). Despite the fact that communities in regions closer to the Lower Yazoo 
Basin adopted similar site plans and ceramic forms, it seems unrealistic to 
consider all Plaquemine components throughout the LMV as Mississippian¬ 
ized Coles Creek (Brown 1985b; Hally 1972). 

When Mississippian contacts have been identified in other regions it has 
been in juxtaposition with a clear progression from Coles Creek to Plaque¬ 
mine traditions (Brown 1999; Davis and Giardino 1980; Weinstein 1987a, 
1987b; Weinstein and Kelley 1984; Wells and Weinstein, this volume). For 
example, Mississippian influences from the Mobile Bay region via the Bayou 
Petre phase have been identified for a coastal Plaquemine variant represented 
in the Barataria and Burk Hill phases (Brown 1985b; Brown et al. 1979; Davis 
1984; Jeter and Williams 1989:218-220; Shuman, this volume; Weinstein 
1987a). It should come as no surprise, then, that Caddo influence has likewise 
been discerned for Plaquemine phases on the western “frontier” (Jeter and 
Williams 1989:213; Rolingson 1976). Similarities between Caddo and Plaque¬ 
mine ceramic assemblages were recognized early on by Griffin (1946:83), Krie- 
ger (1946:253, 255), and Webb (1959:148,150,153, 202, 206), supposedly based 
on a common Coles Creek derivation (see also Sibley 1967:157-164). Despite 
differences of opinion, many archaeologists now recognize clear continuities 
between Coles Creek and Plaquemine traditions (Brown 1984:115, 118; Kelley 
1984:43; Miller et al. 2000:47; Ryan, ed. 2004:23-24; Weinstein 19873:87; 
Wells 2001:16). 

Regarding the “typological criteria” set forth by Phillips (1970:923), David 
Hally (1972) has suggested that archaeologists may be placing too much im¬ 
portance on the appearance of shell tempering. T. R. Kidder (199813:132) has 
likewise suggested that an emphasis on shell tempering might be creating an 
“artificial dichotomy between Mississippian and Plaquemine cultures and

gloss over some obvious similarities” (see also Kidder 2004^555). The appear¬ 
ance of shell tempering was likely a much more complex and varied phenome¬ 
non (Shuman, this volume). Shell tempering was adopted at some sites in 
the Tensas Basin, such as Transylvania, much earlier than at nearby sites 
(Hally 1972:423-426). At sites like Transylvania, where both Addis and shell- 
tempered pastes were used, the majority of decorated forms were placed on 
shell-tempered ware while the majority of plain sherds were Addis (Hally 
1972). At sites such as Pevey on the Pearl River, however, the opposite condi¬ 
tion is true (Livingood 1999, this volume). Furthermore, several decorative 
techniques seem to have been exclusively reserved for Addis paste, while others 
were more likely to be executed on shell-tempered vessels or vessels containing 
shell in an otherwise Addis paste (Hally 1972:426-430; Kidder 1998^132). 

Until some of these complex relationships are addressed, it is difficult to 
fathom the precise meaning of the adoption of shell tempering. Whether it is 
regarded as an unambiguous technological innovation or part of a foreign 
cultural package, it would have involved the negotiation of new social mean¬ 
ings on a local level (Nassaney 2001:168-169; Pauketat 200ib:82). Investigat¬ 
ing Plaquemine components in terms of both continuity and change is to 
allow for historical connections with Coles Creek, Caddoan, Natchezan, and 
Mississippian traditions, while at the same time recognizing essential differ¬ 
ences. Unlike the Mississippianized Coles Creek point of view, this does not 
provide an intrinsic or straightforward explanation of cultural origins. From 
yet another perspective, the question of cultural origins seems misplaced. Fol¬ 
lowing the example of Mississippian archaeology elsewhere in the Southeast, 
Plaquemine might be approached from a regional, political-economic per¬ 
spective (e.g., Anderson 1996b, 1999; Barker and Pauketat, eds. 1992; Hally 
1993; Pauketat 1997a, 1997b). Archaeologists are again confronted with the fa¬ 
miliar challenge of working from the ground up, in hopes of refining present- 
day knowledge of Plaquemine culture, one site and one assemblage at a time. 

Future Directions and the Present Work 

Plaquemine, it seems, despite six decades of research, is still badly in need of 
definition (cf. Jennings 1952:267; Kelley 1984:42; Williams and Brain 1983:373). 
Variability between phases in the Lower Yazoo Basin, Natchez Bluffs, Tensas 
Basin, and Baton Rouge area even now threaten to erode the conceptual foun¬ 
dation laid long ago by James Ford; yet these are the very regions that might 
be construed as a Plaquemine “heartland” (Jeter and Williams 1989:207-212). 
Considerably less is known about the Lower Ouachita Valley or Felsenthal 
region of southeast Arkansas, the Bartholomew-Boeuf Basin, Catahoula Ba-

sin, Lower Red River, Atchafalaya Basin, or Gulf coastal plain. Having de¬ 
fined Plaquemine as a more or less cohesive cultural tradition in contrast to 
other spatially and temporally adjoining traditions, archaeologists are still in 
the process of filling in the details on local and regional levels. 

Part of the problem, of course, is that the term Plaquemine has been so 
broadly applied (Jeter and Williams 1989:205-220). Consideration of a Plaque¬ 
mine “heartland” implies Coles Creek antecedents more or less removed from 
Mississippian stimulus. In contrast, Plaquemine components along the west¬ 
ern margin in the Catahoula Basin, Lower Ouachita, and Felsenthal region 
exhibit affiliations with Caddo traditions (Fuller and Williams 1985; Gibson 
: 983, 1996:69-73; Gregory 1969; Gregory et al. 1987; Kidder 1990a, 1998b; 
Rolingson and Schambach 1981). A coastal Plaquemine culture can likewise 
be distinguished in regard to ceramics, settlement, and subsistence (Brown 
1985b; Jeter and Williams 1989:212-220; Weinstein 1987a). 

Regardless of how we conceive of Plaquemine culture, greater attention to 
regional diversity promises to increase our understanding of those who were 
actively engaged in its production and dissemination (sensu Pauketat 2001a, 
2001b). The intersection of practice theory and historical process has focused 
archaeological research on the political contexts of agency, material culture, 
and traditions (Dobres and Robb 2000:10-13; Pauketat 2000:114-117). At the 
same time, earlier explanatory models will continue to inform the direction 
of research. The presence or absence of shell tempering might be understood 
in this light not only as a technological choice or intrinsic cultural decision 
of potters but also in terms of long-distance contacts, migrations, intermar¬ 
riages, ethnic identity, and resistance—as one facet of a historical process of 
Mississippianization (Livingood, this volume; Pauketat 200ib:8i-83, 2004: 
Hi-Hi)- 

The majority of the debate over Plaquemine origins in the LMV has in 
retrospect been framed in the context of an older, essentialist culture historical 
approach, the same point of view that inspired James Ford to breathe life into 
the concept. Without undermining the culture historical foundation of 
Plaquemine, future research promises to enhance current knowledge in regard 
to historical ecology, subsistence economies, and political dynamics—the ac¬ 
tual practices that produced and made up multiscalar cultural variability. 

Following in the footsteps of Mississippian archaeology, it is fitting that 
our understanding of Plaquemine diversity be more firmly situated within a 
set of generalizations drawn from cultural ecology (e.g., Kottak 1999; Orlove 
1980; Smith 1978). The hurricanes of 2005 that led to the evacuation of New 
Orleans and caused extensive damage to the Gulf Coast region are powerful 
recent reminders that the LMY and Gulf Coast region can be unpredictable 



INTRODUCTION AND HISTORICAL OVERVIEW 


13 


environments with extremely volatile ecological processes (e.g., Saucier 1994: 
321-322). A full understanding of Plaquemine culture must necessarily ac¬ 
count for how people dealt with the abrupt changes and periodic threats of 
dynamic landforms. Hurricane Katrina, in particular, evokes anthropogenic 
factors and serves as a tragic reminder that the Mississippi River has become 
increasingly channelized since the first artificial levees were built in the eigh¬ 
teenth century. Lower Valley residents took advantage of a dynamic riverine 
environment well before Mississippian times by hunting wetland game and 
harvesting fish trapped in oxbow lakes replenished by annual floods. However, 
we have little understanding of how Plaquemine peoples or their progenitors 
coped with exceptional flooding events that on occasion must have affected 
thousands of square miles. 

Human-environmental relationships within any particular “riverine adap¬ 
tation” (or variant thereof) are negotiated in terms of socially and historically 
contingent landscapes (Crumley 1994:6,11; Kidder 1993d; Patterson 1994; cf. 
Smith 1978). Just as recent anthropogenic processes are transforming the 
LMV (Saucier 1994:331-332), archaeologists should not assume indigenous 
populations were merely passive recipients of natural processes. Such regional 
and local-level cultural diversity and divergent historical trajectories defy 
straightforward eco-functionalist or systemic explanation (Anderson 1994b, 
1999; Barker and Pauketat 1992; Cobb 1996; Pauketat 2001b). While it might 
be tempting to attribute such diversity at the macroscale to environmental 
differences, historical documentation hints at profound ethnic and linguistic 
variations within the LMV, distinctions undoubtedly transformed and trans¬ 
fixed by living peoples during the preceding millennium (Galloway 1998, 
2002; Giardino 1984; Jeter 2002a; Kidder 1993b; Swanton 1911). 

One of the most valuable contributions in this regard involves problems of 
subsistence and subsistence economies (Fritz and Kidder 1993; Harmon and 
Rose 1989; Kidder 1992b; Kidder and Fritz 1993; Rose et al. 1984; Rose et al. 
1991). In particular, the adoption of maize agriculture is no longer regarded as 
a causal mechanism in the evolution of Coles Creek social complexity (Kid¬ 
der 1992a). Although maize has been recovered from Plaquemine components 
in the Lower Yazoo, Natchez Bluffs, and Tensas Basin, little is actually known 
about the relative dietary and economic significance of agriculture throughout 
the LMV. Furthermore, it is risky to generalize to other regions where data are 
sparser. The intensification of maize agriculture in the Tensas Basin was asso¬ 
ciated with the terminal Coles Creek-Plaquemine transition, raising addi¬ 
tional questions regarding possible Mississippian contacts, the development of 
social inequalities, and political complexity (Kidder 1992a, 1992b; Kidder and 
Fritz 1993; Roberts 2004). Some Plaquemine groups may have continued in 



H 


REES AND LIVINGOOD 


the Coles Creek tradition of focusing on an abundance of fish, waterfowl, and 
shellfish (Fritz and Kidder 1993; Gregory 1969; Jeter and Williams 1989:215- 
216, 219; Kidder et al. 1993; Miller et al. 2000:435-436; Rolingson and Scham- 
bach 1981; R. Smith 1996), while in some areas white-tailed deer and small 
mammals appear to have been relatively more important (Coxe and Kelley 
2004; Springer 1980; Stevenson 1992). Ffowever tempting further generaliza¬ 
tion may be, it will be advantageous to situate new data on subsistence econo¬ 
mies within the historical context of regional polities. One productive area of 
research will be to examine the evidence for feasting and food provisioning in 
such contexts (e.g., Beasley, this volume; Blitz 1993; Jackson and Scott 1995, 
2003; Knight 2001; Pauketat et al. 2002; Welch and Scarry 1995). 

Finally, greater interest in political dynamics in the Mississippian South¬ 
east during the past decade has paved the way for consideration of similar 
issues in the LMV (e.g., Anderson 1994a; Cobb 2003; Pauketat and Emerson, 
eds. 1997; Scarry, ed. 1996). Yet, in comparison, less research has focused spe¬ 
cifically on Plaquemine sociopolitical organization or dynamics. Much of what 
we know has been inferred from settlement patterns or extrapolated from 
documentary sources on early historic polities (e.g., Brain 1978; Brown 1985a, 
1998c). The historic Natchez, with widely acknowledged Plaquemine associa¬ 
tions, have informed current understanding of Mississippian polities (I. 
Brown 1990, this volume; Lorenz 1997; cf. Muller 1997:63—68). Recognizing 
the pitfalls of historic analogy (e.g., Galloway 1992, 1993), it would be bene¬ 
ficial to contrast the historical trajectories of regional Plaquemine polities with 
better-known Mississippian data sets (e.g., Knight 1997; Knight and Stepon- 
aitis 1998). 

A system of hereditary social ranking is thought by many to have emerged 
during the Coles Creek period in the LMV, subsequently elaborated upon 
by Plaquemine societies (Barker 1999; Kidder 1992a, 2002:79-90; Steponaitis 
1986:385-387). Site hierarchies have been described for some polities, particu¬ 
larly in the Tensas Basin, Natchez Bluffs, and Lower Yazoo, suggesting multi¬ 
ple levels of political administration (Brain 1978; Kidder 199815:143). Large 
mound sites appear to have become larger and less numerous from Coles 
Creek to Plaquemine times, possibly indicating a process of political centrali¬ 
zation in which certain communities or factions were exerting political au¬ 
thority over larger territories (Brain 1978; Kidder 1992a, 1998b; Wells 1997, 
1998). Kidder (199815:137, 146) suggests that mound-and-plaza arrangements 
become increasingly exclusionary, indicating that elites were appropriating the 
symbols of public ceremony. 

Comparisons among Coles Creek, Plaquemine, and Mississippian polities 
stretch thin beyond this point. One of the greatest challenges in the LMV 



INTRODUCTION AND HISTORICAL OVERVIEW

concerns the relative lack of archaeological evidence for preciosities or prestige 
goods and differential ranking in mortuary practices—the kinds of data that 
have proven helpful in past studies of ranked Mississippian societies (e.g., 
Pauketat 1997a, 1997b; Peebles and Kus 1977; Steponaitis 1991; Welch 1991). 
Another serious issue is the lack of comparable data sets in the LMV. Plaque- 
mine as it is currently conceived may be too normative to encompass regional 
variation within the LMV. Part of the solution, then, will be to develop new 
explanatory models to account for this variation. Rather than approaching the 
Coles Creek-Plaquemine transition in terms of a Mississippian cultural ex¬ 
pansion, it will be more productive to consider Plaquemine as a series of en¬ 
dogenous, local-level practices, influenced in some instances by agents of an 
analogous, macroscale tradition, what has been referred to as a historical pro¬ 
cess of Mississippianization (Pauketat 2001a, 2001b, 2004). This in turn raises 
the thorny question as to whether we might consider “Plaqueminization”— 
born of Coles Creek conservativism and traditions of resistance (see also 
Brown 19980:657). 

The following chapters are arranged more or less geographically, with some 
reflection of a chronological sequence (Figure 1.2). Beginning in the Tensas 
Basin of northeast Louisiana, a somewhat different scenario is emerging than 
across the river at Lake George and the Lower Yazoo Basin. Lori Roe addresses 
the Coles Creek antecedents of Plaquemine mound construction at the Raff- 
man site. Greater attention to the Coles Creek-Plaquemine transition is par¬ 
ticularly warranted in this region, where large mound centers were established 
during the Coles Creek period (Kidder 199813:143). Roe argues for strong con¬ 
tinuities in ceremony and ideology based on mound and plaza construction, 
architecture, and reuse. As a result, archaeologists working in the region must 
turn to Coles Creek rather than Mississippian societies in order to trace the 
antecedents of Plaquemine sociopolitical organization. 

At the Lake Providence Mounds, approximately 20 miles north of Raff- 
man, Douglas Wells and Richard Weinstein have uncovered striking evidence 
for extraregional Mississippian contacts dating from the late Coles Creek tran¬ 
sition. Presenting the results of a recent study by Coastal Environments, Inc., 
Wells and Weinstein demonstrate through sourcing analyses that fineware as¬ 
sociated with the Preston phase (a.d. 1100-1250) included vessels that origi¬ 
nated in the American Bottom region to the north. The expansion of interre¬ 
gional exchange in the development of a Lake Providence elite is suggested, 
although additional data are clearly needed. Subsequent Mississippian influ¬ 
ence on Plaquemine society is regarded as largely indirect, via the Yazoo Basin, 
with Coles Creek society providing the basis for increased social inequalities 
and political centralization.

Moving south along the western edge of the LMV floodplain, Mark Rees 
investigates a series of little-known mound sites in the western Atchafalaya 
Basin, only 40 km (25 miles) west of the Medora site. Continuity between 
Coles Creek and Plaquemine is apparent in pottery types, a lack of shell tem¬ 
pering, and the spatial layout of mound groups. As this is far from resembling 
“Mississippianized Coles Creek,” an argument is made for endogenous politi¬ 
cal development in the context of regional conservativism. Possible connec¬ 
tions between historic Chitimacha villages and ceremonial centers indicate 
that additional research has the potential to substantially expand on current 
understanding of regional political culture. A productive synthesis of culture 
historical and processual perspectives is advocated in this regard. 

Farther southeast in the Barataria Basin of coastal Louisiana, Malcolm 
Shuman draws attention to important yet poorly understood pottery assem¬ 
blages on the north shore of Lake Salvador. From a vantage point deep in the 
Mississippi delta, the Plaquemine-Mississippian connection (divide?) seems 
more curious than ever, raising new questions concerning the apparent source, 
direction, and actual process of Mississippianization. As Shuman points out, 
Mississippian influence of some sort appears to have entered the LMV from 
the east, namely in the adoption of shell tempering at sites in the delta and 
Gulf coastal plain. Distinctions between Plaquemine and Mississippian are 
not so clear from the perspective of the Barataria phase, particularly if shell 
tempering is to serve as a diagnostic marker. Nor does there appear to have 
been a simple progression from grog-tempered to shell-tempered pottery 
types, raising fundamental questions regarding transitional Coles Creek. If 
such distinctions seem muddied this far south, it seems as though a careful 
reexamination of basic concepts is long overdue. Shuman also provides a com¬ 
pelling example of the difficulty in applying cultural generalizations about 
Plaquemine to its many diverse phases. 

Moving east across the Mississippi all the way to the Pearl River, Patrick 
Livingood examines the introduction of shell tempering as a basis for under¬ 
standing Mississippianization. Using a digital image analysis technique, Liv¬ 
ingood examines the paste recipes of Plaquemine potters at the Pevey and 
Lowe-Steen sites in south-central Mississippi. Pottery types based largely on 
grog or shell tempering do not separate into simple categories under digital 
image analysis but instead suggest the use of temper in paste recipes was a 
functional and aesthetic decision associated with household production. Con¬ 
ventional categories and assumptions must consequently be reexamined. 

On the Natchez Bluffs to the west, Virgil Beasley presents the results of the 
1997 excavations at the Anna site, a major Plaquemine mound center and the 



REES AND LIVINGOOD 


18 

type site for the Anna phase (a.d. 1200-1350). Long associated with ancestors 
of the historic Natchez, the Anna site has been described along with sites such 
as Emerald, Foster, and Fatherland as representative of the shifting political 
fortunes of Plaquemine chiefdoms on the Natchez Bluffs (Brain 1978; Brown 
1985a, this volume; Neitzel 1965). Investigation of architectural remains in a 
mound precinct at Anna yielded associated ceramic and faunal deposits. 
Along with architectural evidence for a small scaffold or screen, Beasley ar¬ 
gues, these may represent the remains of a ceremonial feast as described in 
early historic accounts of the Natchez. Drawing upon multiple lines of evi¬ 
dence, the archaeological interpretation of ritual feasting holds enormous po¬ 
tential for understanding the relationships between subsistence economy and 
regional political dynamics (e.g., Jackson and Scott 1995, 2003). 

Plaquemine culture in the Natchez Bluffs region of Mississippi is revisited 
by Ian Brown, who summarizes what is presently known about ethnohistoric 
connections with the Natchez, political development, and mound construc¬ 
tion. Fie argues that large mound sites such as Anna and Emerald represent 
the culmination of historical trajectories that produced shifting regional con¬ 
solidation, alliances, and hierarchies. Importantly, he points out that towns 
with mounds and dispersed households were the main components of Plaque¬ 
mine settlement hierarchy on the Natchez Bluffs. Unlike previous Coles Creek 
or contemporaneous Mississippian societies, there do not appear to have been 
large villages without mounds. More controversial, the evidence for mound 
construction points toward Plaquemine rather than Coles Creek origins at 
single-component and multicomponent sites. Discontinuities in architecture 
and pottery lead Brown to further surmise a decisive break between Coles 
Creek and Plaquemine habitation in the Natchez Bluffs region. As to exactly 
what these discontinuities mean will require further study, yet comparison 
with other Plaquemine regions is striking, particularly in the context of a 
Coles Creek transition (e.g., Rees, this volume; Roe, this volume; Shuman, 
this volume; Wells and Weinstein, this volume). 

Moving boldly upriver to the “outer limits” of Plaquemine culture, Marvin 
Jeter reexamines Plaquemine from the perspective of southeast Arkansas or 
the “northerly borderlands.” The noticeable omission of recent research from 
the Lower Yazoo Basin, so prominent in the literature, may appear incongru¬ 
ous (see above). Yet in terms of exactly how Plaquemine is to be reconceptu¬ 
alized, the Lower Yazoo Basin looms large (e.g., Brain 1978, 1989; Phillips 
1970; Williams and Brain 1983). In a wide-ranging essay, Jeter provides an 
introduction to Plaquemine in southeast Arkansas and examines its manifes¬ 
tation in the Bellaire, Bartholomew, and Gran Marais phases. On the basis of 



INTRODUCTION AND HISTORICAL OVERVIEW 


19 


a careful reexamination of the evidence, Jeter concludes that the Bellaire phase 
in the Bartholomew-Macon region, tentatively identified by Phillips (1970), 
might be discarded or subsumed under Mississippian culture. The substantive 
evidence for the Bartholomew and Gran Marais phases is likewise summa¬ 
rized in terms of pottery, lithics, site and settlement data, and subsistence. 
Jeter addresses regional variation in Plaquemine societies in southeast Arkan¬ 
sas, including its antecedents and descendants, and concludes with a compel¬ 
ling argument for connections with ethnohistorically documented groups of 
Native Americans. 

The volume closes with T. R. Kidder “contemplating Plaquemine culture,” 
returning to several of the themes outlined in earlier chapters. Kidder sum¬ 
marizes by emphasizing the local Coles Creek antecedents of Plaquemine so¬ 
cieties and drawing attention to political, economic, and religious practices in 
the LMV after a.d. 1000 , historical variation that he argues cannot adequately 
be accounted for by “unspecified Mississippian influences.” A more nuanced 
understanding of regional political consolidation in the LMV after a.d. 1200 
will likewise require greater attention to both the scale and source of interac¬ 
tions. Turning the familiar homology upside down, if the cultural heirs of 
Coles Creek in the LMV were in fact informed of the imposing Mississippian 
polities upriver and to the east, what conditions and events, what actions 
would have entailed their being or remaining Plaquemine? As the following 
authors demonstrate, the difficult work needed to answer these and other 
questions has just begun.

Coles Creek Antecedents of Plaquemine 
Mound Construction 

Evidence from the Raffman Site

Plaquemine culture (ca. a.d. 1200-1700) developed in the Lower Mississippi 
Valley (LMV) at a time when the Mississippian cultural tradition dominated 
most of southeastern North America. Plaquemine culture shares traits such as 
maize horticulture and hierarchical social organization with Mississippian cul¬ 
tural variants throughout the Southeast (Brain 1989:133; Kidder 1993a). How¬ 
ever, Plaquemine culture maintains a distinct LMV flavor, and differences 
between Plaquemine and Mississippian iconography and technology con¬ 
tinue in some areas into historic times (Kidder 2004b). The local ancestor of 
Plaquemine culture is the Late Woodland Coles Creek culture (ca. a.d. 700- 
1200). While there is continuity between Coles Creek and Plaquemine cul¬ 
ture, important changes in subsistence and sociopolitical developments take 
place during the transition from Coles Creek to Plaquemine. 

Evidence of interaction with Mississippian cultural groups, in the form of 
ceramic and lithic artifacts, is found at some Coles Creek sites in the LMV 
(e.g., Lake Providence, Lake George, and Winterville) beginning around 
a.d. 1000 (Brain 1989; Phillips 1970; Williams and Brain 1983; Wells and 
Weinstein, this volume). The impact this cross-cultural contact had on the 
origin of Plaquemine culture is debated by archaeologists and appears to have 
varied in different subregions of the LMV. Research in the Yazoo Basin, no¬ 
tably work by Williams and Brain (Brain 1989; Williams and Brain 1983), led 
to the idea that Mississippian contact was instrumental in the development of 
Plaquemine culture. However, some archaeologists working in the Tensas Ba¬ 
sin (e.g., Hally 1972; Kidder 1993a) argue that evidence for Mississippian 
influence on the development of Plaquemine culture is equivocal. Disagree¬ 
ment over the nature of the preceding Coles Creek culture contributes to the 
debate over Plaquemine origins. Williams and Brain (1983:405) see the Coles

Creek culture as relatively static, with early innovations followed by nearly 
500 years of “conservative resistance to major change.” However, changes in 
settlement patterns, increases in the scale of earthen mound construction, and 
concomitant alterations of mound-and-plaza site plans have been offered as 
evidence that Coles Creek polities were becoming larger and more hierarchi¬ 
cally organized over the span of the Coles Creek period (Kidder 1992a, 1998b, 
2002:87-88; Wells 1997). In order to understand Plaquemine culture, we must 
examine the developments in the preceding Coles Creek period and reevaluate 
the nature of interactions between Coles Creek and external Mississippian 
groups. 

Earthen mound architecture has factored strongly in interpretations of 
both Coles Creek and Plaquemine sociopolitical organization, and continui¬ 
ties in Coles Creek and Plaquemine mound architecture are the focus of this 
chapter. In particular, results of research at the Raffman site (16MA20), an 
impressive Coles Creek mound-and-plaza center that exhibits strong similari¬ 
ties with later Plaquemine mound centers, are presented (Figure 2.1). Raffman 
is much larger than most contemporary mound centers in the Coles Creek 
region and does not fit the “typical” Coles Creek site plan of two to four 
modest-sized mounds (Williams and Brain 1983:405). The massive scale of 
construction at Raffman and a large and rapid expansion of the site around 
a.d. 1000 suggest that the Raffman vicinity may have been an early locus of 
political complexity in the region and support the idea that significant so¬ 
ciopolitical developments occurred during Coles Creek times. 

There is a long history of platform mound construction in the LMV. The 
first substructural platform mound-and-plaza precincts in the eastern United 
States were constructed by Coles Creek cultural groups (Knight 2001; Wil¬ 
liams and Brain 1983:405). By Plaquemine culture times, platform mound- 
and-plaza precincts clearly served as ceremonial and political centers (Brain 
1978, 1988; Neitzel 1965; Quimby 1951). Continuities in this form of monu¬ 
mental architecture suggest that the ceremonial and, presumably, sociopoliti¬ 
cal organization of Plaquemine began developing during the preceding Coles 
Creek period. The facts that Raffman mound construction and use predates 
Plaquemine culture and that it shows no direct evidence of Mississippian in¬ 
fluences are significant for interpretations of indigenous cultural development 
and cross-cultural interactions in the LMV. 

Coles Creek Culture 

The Coles Creek period (a.d. 700-1200/1250) marks an important transition 
in social organization in the LMV from the relatively egalitarian cultures of

the preceding Baytown period (a.d. 400-700) to the hierarchical chiefdoms 
that prevailed among the Mississippi period Plaquemine culture (a.d. 
1200/1250-1450). Coles Creek culture is found throughout much of the LMY 
from the mouth of the Arkansas River to the Gulf of Mexico. It thrived in 
the Yazoo, Tensas, and Ouachita River basins, in the Natchez Bluffs region, 
and in coastal Louisiana (Figure 2.2).

that distinguish them from earlier types. Ceramics are by far the most abun¬ 
dant artifacts recovered from Coles Creek sites. Settlement types included 
camps, hamlets, villages, and mound centers (Kidder 1992a; Wells 1997). 
Ceremonial site architecture, consisting of flat-topped mounds constructed 
around level plazas, is found throughout the Coles Creek region. Population 
in the region increased during the Coles Creek period, measured by increases 
in overall site size and density (Kidder 2002). Coles Creek subsistence was 
assumed to be based on farming of maize and other tropical and native cul- 
tigens because settlements are typically located on arable lands of major river 
valleys (Williams and Brain 1983:408). Research by Fritz and Kidder (Fritz 
and Kidder 1993; Kidder 1993a; Kidder and Fritz 1993), though, shows that 
maize was not a significant part of the diet until at least a.d. 1200. Even cul- 
tigens of native plants that were farmed elsewhere in the Mississippi River 
valley, such as maygrass and chenopod, are largely absent from Coles Creek 
sites south of the Arkansas River. Recent research indicates there is consider¬ 
able plant food subsistence variability among Coles Creek peoples, with con¬ 
temporary groups living in close proximity practicing different strategies 
(Roberts 2004). 

Evidence for increasing social complexity and the emergence of social elites 
in Coles Creek societies includes construction of platform mounds that may 
have served as the location for elite residences; mound architecture that sug¬ 
gests restriction of access to the mound-and-plaza precinct; a high degree of 
community planning; hierarchical settlement patterns; and, to some degree, 
mortuary patterns (Barker 1999; Belmont 1985; Kidder 1992a, 1998b, 2004b; 
Steponaitis 1986:385-386; Wells 1997; Williams and Brain 1983:370). fFowever, 
status and wealth distinctions are not seen in accumulations of exotic trade 
goods or other prestige items or in elaborate tomb preparations and grave 
offerings. Coles Creek material culture is fairly mundane; ornate special-use 
or ceremonial objects are extremely rare. Few exotic items are found in Coles 
Creek contexts and the large majority of artifacts were made on local materi¬ 
als, suggesting that extraregional trade was uncommon (Kidder 2002:89). 

Excavation of Coles Creek mounds at sites such as Greenhouse, Lake 
George, and Morgan revealed that these features were often constructed in 
multiple stages. Perishable structures were erected on mound summits and 
burials were often interred in the mounds (Ford 1951; Fuller and Fuller 1987; 
Williams and Brain 1983). Mound summit structures have been interpreted as 
residences or charnel houses, on the basis of associated midden deposits or 
burials, though further research is needed to determine what functions these 
structures served (Steponaitis 1986:385). Steponaitis (1986:385-386) observes 



EVIDENCE FROM THE RAFFMAN SITE 


25 


that the construction of multistage platform mounds that appear to have 
served as residences and/or burial locations is reminiscent of platform mounds 
known to have been used by generations of elites in Mississippian and proto- 
historic chiefdoms. He suggests that Coles Creek platform mounds may rep¬ 
resent the emergence of hereditary social ranking, with each mound stage 
being constructed for and used by a new generation of chiefs (Steponaitis 
1986:386). 

Excavations at sites such as Greenhouse, Mount Nebo, and Lake George 
have demonstrated that mound centers were used and expanded over hun¬ 
dreds of years. Greenhouse and Mount Nebo were mortuary ceremonial cen¬ 
ters during the Baytown period and continued to be used for much of the 
Coles Creek period (Belmont 1967; Ford 1951; Giardino 1977; Kidder 1998b; 
Kidder and Fritz 1993). Mounds were constructed over existing structures and 
burial tumuli, eventually resulting in multiple mounds demarcating a central 
plaza. The Lake George site was also occupied during the Baytown and Coles 
Creek periods and had a remarkable expansion during the initial phases of 
Plaquemine culture in the Yazoo Basin (Williams and Brain 1983). 

The continued use or reuse of the same sites as ceremonial centers suggests 
continuity of cultural heritage and the importance of ancestral social and 
ceremonial centers. Coles Creek mound centers were often constructed over 
Baytown period mortuary centers. Steponaitis (1986:386) asserts that Coles 
Creek leaders began to transform these centers—which had previously been 
used for communal burial and ceremony—into symbols of elite power. Kid¬ 
der (1992a) further contends that by constructing residential and burial 
mounds over ancestral burial locations, incipient Coles Creek elites symboli¬ 
cally and physically linked themselves with locations that were of the utmost 
social and ceremonial importance. The aggrandizement of some Coles Creek 
sites as the Plaquemine culture emerged may represent a similar legitimization 
of elite power and desire to perpetuate ancestral ceremonial ties. 

The growth of mound centers, through construction of new mounds and 
enlargement of existing mounds, led to mound-and-plaza precincts that were 
increasingly demarcated from surrounding areas (Kidder 1998b). As opposed 
to there being a single mound adjacent to an open plaza, multiple mounds 
were constructed and these more tightly delineated the boundaries of the 
mound-and-plaza precinct. Kidder (199813:138-139) interprets this physical 
bounding as an indication that access to mound-and-plaza precincts was be¬ 
coming more restricted and that the activities that took place at these precincts 
were becoming more clearly distinguished from activities that took place in 
the villages and hamlets where the large majority of the population lived. This

architectural trend begins in the Coles Creek period, lending support to the 
idea that mound centers became associated with social elites during this time 
(Kidder 1992a, 1998b; Steponaitis 1986:385-386; Williams and Brain 1983). 
The increased scale of mound construction indicates that these centers played 
a more important role in surrounding communities and that social leaders 
were able to coordinate greater labor efforts for mound construction. 

The Raffman Site 

Location and Description 

Unlike many Plaquemine and Mississippian mound centers, Raffman is not 
situated near a major river (see Brain 1978). The site is located near the west 
bank of Tensas Bayou, in Madison Parish, northeast Louisiana (Figure 2.1). 
The Raffman mounds were constructed at the edge of an elevated flood de¬ 
posit created by a crevasse in Joes Bayou to the west. Floodwaters and sedi¬ 
ments broke through the natural levee on Joes Bayou and formed an elevated, 
fan-shaped splay (Kidder 2004a:5i9; Saucier 1994:272-273). 

The great construction efforts expended to create the Raffman site suggest 
that it was an important ceremonial and possibly political center in its region. 
The mounds at Raffman are closely spaced around a central plaza that mea¬ 
sures approximately 80-90 m wide by 100-110 m long (Figure 2.3). Seven 
of these mounds, Mounds A-G, delineate the plaza. The remaining two 
mounds, Mounds H and I, are situated to the southeast of the plaza. The 
largest mound (Mound A) is a flat-topped, rectangular feature, approximately 
12 m tall and 75 m by 100 m at its base. It is located at the southern edge of 
the plaza. Flanking the northwest and northeast corners of Mound A are two 
relatively large platform mounds, labeled B and G. Four more mounds (C, D, 
E, and F) complete the boundary of the central plaza. Mounds A, B, C, G, 
and I have well-defined, flat summits. Mounds E and F have low, slightly 
rounded summits, and Mounds D and H are conical. 

Because of the size, shape, and arrangement of earthworks at Raffman, the 
site was considered by some to be a Mississippi period site, associated with the 
Plaquemine culture (Kidder i998b:i43; Phillips i970:Figure 447). Investiga¬ 
tions at Raffman, however, revealed that the earthworks are primarily Coles 
Creek period constructions. These excavations also demonstrated that, in ad¬ 
dition to mound construction, extensive landscaping was involved in the crea¬ 
tion of the mound-and-plaza precinct (Kidder 2004a; Kidder and Roe 1999). 
Additionally, excavations in mound summits and slope midden deposits have 
uncovered cultural remains associated with mound activities.

Research at Raffman 

Located in a large, dense tract of woods, the Raffman mounds are difficult to 
access. Raffman’s isolation has made research at the site challenging but has 
also contributed to the site’s excellent preservation. Raffman was first recorded 
as an archaeological site by Phillips and Neitzel in 1954. Archaeological inves¬ 
tigations at the site over the next few decades were extremely limited. In 1981, 
Williams, Belmont, and Kardish mapped the site with a tape and compass and 
excavated shovel tests (Belmont 1985:272).

LORI ROE 


In the summer of 1998, Kidder initiated more extensive investigation of the 
Raffman site. These investigations were continued during the summers of 
2000, 2002, and 2004. Initial research goals included establishing a basic oc¬ 
cupation sequence for the site, uncovering evidence of how and when the 
mounds were constructed, and examining the geomorphology of the Raffman 
vicinity. During the initial field season, a single i-by-i-m excavation unit was 
placed in the slope of each mound and two units were placed in the plaza. 
Solid soil cores extracted from the mounds and plaza provided further infor¬ 
mation about site stratigraphy. In addition, two backhoe trenches were exca¬ 
vated. The “north trench” was located at the edge of the raised landform on 
which Raffman is situated and the “south trench” was located at the south¬ 
west toe of Mound B (Figure 2.3) (see Kidder 2004a). Later fieldwork has 
been focused on excavation of mound summits and slopes to examine midden 
deposits and activity areas on the mounds. Additional soil cores were ex¬ 
tracted from the mounds and from non-mound contexts; these cores have 
proved to be a valuable source of information about the construction of the 
site. 

Construction Chronology and Mound Use 

The Raffman site is large and stratigraphically complex; mound construction 
and landscaping at the site are extensive. Additional excavations and analyses 
will be necessary to provide more details about the exact sequence of mound 
construction and the function of each mound at Raffman. However, field 
investigations and analyses of cultural remains to date have provided a frame¬ 
work for the chronology of construction and occupation at Raffman. Exami¬ 
nation of cultural remains from Raffman, especially those associated with 
mound activity areas, is ongoing. Available data do not indicate how each 
mound at Raffman was used. It is clear, though, that not all the mounds were 
used for the same purpose or activities. Mounds at Raffman vary in terms of 
size, shape, stratigraphy, and the presence or absence of associated occupation 
debris. Following is a discussion of the current data on site chronology and 
mound function. 

Cultural remains at Raffman indicate occupation during the Tchula (ca. 500 
b.c.-a.d. 1) and Marksville (ca. a.d. 1-400) periods, prior to construction of 
the mounds. There is a notable absence of cultural remains that can be con¬ 
fidently dated to the Baytown period (ca. a.d. 400-700). A few surface- 
collected ceramics dating to the Fitzhugh phase of the Plaquemine culture 
(ca. a.d. 1400-1500) suggest an ephemeral occupation during the Mississippi 
period (Kidder 2004a:523, 525). Coles Creek cultural components at Raffman 
include early (ca. a.d. 700-1000) and late (ca. a.d. 1000-1250) phases. Re-

search thus far indicates that all mound construction, with the possible excep¬ 
tion of Mound I, dates to the Coles Creek period (Kidder 20043:519-526). 

Excavations were conducted on the summit of Mound A, and a single ex¬ 
cavation was located on the lower northwest slope (Figure 2.3). No structural 
remains or other occupation debris was uncovered on the mound summit. A 
mound construction stage that contained relatively few artifacts was situated 
immediately underneath the humus stratum. Hand augering on the summit 
revealed that this mound construction stage was at least 2.5 m thick. Likewise, 
excavation on the slope of the mound did not reveal any evidence of occupa¬ 
tion debris associated with the mound (Kidder 2004a: 519). Though three con¬ 
struction episodes were identified on the basis of color and texture differences, 
there was no evidence of occupation debris or erosion between these mound 
fill strata (Kidder 2004a: 519). 

Mound A is a very large earthwork, and excavations to date cannot rule 
out the possibility that earlier mound stages were used for residence, ritual, or 
burial. However, no evidence for activities associated with this mound has 
been uncovered. Excavations did uncover a sub-mound midden, though. A 
radiocarbon date from charcoal near the surface of this midden deposit places 
the final accumulation of the midden around a.d. 700-750 (Table 2.1). Ce¬ 
ramics from the midden are in line with this date, including early Coles Creek 
period varieties of Baytown Plain, with two early Coles Creek period deco¬ 
rated sherds (French Fork Incised, var. Larkin and Coles Creek Incised, var. 
unspecified) (see Phillips 1970:69-70, 85). There is no indication that a sub¬ 
stantial amount of time elapsed between the final deposition of this midden 
and the initial construction of Mound A (Kidder 2004a: 519). 

Ceramics from sub-mound middens also suggest that construction of 
Mounds B and C was begun in the early Coles Creek period. Extensive exca¬ 
vations have been conducted in Mound B, and the results of these investiga¬ 
tions are discussed in the following section. Mound C has had only limited 
testing, consisting of a single excavation on the slope of the mound, soil cores 
extracted from the mound, and probing for occupation debris on the summit 
using an Oakfield soil corer. Ceramics from midden underlying Mound C are 
similar to those found under Mound A and indicate a contemporary occupa¬ 
tion (Kidder 20043:519). A radiocarbon date from this sub-mound midden 
places the construction of Mound C around a.d. 800-900 (Table 2.1). Mound 
C appears to have been constructed in a single episode; no occupation debris 
has been located on the mound slopes or on the flat summit. 

Mounds D, H, and I have also only been subjected to limited testing. 
Available data suggest that Mounds D and H were constructed during the 
Coles Creek period and that Mound I was constructed perhaps during termi-

nal Coles Creek period or Plaquemine times. Mound D overlies a midden that 
contains a few Marksville decorated sherds and plainwares that appear to date 
from the Marksville, Baytown, and/or early Coles Creek periods. Mound D 
construction fill contains early Coles Creek decorated sherds. A single stage of 
construction was identified during excavation, and no midden deposits were 
uncovered on the surface of this dome-shaped mound. Mound H overlies a 
Tchula and Marksville period midden, and the fill of the mound contains 
Coles Creek ceramics. No occupation debris was uncovered on the mound 
surface. Mound I overlies a midden that contains ceramics associated with the 
terminal Coles Creek and Plaquemine periods (Baytown Plain, var. Addis, 
Baytown Plain, var. unspecified, and a single sherd of Plaquemine Brushed, 
var. unspecified). It is unclear whether prehistoric occupation debris is associ¬ 
ated with the mound surface. The upper surface of the mound was disturbed 
by the construction of an early nineteenth-century house. 

At approximately a.d. 1000, a large expansion of Raffman was undertaken. 
The elevated crevasse splay on which Raffman is situated was artificially ex¬ 
tended to the northeast. This landscape modification served to enlarge the 
plaza and created space for additional mound construction (Kidder 2004a). 
Stratigraphy in soil cores and the north backhoe trench revealed that an 
artificial platform, measuring approximately 100 m long, 40 m wide, and 3-4 
m thick, underlies Mounds E and F (Kidder 20043:520-526). A radiocarbon 
date from charcoal near the base of the artificial platform and another from 
midden overlying the slope of Mound E indicate that the platform was rap¬ 
idly constructed (Table 2.1) (Kidder 20043:519-520). Excavation and soil cores 
suggest that Mound E was constructed in two small stages and that occupa¬ 
tion debris is associated with each stage (Kidder 20043:520). A sub-mound 
midden was uncovered in excavations of Mound F, but no midden deposits 
were recovered from the surface of the mound (Kidder 20043:520). 

The eastern portion of Mound G appears to overlie an artificial surface 
that was constructed to extend the natural ground surface to the east. Exca¬ 
vations and soil cores have revealed that the western portion of the mound 
overlies a midden containing Tchula and Marksville period ceramics, and the 
eastern portion rests on over 2 m of loaded soil. It is not known whether this 
extension of the natural ground surface was constructed rapidly or whether it 
is part of the artificial platform constructed on the northeast side of the plaza. 
A radiocarbon date from midden overlying the first construction stage of 
Mound G places the initial use of this mound in the Coles Creek period, but 
the date has a large standard deviation (Table 2.1). Mound G was constructed 
in at least two stages, and occupation debris has been recovered from the 
surface of each stage.

Occupation at Raffman continued until the end of the Coles Creek period. 
Radiocarbon dates and ceramics from occupation debris on the summit and 
east slope of Mound B indicate that the mound was used until approximately 
a.d. 1100-1200 (Table 2.1). As discussed above, the erection of Mound I ap¬ 
pears to be the final episode of mound construction at Raffman. Whether this 
mound was constructed after a hiatus of occupation at the Raffman site is not 
known. 

Mound B Investigations 

Mound B is the most extensively excavated mound at Raffman (Figure 2.4). 
This platform mound is approximately 2.5 m tall, with a large square summit 
approximately 25 m on each side. The mound was constructed in two distinct 
stages, and occupation debris overlies each of these mound stages. The initial 
mound stage (stage B-i) was constructed and used during the early Coles 
Creek period, and the second stage (stage B-2) was used during the late to 
terminal Coles Creek period. Mound stage B-i appears to be a small, low 
platform. The summit and one slope of this platform were encountered dur¬ 
ing excavations on Mound B. Construction of mound stage B-2 greatly in¬ 
creased the size of the mound summit. 

Most ceramics recovered from the surface of mound stage B-i are Baytown 
Plain. Among the few decorated sherds recovered from the surface of this 
mound stage are examples of Coles Creek Incised, var Coles Creek and Mul¬ 
berry Creek Cord Marked, var Smith Creek. The remains of a few small posts 
(10-13 cm in diameter) were uncovered on the surface of this first mound 
stage, but no pattern of posts was discernable. 

Midden deposits and structural remains have also been excavated from the 
summit and east slope of mound stage B-2, the final construction stage. Re¬ 
mains of posts, ranging in size from 15 to 30 cm in diameter, are concentrated 
in the southeast quarter of the summit. The size and shape of the structure or 
structures represented by these posts are not discernable. A possible hearth 
was uncovered in the southeast quarter of the summit as well. Midden depos¬ 
its on the mound contained abundant ceramics and faunal remains and smaller 
amounts of lithics. Analysis of the cultural remains recovered from Mound B 
is in progress. Initial examination of these remains suggests that Mound B 
may have been a residential mound. 

Three radiocarbon dates from midden deposits on the east slope and sum¬ 
mit of mound stage B-2 indicate that this final stage of the mound was used 
circa a.d. 1100-1200. A radiocarbon date from charred wood recovered near 
the base of one of the post molds on the Mound B summit indicates a some-

what earlier occupation, though the 2-sigma ranges of the dates overlap (Table 
2.1). Ceramics recovered from midden deposits on the mound surface also 
indicate a late to terminal Coles Creek occupation of the mound. The major¬ 
ity of ceramics are markers of the Balmoral phase (a.d. iooo-iioo), a late 
Coles Creek phase in the Tensas Basin. Commonly represented decorative 
types include Coles Creek Incised, vars. Coles Creek and Mott, Beldeau In¬ 
cised, var. unspecified, and French Fork Incised decorative motifs on wares 
with fine grog tempering. There are also some examples of decorative and 
paste varieties that are typically associated with the Preston phase (a.d. iioo- 
1200), considered a transitional phase between the Coles Creek and Plaque- 
mine cultures in the Tensas Basin. These include sherds classified as Carter 
Engraved, var unspecified, Mazique Incised, var Preston, and a few sherds of 
Baytown Plain, var. Addis. The radiocarbon dates from Mound B surface mid¬ 
den and the presence of some Preston phase ceramic markers indicate that 
Mound B was used during this culturally transitional phase. However, the 
ceramics from Mound B midden deposits do not resemble a typical Preston 
phase assemblage (see Kidder I993a:75-i09; Ryan 2004). The ceramic assem- 



34 


LORI ROE 


blage from Mound B is weighted toward the earlier Balmoral phase. The mid¬ 
den does not appear to be stratified, with earlier ceramic types more abundant 
in lower levels and later types more abundant in upper levels. In addition, 
dates from two different levels within the midden are essentially identical. 

Social Implications of Raffman Mound Architecture 

There is a notable lack of direct evidence for contact with Mississippian 
groups at Raffman. There are no shell-tempered ceramics or imported ce¬ 
ramic styles. Rather, the combination of radiocarbon dates and ceramics from 
Mound B (stage B-2) suggests that the occupants at Raffman were somewhat 
conservative in terms of ceramic technology and style. Raffman demonstrates 
that large, impressive mound sites existed in the LMV without obvious in¬ 
fluences from Mississippian groups. 

The scale of mound construction and landscaping at Raffman is far greater 
than expected for the petty chiefdoms thought to characterize the socio¬ 
political landscape of the Coles Creek period. Large Coles Creek sites like 
Raffman, and perhaps Mott (16FR11) as well (see Barker 1992:15, 42; Morgan 
1999), may represent the centers of large hierarchically organized Coles Creek 
societies. 

The scale and arrangement of mound-and-plaza architecture at Raffman 
suggests an elite arena, physically separated from the community as a whole 
(Kidder 1998b). Substantial effort was expended to artificially extend the 
natural ground surface in order to construct more mounds around the plaza, 
indicating that the configuration of the site was of considerable importance. 
Furthermore, elite leaders may have been living on some of the Raffman 
mounds, aligning themselves with ceremonial locations and setting them¬ 
selves apart from the rest of the community. 

The large-scale, rapid expansion of the mound-and-plaza precinct circa 
a.d. 1000 suggests that Raffman’s position in the sociopolitical landscape had 
shifted. Raffman had presumably become an important ceremonial and po¬ 
litical center. The grandeur of the site would have commanded respect for the 
leaders who coordinated its construction and perhaps for all communities in¬ 
teracting with the Raffman site. 

Comparison of Mound Architecture 

The mounds at Raffman are similar in size and configuration to Plaquemine 
sites in the Tensas Basin, such as Routh and Fitzhugh (Kidder 1998b). Raff¬ 
man, Routh, and Fitzhugh each have a preeminent truncated pyramidal 
mound, with other large, relatively closely spaced mounds arranged around a 
single plaza (see Gibson 1996; Ffally 1972; Morgan 1999). 



EVIDENCE FROM THE RAFFMAN SITE

While ceremonial activities presumably took place at Coles Creek mound 
centers, the centers do not appear to have supported large resident popula¬ 
tions. Late Coles Creek mound sites are not necessarily “vacant” ceremonial 
centers; however, those sites that have been investigated do not have extensive 
occupation debris on or between the mounds (Kidder 2002; Williams and 
Brain 1983). During the Coles Creek period, occupation seems to have shifted 
away from the mound-and-plaza area (see Kidder 1992a, 1998b). While nearby 
settlements have been discovered at late Coles Creek mound sites such as Mott 
(Barker 1992:55-59), occupation on the mounds appears to be restricted to 
fewer individuals, presumably civic and/or religious leaders (Kidder 2002; 
Williams and Brain 1983:407). The relative scarcity of occupation at the 
mound-and-plaza precinct continues into Plaquemine cultural times. While 
Plaquemine mound sites often supported larger resident populations than 
their Coles Creek predecessors, most do not show evidence of intensive occu¬ 
pation, unlike Mississippian mound centers to the north (Brain 1978; Brown 
1985b; Hally 1972). 

Relative to its size, the Raffman site does not have much occupation debris 
on or between the mounds. In addition, soil coring outside the mound-and- 
plaza precinct combined with surface survey in plowed agricultural fields has 
yet to reveal a residential area near Raffman. However, the entire landscape 
around Raffman was blanketed with between 30 and 70 cm of fine-grained 
sediment as a consequence of postoccupational flooding and thus traditional 
site survey is not likely to provide good evidence of Coles Creek settlement 
patterning. The Routh site, a Tensas Basin mound site that has components 
spanning the late Coles Creek and Plaquemine cultures, also has few midden 
deposits in and around the mound-and-plaza precinct (Hally 1972:228, 243). 
The Fitzhugh mound site, another Plaquemine mound site in the Tensas Ba¬ 
sin, has more occupation debris than Routh but still does not appear to have 
been a residential location for a large population (Hally 1972:137). 

Contact with External Mississippian Groups 

Interaction between Coles Creek and Mississippian groups in the LMV ap¬ 
pears to have varied between and within geographical subregions and was not 
necessarily correlated with the size or complexity of the Coles Creek polities 
involved in the interaction. Mississippian pottery and projectile points from 
the Central Mississippi Valley and American Bottom are found at Coles Creek 
settlements in the Yazoo Basin. Evidence of interaction with Mississippian 
groups is well known from the Lake George and Winterville mound sites in 
the Yazoo Basin (Brain 1989; Williams and Brain 1983). Large construction 
efforts and alterations to the site layout are evident at these sites after contact

LORI ROE 


with Mississippian groups began and have been attributed to Mississippian 
cultural influences (Brain 1989; Williams and Brain 1983). There is less evi¬ 
dence for Mississippian contact in other regions of the Coles Creek culture 
area, and some archaeologists (Brain 1978; Hally 1972; Kidder 1993a) have 
argued that Mississippian influences on the development of Plaquemine cul¬ 
ture in the Yazoo Basin were much more pronounced than in the Tensas Basin 
or Natchez Bluffs regions. Changes in mound-and-plaza architecture associ¬ 
ated with the transition from Coles Creek to Plaquemine cultures are less dra¬ 
matic in the Tensas Basin, where Coles Creek sites like Raffman and Mott are 
very similar architecturally to Plaquemine sites like Routh and Fitzhugh. 

Recent excavations led by Wells and Weinstein (this volume) at the Lake 
Providence mound site, however, have demonstrated that direct Mississippian 
contacts did occur in the Tensas Basin. These excavations uncovered ceramics 
from Cahokia as well as locally produced imitations of Mississippian pottery. 
The Lake Providence site is located approximately 20 miles north of Raffman. 
Trade goods and local copies of foreign ceramics are associated with a Preston 
phase, or terminal Coles Creek, occupation at Lake Providence (Weinstein 
2005; Wells and Weinstein, this volume), indicating temporal overlap in 
Raffman and Lake Providence occupations. However, while extraregional in¬ 
teractions may have played a role in sociopolitical developments at Lake Provi¬ 
dence (Wells and Weinstein, this volume), there is no indication that Raff- 
man’s leaders were pursuing similar contacts and alliances. 

Discussion 

Strong continuities are evident between the Coles Creek and Plaquemine cul¬ 
tures. Coles Creek antecedents to Plaquemine mound construction suggest 
hierarchical social organization and hereditary rights to leadership may have 
developed among Coles Creek societies. The great scale of mound construc¬ 
tion and landscaping at the Raffman site and the presence of a possible resi¬ 
dential structure on the Mound B summit support the claim that social elites 
commanded control of large communities in some Coles Creek societies. 

Continuities in ceremony and ideology are indicated by similarities in 
mound-and-plaza architecture and mound construction techniques and by 
reuse of the same locations for ceremonial precincts. The relative lack of oc¬ 
cupation at Plaquemine mound centers is reminiscent of Coles Creek mound 
sites, not Mississippian sites. However, there is an apparent increase in popu¬ 
lation at some Plaquemine mound sites compared with Coles Creek sites, and 
this change may reflect influences from Mississippian societies. 

Changes in subsistence and extraregional exchange are perhaps the core

37 


developments of the Plaquemine culture. Plaquemine settlement patterns in 
the Yazoo Basin appear to reflect the increased importance of maize as well as 
the importance of access to and control of major water transportation routes 
(Brain 1978). However, few cultural developments and transitions are seen 
universally in the entire Plaquemine cultural area. Mississippian technologies 
such as shell-tempered pottery and wall-trench houses were not universally 
adopted in the LMV during Plaquemine times. Even societies that adopted 
these technologies often continued to use traditional LMV ceramic and struc¬ 
tural technologies as well (Brown 1985b; Hally 1972; Williams and Brain 1983). 

The distribution of shell-tempered pottery and Mississippian projectile 
points at LMV sites demonstrates varying degrees of interaction and exchange 
between Coles Creek and Mississippian cultural groups. There is little doubt 
that contact with Mississippian groups influenced the development of Plaque¬ 
mine culture. However, possible antecedents to Plaquemine social organiza¬ 
tion and ceremonial activities are indicated by the architecture and landscap¬ 
ing of large Coles Creek mound complexes like Raffman. Coles Creek groups 
were probably not passive recipients of Mississippian cultural influences. 
Changes in the Coles Creek political landscape may have led some groups to 
seek extraregional alliances. Additionally, subsistence changes may have both 
facilitated and required trade. As Hally (1972) has suggested, goods and pre¬ 
sumably ideas were traveling up as well as down the Mississippi during this 
period of change in the LMV

Recent Data from the Lake Providence Mounds, 
East Carroll Parish, Louisiana 

Douglas C. Wells and Richard A. Weinstein 


The Lake Providence Mounds site (16EC6) is located in the upper Tensas 
Basin, 4.5 miles north of the town of Lake Providence, East Carroll Parish, 
Louisiana (Figure 3.1). What remains of the site lies beneath and immediately 
adjacent to the west side of the modern Mississippi River levee (known in the 
area as the Wilson Point New Levee) that was constructed through the region 
in the 1930s. Unfortunately, extensive levee borrow pits removed most of the 
site’s occupation area to the east of the levee, and the levee itself buried or 
destroyed two of the mounds. Prior to levee construction, the site consisted 
of at least five mounds grouped around a central plaza, a man-made ridge 
located at the south edge of the plaza, and buried aboriginal midden deposits 
covering an area of about 116,280 m 2 (28 acres) (Figure 3.2). 

In the 1990s, the Vicksburg District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, de¬ 
cided that additional levee construction in the area of the mounds needed to 
take place to prevent water seepage under the levee. Accordingly, the site was 
tested in 1996 and later subjected to data-recovery excavations in 1998-1999 
by personnel from Coastal Environments, Inc. (Weinstein 2005). 

Three test units, a series of six “well units,” and two block excavations were 
the main means by which the site was examined (see Figure 3.2). Two of the 
test units were located in Mounds D and E and produced excellent views of 
mound construction. The unit placed atop Mound D showed that the mound 
consisted of at least three different construction stages, with the lowest stage 
presenting some of the best-preserved basket loading ever seen by the investi¬ 
gators (Figure 3.3). In fact, it appears that the basket loads actually consist of

removed by the same levee construction. The relict channel situated immediately to the south 
probably was the source of the alluvium that buried much of the site. TU, Test unit; WU, well

“sod blocks” (Van Nest et al. 2001) that had been acquired from a grassy area 
near the site and then deposited upside down, causing the old A horizon to 
appear at the base of each block. The unit in Mound E uncovered the remains 
of a mound-top midden deposit that was filled with hundreds of artifacts, 
including a unique assemblage of aboriginal ceramics that will be discussed 
in more detail shortly. 

The block excavations examined areas southeast of Mound D and north-

west of Mound B. Block i uncovered evidence of a low ridge that contained 
numerous wall trenches and postholes indicative of at least three building 
episodes that included extensive walls and small, square structures of un¬ 
known function (Figure 3.4). The ridge, in fact, likely extended to the north¬ 
west and actually formed the initial construction stage recognized in the test 
unit in Mound D. Block 2 revealed a sequence of midden layers separated by 
thin flood deposits and a large trash pit that contained organically rich layers 
of redeposited trash, including ash, charcoal, fired clay, and a wealth of arti- 
factual, faunal, and botanical refuse. A variety of faunal remains were re¬ 
corded, including squirrel, deer, turtle, fish, waterfowl, opossum, and raccoon. 
Surprisingly, tree squirrels were dominant in terms of numbers of identified 
specimens present and second only to white-tailed deer in total weight of 
bone (Scott 2005). Of the botanical remains, corn was particularly abundant 
(ca. 70-percent ubiquity) along with arboreal resources such as persimmon, 
pecan, and acorn (Roberts 2005). Considering the proximity of the trash pit 
to Mound B, it was envisioned that much of the fill represented material dis¬ 
carded by the inhabitants who lived atop that mound. 

Occupation Sequence at Lake Providence 

In addition to the general stratigraphic sequence uncovered in each area of 
the site during the testing and data-recovery excavations, 22 radiocarbon dates 
were obtained from charred material (almost all of which was wood charcoal), 
organic sediment from bulk soil samples, charred seeds, or baked-on cooking 
residue scraped from the outer surface of several of the site’s sherds. Likewise, 
27 samples of soil were submitted for oxidizable carbon ratio (OCR) dating. 
When all of these dates were coupled with the various artifacts recovered 
across the site, it was possible to develop what is believed to be a fairly accurate 
sequence of site occupation and mound and ridge construction, at least for 
those areas within the Corps’ right-of-way that were available for archaeologi¬ 
cal research. This sequence is shown graphically in Figures 3.5 and 3 . 6 . 

A few scattered sherds related to the Tchefuncte and Marksville cultures, 
plus one dart point base, mark the first evidence of occupation in the area of 
the Lake Providence site, although all were found in secondary contexts, such 
as mound or pit fill. These were very brief and ephemeral occupations that 
played no role in the construction of the earthworks at the site. Any midden 
once associated with these occupations probably was situated along the edge 
of the relict Mississippi River channel located to the northeast of the site, an 
area destroyed by the 1930s levee (see Figure 3.6a). 

The first occupation for which intact deposits still exist can be dated to the

late Balmoral phase of the late Coles Creek period (ca. a.d. 1065-1080). Iden¬ 
tified simply as Occupation I, evidence for this comes from the pre-mound 
midden found beneath Mound E and the similar pre-ridge midden found 
beneath the ridge in Block 1 (see Figure 3.6b). Despite the fact that the ce¬ 
ramic sample associated with this occupation is somewhat limited in size, it 
contains a sherd of Coles Creek Incised, var. Mott and three Vicksburg rims. 
Although such sherds were found in subsequent occupations dating to the 
succeeding Preston phase, their early stratigraphic position, the lack of later 
ceramics, and several complementary chronometric dates indicate that occu¬ 
pation during the Balmoral phase was a reality. It is uncertain whether mound 
construction began during the phase, but the initial stages of Mounds A and 
C are shown to reflect such a possibility (see Figure 3.6b). 

Regardless of the minor Balmoral component, the main occupation at Lake

and the trash pit in Block 2 was utilized. Certainly the extensive walls and 
wall-trench structures found in Block 1 date from this time. 

Given the relatively short Preston phase occupation identified at the site, 
plus its occurrence right at the tail end of the Coles Creek period, one would 
be hard pressed to find a ceramic assemblage with a more “transitional” look 
to it. Decorative styles normally attributable to both the Coles Creek and 
Plaquemine cultures are found in these deposits, plus a few sherds suggestive 
of Mississippian culture (Figure 3.7). Ceramics typically considered markers 
for the preceding Balmoral phase, such as Coles Creek Incised, vars. Mott, 
Greenhouse, and Blakely and Mazique Incised, var. Kings Point, are present 
in the Preston deposits, as are ceramics generally associated with the Routh 
phase: Plaquemine Brushed, var. Plaquemine, Coles Creek Incised, var. Hardy, 
Mazique Incised, var. Manchac, and a number of other early Plaquemine 
types and varieties that occur on a paste equivalent to the Addis variety of 
Baytown Plain. That these sherds do not represent separate occupations but 
rather a single cohesive unit is evident from the repeated and consistent asso¬ 
ciations of these markers across the site, both in sealed midden deposits and 
in the undisturbed fill of trash pits, wall trenches, and postholes. 

Despite the presence of the above ceramics typically considered indicative 
of the Balmoral and Routh phases, the great majority of the Lake Providence 
collection can be assigned, without any hesitation, to the Preston phase, the 
terminal expression of Coles Creek culture in the Tensas Basin. Most impor¬ 
tant are those ceramics with a paste equivalent to the Little Tiger variety of 
Baytown Plain (Figures 3.8 and 3.9). These sherds provide the most consistent 
and identifiable markers for the Preston phase. Well-established Preston varie¬ 
ties, such as Coles Creek Incised, var. Hilly Grove and Mazique Incised, var. 
Preston (Belmont 1983; Fuller and Kelley 1993; Flally 1972), are now joined by 
several newly proposed or redefined varieties that are based on Joanne Ryan’s 
(2004) work on the ceramics from the Hedgeland site, Cherie Schwabs (1996) 
masters thesis at Louisiana State University, and the present investigations at 
Lake Providence. These include Plaquemine Brushed, var. Blackwater, Carter 
Engraved, var. Crawford, Anna Incised, vars. Hedgeland, Little Red, and Tassin, 
Rhinehart Punctated, var. Chatlin, Avoyelles Punctated, var. Stack Island, 
Hollyknowe Pinched, var. Rose Hill, Evansville Punctated, var. Jack Falls, and 
possibly French Fork Incised, var. Iberville (Figure 3.10). With the exception 
of the last variety, all are within the stylistic limits of the decorated varieties 
normally associated with the Routh phase, but they occur on a medium to 
fine grog-tempered paste that does not meet the criteria of Addis. 

Also present within the Preston assemblage at Lake Providence is a group 
of ceramics identified by Wells (2005) as the “Preston fineware complex.” This

It was realized fairly quickly that many of these latter shell-tempered sherds 
did not fit comfortably into assemblages from the region, and a search of the 
literature and consultation with colleagues in neighboring regions led to the 
conclusion that a significant portion of the pottery might have been im¬ 
ported. Many of these exotic-looking sherds closely resembled pottery from 
the American Bottom region, in particular the Mississippian sites concen¬ 
trated around the great mound center of Cahokia. Included were most of the 
classic elements of the so-called Powell set, a group of ceramic types and va¬ 
rieties established by Williams and Brain (1983:321) to reflect the remains of 
vessels considered to be direct imports from the American Bottom—Powell 
Plain, var. Powell (n = 278), Ramey Incised, var. Ramey (n = 2), and Old Town 
Red, var. Cahokia (n = 70) (Figure 3.12)—together numbering 350 sherds. Of 
some surprise was that this assemblage represents the largest collection of 
American Bottom ceramics from any site in the Lower Mississippi Valley 
(LMV). Also included were 61 sherds of the related Coker set (Williams and 
Brain 1983:321-322), a group of locally made ceramics that are thought to rep¬ 
resent copies of the exotic vessels associated with the Powell set—Mississippi 
Plain, var. Coker (n = 34) and Old Town Red, var. Sharbrough (n = 27) (see 
Figures 3.10 and 3.12)—which brought the total number of American Bottom 
sherds or copies of American Bottom sherds at Lake Providence to 411. To 
these can be added a partial vessel typed as Coleman Incised (Figure 3.13a) 
that was made on local paste but whose decoration is exceedingly similar to 
that found on Ramey Incised, plus a single Mississippi Triangular, var. Ca¬ 
hokia arrow point fashioned from Illinois kaolin chert (see Figure 3.13b). Al¬ 
though found in small amounts in most contexts at the site, these exotics or 
exotic-inspired ceramics came primarily from the midden atop Mound E, the 
fill of the Block 2 trash pit just northwest of Mound B, and the midden and 
structures atop the ridge in Block 1 southeast of Mound D. Clearly, these 
locations suggest elite, high-status deposits. 

The “Cahokia Horizon” in the LMV 

In the concluding chapter of their report on the Lake George site, Stephen 
Williams and Jeffrey Brain (1983:409-412) devoted several pages of text to¬ 
ward an attempt to identify the nature and extent of the so-called Cahokia 
horizon in the LMV, particularly at sites within the Yazoo Basin. They recog¬ 
nized this horizon as a distinct event that took place during terminal Coles 
Creek times and was marked by unmistakable evidence of direct contact with 
the great site of Cahokia and other locales in the American Bottom region of 
southern Illinois. Williams and Brain theorized that such contact occurred

between circa a.d. 1150 and 1250 and, within the Yazoo Basin, was most no¬ 
ticeable at sites with components of the Crippen Point phase, especially the 
large mound centers of Winterville and Lake George (Figure 3.14). 

The main evidence indicative of contact with Cahokia came in the form 
of exotic ceramics, although at least one foreign arrow point also was noted. 
As discussed above, Williams and Brain (1983:321) classified the exotic pottery 
as elements within their Powell set, including Ramey, Cahokia, Powell and 
Tippets Incised, var Tippets. They also recognized two closely related ceramic 
groups, labeled the Coker set and the Yazoo 1 subset (Williams and Brain 
1983:321-322). As noted previously, these latter sets included locally made ce¬ 
ramics that were viewed as copies of the exotic vessels associated with the 
Powell set. Included were such varieties as Cahokia Cord Marked, var. Mon¬ 
trose and Old Town Red, var. Sharbrough for the Coker set and Cahokia Cord 
Marked, var. Buford and Old Town Red, var. Old Town for the Yazoo 1 subset. 
One arrow point, given the name Mississippi Triangular, var. Titterington, 
also was seen as excellent evidence of Cahokia contact (Williams and Brain 
1983:236). 

Seven sites in the Yazoo Basin were identified as having produced examples 
of the Powell, Coker, and Yazoo 1 sets, thereby indicating direct ties to the 
American Bottom region (Williams and Brain i983:Figure 12.15), while several

other sites were known to have yielded only elements of the Yazoo i subset, 
thus implying some type of horizon influence, though not necessarily direct 
contact. In concluding their discussion, Williams and Brain (1983:411-412) 
noted: “The Yazoo remains the best laboratory for the consideration of the 
events outlined above. Artifactual diagnostics of Cahokia have not yet been 
reported from other Lower Mississippi regions, even where there has been 
intensive investigation.” Furthermore, they went on to say, “it is illogical to 
think that the Tensas Basin would have been completely ignored at the same

time that the Yazoo was receiving considerable attention across the river. Nev¬ 
ertheless, no artifactual evidence relating to Cahokia was reported for the for¬ 
mer during the course of two field seasons of survey and test excavation con¬ 
ducted by the LMS in 1963 and 1964” (Williams and Brain 1983:412). If 
confirmed, the presence of Cahokian imports at the Lake Providence Mounds 
would indicate that the influence of the American Bottom polities was also 
felt in the Tensas Basin of Louisiana. 

Sourcing Analyses 

To confirm the likelihood that the apparent American Bottom sherds truly 
came from that area of the country, a small sample of both the local clay- 
tempered ware and the potentially exotic ceramics was submitted for sourcing 
analyses (Table 3.1). A petrographic analysis of 37 thin-sectioned sherds and 
two pieces of fired clay from Lake Providence was conducted by James B. 
Stoltman of the University of Wisconsin, and portions of these same samples 
then were sent to the University of Missouri’s Research Reactor Facility 
(MURR) where Enrique Rodriguez-Alegria and his colleagues conducted in¬ 
strumental neutron activation analysis (INAA). 

Using point-counting techniques, Stoltman (2005) found that all of the 
clay-tempered sherds produced statistically identical indices, and he came to 
the conclusion, as suspected, that these probably represented locally produced 
pottery. Also as suspected, Stoltman found that the Powell Plain pottery iden¬ 
tified at Lake Providence matched very well with examples from the American 
Bottom. Surprisingly, Stoltman further suggested that all of the other shell- 
tempered sherds in the sample, including all specimens of Mississippi Plain, 
had a nonlocal but probable common origin. Thus, they also could have come 
from a far-off region, perhaps from Mississippian sites located in Arkansas, 
northern Mississippi, or Missouri, having traveled to Lake Providence by the 
same means that brought the American Bottom vessels to the site. 

The data collected by neutron activation allowed Rodriguez-Alegria et al. 
(2005) to group the sherds into three clusters on the basis of their chemical 
signatures. Groups 1 and 2 overlapped to a significant degree and were con¬ 
sidered to represent locally made pottery. Signatures that fell outside these 
groups were usually classified as “unassigned.” A third group of Lake Provi¬ 
dence sherds was assigned to MURR’s provisional Cahokia-Halliday group, 
a tentative formulation based on ongoing research on American Bottom col¬ 
lections. Two shell-tempered sherds were assigned to this chemical group. 

Petrographic and neutron activation analyses agreed that 19 of the 37 sherds 
submitted for analysis were locally made (see Table 3.1). They further agreed

that seven of the 37 sherds were nonlocal and that two of these imports were 
manufactured in the American Bottom area. Taken together, the two sourc¬ 
ing studies, particularly the thin-section analysis, suggest that the potential 
American Bottom sherds found at Lake Providence likely originated in that 
region, probably during the Stirling 2 (ca. a.d. 1150-1200) or Moorehead 1 
(ca. a.d. 1200-1250) phase (Figure 3.15). However, the predominance of brown 
filming on the sherds of Powell Plain from Lake Providence, as well as the 
absence of Cahokia Cord Marked, suggests that a Stirling 2 date may be more 
likely (Milner 1984:166). Recognizable rims at Lake Providence also include 
forms common to the Stirling 2 phase (see Pauketat i998b:Figures 7.27, 7.28, 
7.31, and 7.32). Thus, contact with the American Bottom region (presumably 
including the great mound center at Cahokia) probably occurred at Lake 
Providence during the earlier half of the Preston phase component at the site 
or roughly sometime between a.d. 1150 and 1200. This is in keeping with 
several other locales in the LMV, where sherds attributable to the so-called 
Cahokia horizon have been found (Brain 1969, 1989: McNutt 1996:237-238; 
Williams and Brain 1983:409-412). 

Lake Providence and the Evolution of the Mississippi Period Elite 

The “conservative and introverted character” (Williams and Brain 1983:410) 
of Coles Creek society has often been noted (Kidder 1992a; Wells 1998). 
While some Weeden Island-related decorative styles and a number of Plum 
Bayou rim forms are found in Coles Creek sites in the Tensas Basin, Coles 
Creek ceramics prior to a.d. 1000 exhibit a very limited number of extrare- 
gional contacts and influences (Fuller et al. 1995:129-136; Hally 1972; Kidder 
1990b, 1993a; Wells 1998; see also Williams and Brain 1983). This apparent 
parochialism has been interpreted as a sign that the incipient elite of Coles 
Creek societies preferred not to (or was not allowed to) participate in extrare- 
gional trade networks. This may reflect the organization of early Coles Creek 
society; the low degree of social ranking probably prevented the incipient 
elite from exercising the prerogatives that later elites were to enjoy (Kidder 
i992a:i56; Nassaney 1991:195-196; Wells 1998). 

As the Coles Creek period approached its last two or three centuries (Bal¬ 
moral and Preston phases), however, it seems evident that some changes were 
beginning to take place. Substantial programs of mound construction contin¬ 
ued, often following the standard Coles Creek three-mound site plan. How¬ 
ever, several sites with five or more mounds also appeared. This suggests a 
two- or three-tiered program of settlement in some areas, consisting of small 
hamlets and possibly two levels of mound settlement (Wells 1997). Limited

numbers of trade goods appear in Balmoral phase contexts (Kidder 1990b), 
and the first corn is found in the Tensas Basin during this phase. A distinctive 
fineware (Vicksburg paste) makes its first significant appearance, albeit in mi¬ 
nor amounts (2 to 4 percent in Tensas Basin sites; Hally i972:Table 28). Cerami¬ 
cally, this paste may be one of the strongest indicators of special-function, 
proto-elite activity (Ryan 2004:248). The bulk of pottery, however, is still 
made on a Percy Creek/Valley Park -like paste. Exotic designs are rare, and im¬ 
ported ceramics are virtually unknown from the phase. 

The terminal Coles Creek period dramatically amplifies this trend of social 
change. Larger villages appear that may suggest an extra tier in the settlement 
hierarchy below the level of mound site (Kidder 1993a; Wells 1997). Corn 
increased its presence in Preston phase contexts, although it had yet to reach 
the levels found in Plaquemine phases (Kidder 19933:26). If the Lake Provi¬ 
dence site is any indication of the constitution of elite activities in the Tensas 
Basin, however, one of the most dramatic changes in social differentiation and 
material culture may be seen in the ceramic containers used in high-status 
contexts. The presence of a “Preston fineware complex” has already been 
noted in the midden atop Mound E and in most other locations at the Lake 
Providence Mounds. This complex consists of Carter Engraved, Vicksburg, 
and related decorated varieties and the fine shell-tempered wares Powell Plain, 
Ramey Incised, Mississippi Plain, var. Coker, and their red-filmed counter¬ 
parts. Sherds identified as Powell Plain and Ramey Incised appear to be de¬ 
rived from the American Bottom. Their presence adds even more significance 
to this exotic-looking assemblage. 

Ryan (2004:248) notes an increase in hnewares at Hedgeland and other 
sites during the Balmoral phase. While observing that hnewares (in this case, 
represented by sherds with Baytown Plain, var. Little River paste) were used 
for a limited number of vessels in early Coles Creek contexts, she points out 
that the percentages of fine clay-tempered pottery double during the Bal¬ 
moral phase. She attributes this to the rise of an elite by the end of the Coles 
Creek period, a segment of society that required an expression of their status 
and social/ceremonial responsibilities through the use of well-made pottery. 
The numbers of imported goods evident in late Coles Creek contexts at 
Hedgeland indicate an increase in external contacts as well, although the Ca- 
hokian imports appear to be missing from this site. Instead, Ryan takes the 
presence of bone-tempered Morris Plain and possible limestone-tempered 
sherds (Unclassified Plain at Hedgeland) to indicate Caddoan and/or eastern 
contacts (Ryan 2004:248-249). 

It is tempting to view the sudden increase in external contacts and trade 



RECENT DATA FROM THE LAKE PROVIDENCE MOUNDS 


6l 


goods at terminal Coles Creek mound sites in the LMV as causal in the evo¬ 
lution of the Plaquemine-Mississippian elite. Certainly, Brain (1989) and Wil¬ 
liams and Brain (1983:409-412) have cited Cahokian contact as one of the 
primary forces behind the “Mississippianization” of Coles Creek societies. 
However, the evolution of the incipient Coles Creek elite probably has its 
roots in the Baytown and early Coles Creek periods with the initial construc¬ 
tion of platform mounds. These mounds were not intended for communal 
burials as they were in Baytown period (Troyville culture) sites. Instead, they 
represent an elaboration of mortuary ceremonialism (Kidder and Wells 1992). 
This change marked the gradual exclusion of the overall community from 
some aspects of ceremonial life and the beginning of an increasingly important 
role of a limited number of people in ritual activities. Steponaitis (1986:386), 
Kidder (1992a), Knight (1986), and Wells (1998) have postulated that it was 
primarily this co-option of ceremonial roles, not economic activities, that led 
to the rise of the Mississippi period elite. Certainly, the Coles Creek period 
saw a gradual but steady increase in the amount of mound construction at 
many Tensas Basin sites, a sign that central direction or control of labor was 
increasing from the Mount Nebo to the Preston phases (Wells 1997, 1998). 
This is an indication that the evolution of centralized power and the rise of 
the elite in Coles Creek society were taking place well before trade and exter¬ 
nal contact became factors. Therefore, these external contacts and the appar¬ 
ent monopolization of trade goods should be seen as signs that an existing 
elite segment of Coles Creek society was beginning to exercise its power more 
widely. These ongoing, indigenous processes probably have far more to do 
with the rise of the subsequent Plaquemine elite than the presence of a few 
trade goods in sites dating to the end of the Coles Creek sequence. 

As for the “Mississippianization” of the Tensas Basin, it does not seem 
likely that the succeeding Plaquemine phases of the area really derived much 
of their Mississippian leanings from Cahokian contact. The established Mis¬ 
sissippi period phases within the Tensas Basin appear to be direct descendants 
of Coles Creek ceramic traditions (Kidder 1993a). Any Mississippian influ¬ 
ences appear to be derived from sustained contact with middle Mississippi 
period (Winterville and Lake George phase) peoples in the Yazoo Basin and 
areas to the north. The lone exception is the Transylvania phase, believed to 
date largely to the late end of the Mississippi period sequence (Hally 1972). 
Transylvania does contain a large, truly Mississippian shell-tempered assem¬ 
blage and may represent the intrusion of groups from outside the Tensas Ba¬ 
sin. Surface collections from the Rose Hill (Panola Mounds) site just to the 
northwest of Lake Providence appear to be derived from true Routh phase 



62 


WELLS AND WEINSTEIN 


deposits and contain very few shell-tempered sherds (Hally i972:Table 25). 
Thus, it appears that the local sequence was largely unaffected by contact with 
the powerful American Bottom chiefdom (or chiefdoms). 

Although Cahokian contact may not have left a permanent impression on 
the local cultural sequence, there is clearly a Mississippian presence in the 
Preston phase assemblage at Lake Providence. Just over three percent (n = 6 25) 
of the sherds from this site are shell tempered and the wares they came from 
may have been produced by foreign potters. There are two primary explana¬ 
tions of how these sherds came to be part of the assemblage at Lake Providence. 
The first relies solely on trade, particularly from the north and especially with 
the American Bottom. Certainly, one of the strategies of an emerging elite is 
the manipulation of both exotic goods and the new ideologies they represent. 
There is often prestige attached to the exotic and mystical elements of other 
cultures, which can be translated to prestige for the manipulator of said ele¬ 
ments (Bishop 1987; Earle 1991; Helms 1993; Wells 1998). On a less ethereal 
level, control over the exchange of essential raw materials, such as stone, and 
superior finished goods may also play a role (Nassaney 1992; Redmond 1996). 

A second theory to explain the presence of exotic and exotic-looking ce¬ 
ramics involves a combination of trade for finished goods and the physical 
presence of Mississippian potters. A certain number of these shell-tempered 
pots were probably imported into the site, particularly the examples of Ramey 
Incised, Powell Plain, and Old Town Red, var Cahokia. However, many of 
the sherds of shell-tempered pottery may not be imported, as suggested by 
INAA. These sherds are very clearly not within the tradition of Coles Creek 
pottery. There are, however, sherds of var. Greenville and associated varieties 
(such as var. Carter) that exhibit both shell and grog tempering. This combi¬ 
nation suggests that local potters were being influenced in their manufactur¬ 
ing techniques by Mississippian methods of pot construction, adding small 
amounts of shell to their grog-tempered repertoire. A likely explanation for 
this is the actual presence of a few Mississippian potters who were producing 
vessels in their own tradition. This would probably have involved the ex¬ 
change of women (the most likely candidates for prehistoric Native American 
potters) or perhaps the presence of “war brides” or slaves taken in raids. Cer¬ 
tainly, the appearance of wall-trench structures at Lake Providence argues for 
a more extensive Mississippian presence than could result from indirect, 
down-the-line trade contacts. 

Although Lake Providence has one of the largest samples of shell-tempered 
pottery from this time level in the LMY, it is not likely that the current data 
can be used to convincingly support either of the above hypotheses. The small 



RECENT DATA FROM THE LAKE PROVIDENCE MOUNDS 


63 


percentage of these shell-tempered sherds suggests neither a “site-unit intru¬ 
sion” of Mississippian peoples nor heavy contact between the cultures. Simple 
exchange might be an explanation, although the presence of shell-and-grog- 
tempered pottery in the terminal Coles Creek levels at Lake Providence and 
at sites in the Lower Yazoo Basin does imply more sustained communication 
between potters. Ceramic data alone are probably not adequate to evaluate 
these hypotheses; other lines of evidence, particularly mortuary data, are 
needed to help establish the presence or absence of Mississippian peoples, as 
well as the nature of the contact. Unfortunately, these analyses will have to 
await future projects, as there are no data currently at hand to answer these 
questions. 

Conclusions 

Testing and data-recovery operations at the Lake Providence Mounds have 
yielded a wealth of information relating to the beginnings of Plaquemine cul¬ 
ture in northeast Louisiana. In addition to feature and structure patterns, the 
site has produced a large number of artifacts that shed light on social devel¬ 
opment at the terminal end of the Coles Creek sequence. To date, it appears 
that the imported ceramics at Lake Providence are among the only examples 
of Cahokian pottery to be found in the southern LMV outside of the Yazoo 
Basin. 

Certainly, recent programs of similar intensity undertaken at mound cen¬ 
ters such as Osceola (Kidder 1990b), Raffman (see Roe, this volume), and 
Hedgeland (Ryan 2004) have not encountered these imported shell-tempered 
types in Preston phase contexts. Despite this, Lake Providence shares a closely 
related assemblage of artifacts with these other sites, an assemblage that 
clearly belongs to the Preston phase. All four sites share a multiple-mound- 
and-plaza plan and a robust program of mound construction. In all prob¬ 
ability, it is Lake Providences unique position at the northern end of the Ten¬ 
sas Basin, close to the Mississippi River and mound centers in the nearby 
Yazoo Basin, that constitutes the primary difference. This proximity probably 
afforded the emergent Lake Providence elite access to the Cahokian goods. 
While this access may have given these elites a few quality exotics to bolster 
their positions within the local sphere of influence, shell-tempered types re¬ 
tained a minor position in the Tensas Basin until the late Mississippi period. 
It is difficult to argue that contact with full-blown Mississippian societies to 
the north during terminal Coles Creek times had a substantial impact on 
succeeding generations. 

While Ian Brown, in this volume, has questioned the ancestral relationship 



64 


WELLS AND WEINSTEIN 


of Coles Creek and Plaquemine culture bearers in the Natchez Bluffs region, 
there seems to be little doubt about this relationship in other areas. This is 
particularly true for the Tensas Basin, as expressed at Lake Providence. Tradi¬ 
tional Coles Creek ceramic varieties appear alongside Plaquemine ceramics 
and have consistent associations with imported shell-tempered varieties. All 
of these, of course, are minority wares included in a larger Preston phase as¬ 
semblage, which often features Plaquemine decorative techniques on a non- 
Addis ware. These associations suggest a strong continuity between the native 
Coles Creek potters and their Plaquemine successors. 

One thing is certain, however—the late Coles Creek residents of the upper 
Tensas Basin were not as parochial as many once believed. They clearly had 
contact with other groups farther to the north in the heartland of the Missis- 
sippian world. The terminal Coles Creek occupation at the Lake Providence 
site provides a clear break with the rather provincial tendencies of earlier Coles 
Creek phases, in which evidence of extraregional contact and interaction gen¬ 
erally is lacking. The Preston fineware complex is predominantly associated 
with mound-top activities associated with the upper echelon of Preston soci¬ 
ety. The fact that much of the fineware at Lake Providence can be tied to sites 
in the American Bottom region adds even more significance to this complex. 
How and why these exotics came to Lake Providence, whether directly down 
the Mississippi River or through intermediate centers such as Winterville and 
Lake George, is still unknown.

Plaquemine Mounds of the Western 
Atchafalaya Basin 

Mark A. Rees 


When the Louisiana State Archaeological Survey began digging into the 
Medora mounds on the west bank of the Mississippi River in the winter of 
1939, Plaquemine was just a small river town around the next bend, thought 
to have been named for the wild persimmons that grew along the riverbanks 
(Riffel 1985:32). The cultural tradition of the people who built the mounds at 
Manchac Point was yet to be defined, only vaguely conceived on the basis of 
surface collections as “either . . . late Coles Creek or . . . that of an unformu¬ 
lated period that followed Coles Creek but. . . older than Natchezan” (Quimby 
1951:91). While James Ford (e.g., 1951:13) intended Plaquemine to serve along¬ 
side Coles Creek as a typological construct in his chronology of Lower Mis¬ 
sissippi Valley (LMV) ceramics, it was not long before its identification as a 
period, a culture, and even a phase was recognized as problematic, particularly 
in relation to more expansive Coles Creek and Mississippian traditions (e.g., 
Cotter I952a:i24-i25; Willey 1966:308). 

Phillips (1970:950) effectively isolated (or “reduced”) Plaquemine culture 
as represented by the Medora phase in his most influential work, while sub¬ 
sequent research upriver redefined the problem of Plaquemine origins in 
terms of “hybridization”—an admixture of indigenous Coles Creek and sub¬ 
sequent exogenous Mississippian influence (Brain 1989:122; Rees and Livin- 
good, this volume; Williams and Brain 1983:414). The Lower Yazoo Basin and 
Natchez Bluffs would thus be seen as focal points of Coles Creek-Plaquemine 
“transculturation” or at least the “geographical center of Plaquemine culture” 
(Brain 1978:332, 1989:122; Brown 198512:251, this volume). The southern delta 
and vast flood basin to the west have consequently been regarded as “periph¬ 
eral, or marginal” to mainstream Plaquemine development (Gibson 1975:28), 
a point of view ostensibly supported by relatively less-spectacular earthen

mound sites and a paucity of ceramic evidence for formative Mississippian 
influence (Duhe 1981; Mclntire 1958; Weinstein 1987a). Of course, these dif¬ 
ferent perspectives have influenced and in turn reflect disparate theories of 
Plaquemine origins and development (Rees and Livingood, this volume). 

Setting aside questions of cultural origins and influence, it is also possible 
to approach Plaquemine peoples from a combined political and historical per¬ 
spective, in terms of regional political culture. The most obvious comparisons 
to be made here are with contemporaneous Mississippian polities to the north 
and east, although apparent similarities with earlier Coles Creek polities 
should not be ignored. Acknowledging the pitfalls of typological constructs 
such as the chiefdom (e.g., Cobb 2003:65; Earle 1987:279-281), it is reasonable 
to conceive of Plaquemine culture in terms of regional polities of various geo¬ 
graphic scales in the LMY, each interacting on different levels at different 
points in time between circa a.d. 1200 and 1700. With this in mind, we turn 
to the flood basin on the southwest edge of the LMV to examine the evidence 
for the political culture of Plaquemine peoples, as represented in numerous 
mound sites. It will then be possible to revisit the problem of cultural origins 
and consider whether it is accurate or even useful to conceive of polities in the 
western Atchafalaya Basin as peripheral to Plaquemine culture. First, however, 
a little background is in order. 

Archaeology in the Atchafalaya Basin 

The Atchafalaya Basin in south-central Louisiana is a complex network of 
bayous, bottomlands, natural levees, swamplands, flood basins, and backwater 
lakes on the southwest edge of the LMY From Old River north of Simmes- 
port to Atchafalaya Bay west of the Terrebonne Basin, the Atchafalaya River 
is today a major distributary of the Mississippi and Red rivers. Covering ap¬ 
proximately 3,800 square miles, the surrounding Atchafalaya Basin is the 
“largest major division of the deltaic plain” (Saucier 1994:30). While it has 
long been renowned for its prolific wildlife, archaeologists have only just be¬ 
gun to explore the history of human occupation in the region. The basin is 
made up of deltaic plain alluvium deposited during the mid to late Holocene 
(7000-3000 b.p.) and the river became a distributary of the Mississippi as 
recently as five centuries ago (Autin et al. 1991:561-564; Saucier 1994:30-31, 
284-286; Smith et al. 1986:45, 49-56). The Atchafalaya Basin has been in¬ 
creasingly influenced by human modifications, resulting in large-scale envi¬ 
ronmental transformations during the past century. Central to these efforts 
have been the system of levees and the Old River control station that restrict 
the volume of water entering the Atchafalaya from the Mississippi. Knowl-

edge of site geomorphology in such a dynamic and rapidly changing land¬ 
scape is essential in understanding human habitations during the past millen¬ 
nium, particularly the Mississippi period (Autin et al. 1991:561-564; Gagliano 
1984; Reuss 2004; Saucier 1981:16-17). 

The present study encompasses that portion of the basin west of the main 
channel of the Atchafalaya River and east of the Prairie Terrace and Chenier 
Plain of southwest Louisiana. It includes the Teche Ridge, a former Missis¬ 
sippi River meander belt (Saucier 1994:278-280). This is the traditional home¬ 
land of the Chitimacha, described by Swanton (1911:337-360) as living in vil¬ 
lages along Bayou Lafourche, Bayou Teche, and Grand Lake by the early 
eighteenth century. Little has been published regarding the Chitimacha prior 
to the eighteenth century, yet they are generally recognized as among the de¬ 
scendants of Plaquemine populations (Jeter 1989:242; Kniffen et al. 1987:53, 
230; cf. Neuman 1984:278; Weinstein i987a:ioi). Plaquemine components are 
far more numerous than Mississippian in the study area and the mound sites 
discussed here are culturally affiliated with the present-day Chitimacha Tribe 
of Louisiana (Gibson 1990:105-107). The cultural landscape has remained 
somewhat obscure archaeologically, perhaps owing in part to characterizations 
of the natural environment as a backwater (Gibson 1975:28,1976:20, i978a:44). 
A brief overview of previous investigations serves to demonstrate an even 
more compelling reason that the region as a whole has been portrayed as cul¬ 
turally marginal. 

During the late winter and early spring of 1912-1913 the now legendary 
steamboat the Gopher plied the Atchafalaya River and Bayou Teche, carrying 
avocational archaeologist C. B. Moore to little-known Indian mound sites 
hidden along the muddy banks. Moore (1913:9-21) mentions seven mound 
sites in the study area, although he investigated only four in the most cur¬ 
sory fashion (16SL2, 16SMY2, 16SMY10, and possibly 16SM2). Describing 
his investigations as an “unproductive task” and finding few of the spectacular 
artifacts he encountered at other mound sites, Moore’s attention was soon 
drawn elsewhere (Moore 1913:7; Weinstein et al. 2003:126-144, Appendix 
A-3). In the decades following Moore’s expedition some of the same mound 
sites were briefly visited by Collins (1927), Kniffen (1938), and Mclntire (1958). 
Groundbreaking research to the north and east meanwhile contributed to the 
formation of a culture historical framework and nomenclature that would in¬ 
fluence subsequent investigations throughout the southeastern United States 
(e.g., Belmont 1967; Ford 1935a, 1936,1951,1952; Ford and Webb 1956; Quimby 
1951,1957). Of particular importance were excavations by the Louisiana State 
Archaeological Survey at Medora on a natural levee of the Mississippi River

immediately east of the Atchafalaya Basin (Quimby 1951; see also Quimby 
1957). Although little work was attempted in the western Atchafalaya Basin 
during this time, surface collections from some sites were sufficient to ht 
within a broad culture chronology (e.g., Phillips 1970:920-923, 950-954). 

A new era of archaeology began in the basin in the 1970s, accompanied by 
the arrival of university archaeologists and the growth of cultural resource 
management (CRM). Jon Gibson (1976, 1978a, 1979, 1982, 1990), with the 
University of Southwestern Louisiana, now the University of Louisiana at 
Lafayette, surveyed portions of the basin and Teche Ridge (see Neuman 
2002:90-91). Under the direction of Ian Brown (1978,1979,1980,1981,1982b, 
1984), the Lower Mississippi Survey extended the scope of its investigations 
to Avery Island and the Petite Anse region of coastal Louisiana (Brown and 
Lambert-Brown 1978; Brown et al. 1979). Among the sites investigated were 
late Coles Creek, early Plaquemine, and Mississippian components at Salt 
Mine Valley (16IB23) on Avery Island (Brown and Lambert-Brown 1979) and 
at Morgan (16VM9), a Coles Creek mound site in coastal Vermilion Parish 
(Brown 1981; Fuller and Fuller 1987). 

The Atchafalaya Basin Archaeological Survey at Louisiana State University 
(LSU) picked up where C. B. Moore left off, documenting mound sites that 
had otherwise escaped the attention of archaeologists (Neuman and Servello 
1976). Described by Neuman and Servello (1976:71) as the “first systematic 
investigation of archaeological sites in the region,” their survey consisted of 
background research, brief site visits, and surface collections (see also Gagliano 
1967, 1984; Gagliano et al. 1975; Neuman 1972,1977). Also during the 1970s, 
James Springer (1973, 1977, 1980) produced detailed studies of Coles Creek 
ceramics and subsistence from excavations at the Bruly St. Martin (16IV6) 
mound site in the eastern Atchafalaya Basin south of Baton Rouge. 

Since the 1980s archaeologists employed in CRM have examined numerous 
mound sites in the basin (e.g., Gibson 1982; Goodwin et al. 1985; Goodwin et 
al. 1991b; Kelley et al. 2000; Manning et al. 1987; Santeford et al. 1995; Shu¬ 
man 1985; Vigander and Maygarden 1994; Wells 2001). Many of these surveys 
dealt only indirectly with mound sites. Jones and Shuman (1987,1991) mapped 
and performed surface collections at mound sites in a portion of the study 
area, producing some of the first maps of sites that had been known about for 
a century or more. Creation of a regional program within the Louisiana Di¬ 
vision of Archaeology (LDA) provided stimulus for additional studies, includ¬ 
ing Mike Russo’s (1992,1993) work at the Baker (16SM19) and Stelly (16SL1) 
sites (Russo and Fogleman 1996). Regional archaeologists continue to visit and 
record sites (e.g., McGimsey 1995,1998, 2001; Mann 2001, 2002). By the late 



70 


MARK A. REES 


1990s Plaquemine components were known for many of the mound sites in 
the western Atchafalaya Basin. Yet there had been no concerted program of 
research aimed specifically at examining the timing of mound construction 
and site occupations, potential contemporaneousness of various sites, or re¬ 
gional political economy. 

In short, prior to the 1970s archaeological research in the Atchafalaya Basin 
as a whole was characterized more by general overviews and decades-long pe¬ 
riods of inactivity than by any particular systematic or intensive program of 
study (Gibson 19783:27, 1979:29; Kelley et al. 2000:9-10; Wells 2001:7-8). 
Since then the pace of research has escalated within the context of CRM and 
university-based investigations, yet it has involved few detailed studies of 
Plaquemine mound sites. Current understanding of Plaquemine societies of 
the Atchafalaya Basin as marginal to a Plaquemine “heartland” is consequently 
as much a reflection of the data sets available to archaeologists as it is a meas¬ 
ure of supposed cultural associations. The dearth of information ultimately 
raises questions concerning Plaquemine origins and the notion of a heartland 
or cultural center. The Medora site, after all, where Plaquemine was con¬ 
ceived, is located only 40 km (25 miles) east of the study area (Quimby 1951). 

Taking into account the ongoing risks of site destruction, the Plaquemine 
Mounds Archaeological Project (PMAP) was designed as a means of redress¬ 
ing the need for additional study of mound sites in the western Atchafalaya 
Basin. Earthen mounds are today still the most visible features of Native 
American sites and their study presents an opportunity to examine the timing 
and scale of regional political development and decline. During the first year 
of PMAP investigations (2003-2004) background research and reconnais¬ 
sance surveys were conducted in order to identify mound sites with possible 
Plaquemine components. A total of 80 mound sites were identified through a 
search of the available literature and the LDA site file database, encompassing 
portions of St. Landry (31 sites), Lafayette (6 sites), St. Martin (17 sites), Iberia 
(12 sites), and St. Mary (14 sites) parishes. These represent known or pre¬ 
viously recorded mound sites; sites as yet unrecorded may potentially remain, 
and some sites may have been destroyed without ever having been recorded. 
Due to the vagaries of early site recording it is sometimes unclear whether an 
earthen mound, shell midden, or both mound and midden are present at a 
site. Terms such as shell mound and earth midden do not adequately distin¬ 
guish intentionally constructed mounds from transposed, primary contexts 
resulting from accretional midden formation. Furthermore, insufficient data 
are presently available from many sites to make such distinctions. 

Several of the above mound sites were recorded in only cursory fashion and

have subsequently been flattened or destroyed. The number of obliterated 
mounds has grown steadily since the nineteenth century, including at least 
one presumably lost to coastal erosion and others having been leveled in agri¬ 
cultural fields. The Pharr or Fairview Plantation site (16SMY148), near the 
town of Berwick, consisted of two mounds when visited by Collins in 1926 
(McGimsey 2001:124-125). When revisited in July 2003 residential develop¬ 
ment had recently encroached where the mounds once stood. In the case of 
Berwick Mounds (16SMY184), across the Atchafalaya River from present-day 
Morgan City, four large mounds in a quadrilateral layout were described by 
James Cathcart in 1819 and subsequently destroyed before ever having been 
investigated or adequately documented (Prichard et al. 1945). Any investiga¬ 
tion of mound sites in the region must consequently take into account the 
void created by site destruction, filled in when possible by studies of intact 
deposits. 

On the basis of the preliminary results of the PMAP investigation, there 
are 23 mound sites with known or suspected Plaquemine components in the 
study area, including those with mounds partially or largely destroyed. This 
number includes multicomponent sites and reflects a likelihood for mixed de¬ 
posits or ephemeral Plaquemine occupations at mound sites dating from 
Coles Creek (ca. a.d. 700-1200) and earlier periods. Assessment of site com¬ 
ponents is in many instances problematic given the uneven nature of earlier 
investigations, often consisting of only brief surface inspections or unsystem¬ 
atic surface collections. More well-known sites such as Lafayette (16SM17) 
and Meche-Wilkes (16SL18), thought to date from the Tchefuncte period, can 
be excluded from further consideration (Ford and Quimby 1945; Gibson 
1990:81-85; Melancon 1999). The majority of mound sites with Plaquemine 
components are thought to have one or two mounds, some of which are lo¬ 
cated in the vicinity of larger mound sites. 

Association of mound sites with historic Chitimacha villages in the LMY 
has received relatively little attention (but see Giardino 1984 for the Missis¬ 
sippi delta). Drawing upon Gatschet (1883, 1907) and Chitimacha sources, 
Swanton (1911:337-344) was instrumental in identifying village locations. In 
reviewing the archaeological and historical data, Gibson (1978b, 1980) as¬ 
sessed the possible locations of more than 36 villages dating from as early as 
1702. The paucity of documentary sources has been exacerbated by a lack of 
reliable archaeological information, including investigations that might con¬ 
firm whether specific sites were occupied during the eighteenth century. Many 
of the mound sites in question may have initially been constructed five or 
more centuries prior to the earliest documentary evidence of Chitimacha vil- 



72-

lages. Reoccupation or reuse of mound sites is consequently a possibility, fur¬ 
ther complicating matters of cultural affiliation at multicomponent sites (e.g., 
Mann 2005). While tentative at best, correlation of mound sites with known 
Chitimacha villages nonetheless represents an attempt at making historical 
connections between the archaeological record, descendant populations, and 
their living traditions (i.e., Lightfoot 1995; Trigger 1980). 

The remainder of this chapter summarizes what is presently known about 
six of the extant major Plaquemine mound sites in the western Atchafalaya 
Basin, drawing upon the results of recent PMAP investigations (Figure 4.1). 
Three of these sites can be associated with known Chitimacha villages, al¬ 
though it is uncertain at present whether the names referred to the mound 
complexes, nearby (or neighboring) villages, or both. This is followed by a 
discussion of regional chronology, settlement patterns, and political culture, 
including the implications of this study for Native American culture history 
in the LMV. Moving from north to south, the sites to be considered are 16SL3, 
16SL20, 16SM38, 16SM5 (fli'pinimtc namu), 16SMY2 (OktYnkiskin), and 
16SMY10 (Qiteet Kuti'ngi na'mu). 

16SL3 

Site 16SL3 is located on a terrace overlooking the south bank of a bayou that 
flows in an easterly direction toward its former confluence with the Atcha¬ 
falaya River, approximately 8.9 km (5.5 miles) to the east. An abandoned 
course of the Mississippi-Teche meander lies 1 km (0.6 miles) to the west 
(Saucier i994:Plate 11). The mounds at 16SL3 are among the most impressive 
and best preserved of any in the study area (Figure 4.2). Surprisingly, these 
appear to have escaped the attention of archaeologists until the early 1970s 
(LDA Site File, 16SL3). The PMAP crew visited the site in April 2004 in order 
to produce a contour map and collect core samples from the mounds. Four 
rectangular platform mounds are positioned in a linear arrangement along the 
bayou, covering an estimated 3.6 ha (8.8 acres). The site may be much larger, 
however, considering the potential areas of habitation around the mounds. 
Mound A, the largest in the group, lies farthest east. It is approximately 4.8 
m (15.7 feet) high with basal dimensions covering approximately 3,600 m 2 
(38,750 square feet). Mounds B and C are approximately 3.6 and 3.3 m high, 
respectively, and are slightly smaller in size but appear to be multistage plat¬ 
forms. Possible ramps on the north slopes of Mounds A and B suggest an 
orientation toward the bayou rather than a centrally located plaza (Jones and 
Shuman 1991:49-57). 

Mound C is distinguished from the other mounds in having what appears

to be a small conical mound on its northern summit. Depressions in the 
spaces between Mounds A, B, and C have been interpreted as borrow pits, 
although the mounds appear to have been constructed on low ridges separated 
by natural swales. Mound D is the westernmost mound and located farthest 
south of the bayou. In fact, the distance between this mound and the other 
three raises questions as to whether it was constructed contemporaneously and

how it might relate to the rest of the mound complex. Mound D is a low-lying 
platform mound 1.8 m (6 feet) high, the smallest in height of the four mounds. 
The summit of Mound D is conspicuously level and larger than that of any 
of the other mounds, indicating its likely use as a substructural platform. A 
ravine has been dug into the west slope of Mound D and partially filled in 
with debris. The mounds at 16SL3 are otherwise in good condition, with only 
slight evidence of pot hunting, damage from off-road vehicles, and erosion. 

Both Coles Creek and Plaquemine components have been identified at 
16SL3 on the basis of unsystematic surface collections and a small-scale sal¬ 
vage excavation in Mound A. Unprovenienced pottery sherds reported from 
the site include Avoyelles Punctated, var. Dupree, Coles Creek Incised, vars. 
Hardy and Coles Creek, Evansville Punctated, var. Sharkey, French Fork In¬ 
cised, var. French Fork, Harrison Bayou Incised, var. unspecified, Indian Bay 
Stamped, var. unspecified, Mazique Incised, var. Manchac, Plaquemine Brushed, 
var. Plaquemine, and Pontchartrain Check Stamped. Projectile point types in¬ 
clude Alba, Bayou Goula, and Seaborn (Jones and Shuman 1991:59). Excava¬ 
tion of 60 cm of disturbed soil within a i-by-2-m unit placed over a tree fall 
on the summit of Mound A in 1998 produced a small collection of Coles 
Creek Incised, Harrison Bayou Incised, Pontchartrain Check Stamped, and 
undecorated pottery sherds (McGimsey 1998:87-89). Following Neuman and 
Servello (1976:23), Jones and Shuman (1991:62) suggest 16SL3 may represent 
a “classic Coles Creek occupation.” Mound construction might just as plau¬ 
sibly date from the Mississippi period given the pottery types recovered from 
Mound A. A village area and associated midden have yet to be identified at 
the site. Without radiometric dates or diagnostic artifacts from controlled, 
stratigraphic contexts it is difficult to add much more. 

16SL20 

The second mound site of interest is located on the south bank of a south¬ 
easterly flowing bayou approximately 800 m (0.5 miles) northwest of its con¬ 
fluence with a smaller bayou in St. Landry Parish. Less is known about this 
site than any in the study area, perhaps in part because of its relatively remote 
location 5.5 km (3.4 miles) west of the main channel of the Atchafalaya River. 
The site was originally described as having three mounds arranged in a trian¬ 
gular pattern and a fourth located at some distance to the southeast (LDA Site 
File, 16SL20). 

Mounds A, B, and C have been described as rectangular platforms rang¬ 
ing in height from 1.2 to 3.7 m (4—12 feet). Mound D is a low rise approxi¬ 
mately 0.6 m in height and 63 m southeast of Mound A. Jones and Shuman 



7 6 


MARK A. REES 


(1991:124-128) described the site layout as a quadrilateral or diamond with the 
short axis (64 m or 210 feet) running between the two largest mounds, A and 
C, and the long axis (128 m or 420 feet) between Mounds B and D. The area 
enclosed by the mounds is estimated to cover 0.98 ha (2.4 acres). Extensive 
pot hunting has been reported at the site and it has never been systematically 
investigated (LDA Site File, 16SL20). 

Site 16SL20 has been described as a late Coles Creek center on the basis of 
the layout of the mounds and a few small surface collections that consisted 
mostly of undecorated and Pontchartrain Check Stamped sherds (Jones and 
Shuman 1991:129). A surface collection by the Louisiana southwest regional 
archaeologist in 1992 included mostly Baytown Plain, var. unspecified sherds 
(n = 22) and one sherd of Plaquemine Brushed (LDA Site File, 16SL20). On 
the basis of this and earlier surface collections it has also been associated with 
Plaquemine culture (Neuman and Servello 1976:24; Prentice 2000:274). Little 
more can be said about 16SL20 without further investigation. 

16SM38 

In contrast, more is presently known about 16SM38 than any other mound 
site in the study area as a result of a series of field school investigations by the 
University of Louisiana at Lafayette (Everett et al. 2002; Gibson 1990; Rees 
2002, 2003). The site is located on a natural levee of the Mississippi-Teche 
meander, on the south bank of a bayou that flows easterly into crawfish ponds 
and a modern canal (Saucier 1994:279). Prior to these landscape alterations 
and construction of the west Atchafalaya protection levee, the bayou would 
have flowed more directly into the Atchafalaya River approximately 12 km 
(7.5 miles) to the east. The low-lying area immediately surrounding the site is 
subject to periodic flooding and does not appear to have been historically 
cultivated. Although it was not mentioned by Moore (1913) or Neuman and 
Servello (1976:27), Phillips (1970:920-923, 950-95i:Figures 446, 447) associ¬ 
ated 16SM38 with both the Coles Creek Bayou Cutler phase and the sub¬ 
sequent Medora phase. 

Six earthen mounds were initially identified, positioned around a centrally 
located plaza and surrounded by a series of shallow depressions, some of 
which have been interpreted as borrow pits (Figure 4.3). Mound A is the larg¬ 
est in both area and height, at approximately 4 m (13 feet) higher than the 
surrounding terrain. As a consequence of off-road vehicle traffic, pot hunting, 
and erosion it is estimated to have been reduced in height by at least 0.5 m. 
Mound A is conical in shape and connected to Mound B by a low causeway 
or ramp. Mounds C and D are similarly joined on the western side of the

plaza. Mound D, the second largest in the group, is the only mound that ap¬ 
pears to have been a rectangular platform. Two low rises, designated Mounds 
E and F, are positioned on the south edge of the plaza but may actually rep¬ 
resent midden deposits, perhaps similar to two small mounds at the Green¬ 
house site (Ford 1951:101-102; Kidder 199813:139). Additional similarities with 
Greenhouse include the paired layout and general orientation of four mounds 
(Rees 2002). A seventh small mound was recently identified approximately 
200 m northeast of Mound A. Mound G lies in a wooded area outside of the 
main mound complex and its potential association with the other mounds is 
uncertain. 

Excavations at 16SM38 indicate that the site extends well beyond the 
mound-and-plaza complex, with midden accumulation around Mounds A, B, 
and C. The entire site is conservatively estimated to cover at least 3 ha (7.4 
acres) on the basis of the recovery of artifacts from 50-by-50-cm test units 
during the winter of 2001-2002. Trench walls excavated into two erosional 
gullies in Mound A revealed intact mound deposits, basket loading, and a 
thick layer of slope wash. A core placed through the summit of Mound A 
revealed two distinct episodes of mound construction above a pre-mound sur¬ 
face. Pottery sherds recovered from excavation units during the 1998, 2001, 
and 2003 field schools are classified primarily as Baytown Plain (78 to 88 per-

cent). Among the decorated pottery, the most common types are Pontchar- 
train Check Stamped, Plaquemine Brushed, Mazique Incised, and several va¬ 
rieties of Coles Creek Incised. Other decorated types include Avoyelles Punc¬ 
tated, Evansville Punctated, Harrison Bayou Incised, and L’Eau Noire Incised. 
Two Scallorn or Colbert-like projectile points were recovered along with one 
Alba point during the 2003 field school, further indication of a multicompo¬ 
nent, Coles Creek-Plaquemine habitation. 

Site 16SM38 is at present the most precisely dated mound site in the study 
area (Table 4.1). Wood charcoal from a small hearth (Feature 1) northeast of 
Mound A first investigated during the 2001 field school returned a radiocar¬ 
bon age of 620 + 70 b.p. (UGa-10994). Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) 
analysis of two wood charcoal samples from midden excavated in the vicinity 
of Feature 1 yielded radiocarbon ages of 690 ± 40 b.p. (Beta-190916) and 860 
± 40 b.p. (Beta-190917). Calibrations for these samples and the one from Fea¬ 
ture 1 are consistent with the overall stratigraphic sequence and produce cal¬ 
endar age ranges spanning circa a.d. 1040-1483 (Beta-190917, Beta-190916, 
and UGa-10994). AMS analysis of wood charcoal from a pre-mound surface 
beneath Mound A produced a radiocarbon age of 850 ± 40 b.p., indicating 
that construction of Mound A likely postdates circa a.d. 1212 (UGa-10995). 
This corresponds very closely with one of two previous radiocarbon ages ob¬ 
tained for charred materials from the lowest stratum of mound fill in Mound 
B, at 850 ± 70 b.p. (Beta-127975). A second radiocarbon age of 560 ± 70 b.p. 
was more recent, but in the context of mound fill provides no more reliable 
indication of the actual time of mound construction (Beta-132764; Everett et 
al. 2002:9; McGimsey and van der Koogh 2001:6-7). On the basis of these 
results the habitation northeast of Mound A appears to date from the early 
thirteenth through the late fourteenth centuries, with the construction of 
Mounds A and B likely dating sometime after a.d. 1200. This corresponds 
with the excavated assemblages of decorated pottery and confirms an early 
Plaquemine habitation. Given the substantial inclusion of Coles Creek pot¬ 
tery types in mound fill, there also appears to be a sizable Coles Creek com¬ 
ponent. 

16SM5 (Hi'pinimtc Na'mu) 

hike the aforementioned sites, 16SM5 is located on a bayou that flows easterly 
into the Atchafalaya Basin, entering Fake Fausse Pointe through Fake Dau- 
terive. Association of this site with the Chitimacha village of Hi’pinimtc 
na’mu is far from certain but proposed here as one plausible scenario requiring 
further scrutiny. Drawing upon Gatschet (1883) and Chitimacha sources,

MARK A. REES 


Swanton (1911:344) described the location of Hi'pinimtc na'mu or “Prairie¬ 
landing village” as being “on the western part of Grand Lake, at Fausse Pointe, 
near Bayou Gosselin” (see also Brightman 2004:643). Swanton adds that an¬ 
other village of the same name was located “on Lac d’Autre Rive, between 
Charenton and St. Martinsville.” Site 16SM5 is 8.0 km (5 miles) from Little 
Gonsoulin Bayou but in fact near Lake Dauterive. Although this is hardly a 
ringing endorsement for the identification of Fli'pinimtc na'mu, a Chitimacha 
village was likely in the vicinity. The Chitimacha Tribe of Louisiana maintains 
oral histories regarding the use and symbolism of the mounds at 16SM5. It is 
believed to have been the location of a sacred tree marking the boundary of 
the Chitimacha homeland (LDA Site File, 16SM5; Kim Walden, personal 
communication, 2002; cf. Swanton 1911:354). Llistoric villages of the Chiti¬ 
macha are also thought to be located across the bayou to the south (McGim- 
sey 1995:8-10). An association between 16SM5 and one of two villages re¬ 
ferred to as Fli'pinimtc na'mu is therefore one reasonable interpretation (cf. 
Gibson 1978^14). 

Site 16SM5 is located on a natural levee dissected by several low-lying 
swales and a minor, intermittent drainage (Figure 4.4). Although these chan¬ 
nels accentuate the height of the mounds, it is unknown whether they predate 
mound construction or represent intentional modifications to the landscape. 
Three earthen mounds are laid out in a triangular arrangement around a bend 
in the bayou. Mound A is approximately 2.6 m (8.5 feet) high with a south¬ 
easterly sloping summit and roughly rectangular shape. It is bounded on the 
south by the bayou and on the west by an intermittent channel. Mound B is 
located 25 m (82 feet) northeast of Mound A and is approximately 1.2 m (3.9 
feet) high. At around the same height, Mound C lies 50 m (164 feet) east of 
Mound B. The shapes of mounds B and C are difficult to discern at present 
but they appear to have been platforms. A low ridge extends from the south¬ 
east slope of Mound C, turning westward along the bank of the bayou. The 
bayou demarcates the southern edge of what appears to be a centrally located 
plaza, enclosing an estimated area of 0.5 ha (1.2 acres). 

Two low-lying, intermittently water-filled areas east and west of Mound B 
may represent borrow pits. Connected by shallow channels and intermittent 
drainages to the bayou on the south, the mound-and-plaza complex seems to 
be nearly entirely surrounded. Llowever, it is unknown whether these gullies 
and low-lying areas are cultural features associated with mound construction. 
An extensive shell midden lies outside of the mound-and-plaza arrangement, 
across a shallow gully northeast of Mound C. The midden extends for at least 
50 m (164 feet) along a natural levee overlooking the bayou and exhibits high

concentrations of pottery sherds, bone, and shell. The site is conservatively 
estimated to cover 1.3 ha (3.2 acres) but may have originally been much larger 
before having been impacted by nearby road construction. Each of the mounds 
and the midden exhibit signs of extensive pot hunting. 

Given the size and location of this site it is somewhat surprising that it was 
not mentioned by Moore (1913) or Neuman and Servello (1976). Mclntire 
(i958:Plates 7a, 7b, 10, 12, and 13) described it as a Coles Creek site with a 
small collection of Pontchartrain Check Stamped and Mazique Incised pot¬ 
tery sherds. Phillips (1970:920-923, Figures 446 and 447) subsequently asso¬ 
ciated this site with the Coles Creek Bayou Cutler phase. More recent surface 
collections suggest both Coles Creek and Plaquemine components. McGim- 
sey (1995:8-10) recorded decorated pottery types such as Coles Creek Incised, 
vars. Blakely, Coles Creek, Curtis, Hunt, Keogh, Manchac, and Mazique, Pont¬ 
chartrain Check Stamped, L’Eau Noire Incised, Churupa Punctated, var. 
Churupa, and Hollyknowe Pinched (LDA Site File, 16SM5). Decorated ce¬ 
ramics noted on the surface of the midden and west of Mound A during the 
2003 PMAP investigation included small sherds of Carter Engraved, Harri¬ 
son Bayou Incised, Mazique Incised, Plaquemine Brushed, var. Plaquemine,

Pontchartrain Check Stamped, var Pontchartrain, and French Fork Incised, 
var. Larkin. 

Two AMS dates were obtained from core samples taken from Mound A 
and the shell midden at 16SM5. The first consisted of wood charcoal in sedi¬ 
ment from a sub-mound A horizon, at 2.66-2.73 m below surface (Beta- 
190914, Table 4.1). The radiocarbon age was 1210 ± 40 b.p., merely indicating 
a terminus post quem for the construction of Mound A. The second sample 
consisted of one shell (Rangia cuneata) specimen from 10 cm below the surface 
of the midden. It produced a radiocarbon age of 730 ± 40 b.p. (Beta-190915). 
This generally corresponds with three radiocarbon dates more recently ob¬ 
tained for samples excavated from two i-by-i-m units in the midden. Two 
samples of wood charcoal near the bottom of the midden yielded radiocarbon 
ages of 1260 ± 50 b.p. (Level 6, Beta-200908) and 1460 ± 40 b.p. (Level 7, 
Beta-200909). The third produced a similar radiocarbon age of 1270 ± 50 b.p. 
for charcoal from Level 3 (Beta-201513). Several small, shell-tempered pottery 
sherds were recovered from the upper levels of one test unit, lending support 
to the later radiocarbon age of 730 ± 40 b.p. for a more recent and perhaps 
terminal midden deposit (Beta-190915, 2-sigma cal a.d. 1240-1300). As at 
16SM38, these dates indicate a multicomponent or transitional Coles Creek- 
Plaquemine habitation, in this case spanning seven centuries between circa 
a.d. 600 and 1300. Of course, this does not rule out the possibility that the 
historic Chitimacha village of Hi pinimtc na'mu was subsequently located 
here or in the vicinity. 

16SMY2 (Oku'nkTskTn) 

On the basis of Chitimacha sources, Swanton (1911:344, 352) described the 
village of Oku'nkiskin (“deep-shoulder”) on Grand Lake, a short distance 
from the town of Charenton (Teat KasLtuncki). The Chitimacha Tribe of 
Louisiana recognizes 16SMY2 as the village of OkuTikiskin (LDA Site File, 
16SMY2). Another possibility is that 16SMY2 was the nearby village known 
as Ama’tpan na’mu (Brightman 2004:643-644; Gibson 197813:15, 1982:458- 
459; cf. Swanton 1911:343; Weinstein et al. 2003:140-141). Surprisingly little is 
actually known about the mounds at 16SMY2 despite the site’s having drawn 
the interest of scholars throughout the past century (e.g., Collins 1927:201; 
Gibson 1982:450-459; Kniffen 1938:194; Mclntire i958:Plate 5b; Moore 1913: 
19-21; Neuman and Servello 1976:29, 64; Phillips 1970:920-923, 950-951; 
Prentice 2000:274; Swanton 1911:344, 352). It was one of the few mound sites 
in the study area visited by C. B. Moore (1913:19-21), due no doubt to the

site’s high visibility and accessibility on Grand Lake. Moore (1913:19) de¬ 
scribed the site as “five mounds composed largely of shell” but found little of 
interest there, perhaps because most of the mounds were planted in sugar cane. 

Henry Collins, assistant curator of ethnology at the U.S. National Mu¬ 
seum, visited the site in 1926 at the request of the Bureau of American Eth¬ 
nology and U.S. National Museum. He was accompanied to the site by 
Benjamin Paul, Chief of the Chitimacha. Collins described the site as con¬ 
sisting of three earthen mounds and an extensive shell midden. He excavated 
a test pit into one mound that he described as eight feet high (Collins 1927; 
McGimsey 2001:114, 125-126). Mclntire (i958:Plates 5a, 5b, 7b, 8b, 13) sub¬ 
sequently described the site as having Troyville, Coles Creek, and Plaquemine 
components on the basis of surface-collected pottery. Phillips (1970:920-923, 
950-951, Figures 446 and 447) associated 16SMY2 with the Coles Creek 
Bayou Cutler phase and Medora phase of the Mississippi period. 

Oku'nkiskm may at one time have consisted of as many as six mounds and 
shell midden in linear arrangement along Grand Lake. It has been heavily 
impacted by road construction and recreational development. The shell mid¬ 
den had already been damaged by the time of Collins’s visit and is today 
nearly obliterated. Beginning on the western edge of the site, Mound A is a 
circular earthwork that has been damaged by modern landscape renovations. 
Mound B was destroyed by construction of a boat landing and access road. 
Mound C lies east of mounds A and B and may have been the focus of inves¬ 
tigations by Moore (1913) and Collins (1927). Mound D is a large, rectangular 
platform approximately 3 m in height. It is the largest of the existing mounds 
at the site but has been impacted by a ditch that cuts across the northern 
slope. Mounds E and F, recorded during a site visit in 1997, are low rises ad¬ 
jacent to a remnant of the shell midden (LDA Site File, 16SMY2; McGimsey 
2001:86,125-126; Weinstein et al. 2003:141). 

Based on Collins’s brief visit, McGimsey (2001:125) suggests a Coles Creek 
component associated with Mound C. The pottery in this collection consists 
of a few sherds of Baytown Plain, Coles Creek Incised, vars. Blakely, Green¬ 
house, and Pecan, Plaquemine Brushed, var. Plaquemine, Mazique Incised, var. 
Manchac, and one sherd each of Pontchartrain Check Stamped, var. Pontchar- 
train, Evansville Punctated, var. Rhinehart, Carter Engraved, var. Shell Bluff, 
L’Eau Noire Incised, var. unspecified, French Fork Incised, var. McNutt, and 
Beldeau Incised, var. Bell Bayou. Plaquemine and historic Chitimacha com¬ 
ponents are also indicated on the basis of these pottery types, historic docu¬ 
mentation, and oral histories (LDA Site File, 16SMY2).

MARK A. REES 


16SMY10 (Qiteet Kuti'ngi Na'mu) 

The final site to be considered here is recognized by the Chitimacha Tribe of 
Louisiana as the village of Qiteet Kuti’ngi na’mu (Jason Emery, personal com¬ 
munication, 2003; McGimsey and Cring 2003:184). It is located on the north 
bank of Bayou Teche near a former confluence with the Atchafalaya River, 
subsequently diverted by levee construction. On the basis of conversations 
with Chief Benjamin Paul, Swanton (1911:344) referred to the village of “Tca'ti 
Kuti'ngi na'mu, at junction of Bayou Teche with Bayou Atchafalaya.” Gatschet 
(1883) mentioned this village as well, although since the confluence of the 
Teche and Atchafalaya has changed over the years it is unclear whether Tca'ti 
Kuti'ngi na'mu was located at 16SMY10 or farther downstream near Morgan 
City (McGimsey and Cring 2003:208). Brightman (2004:643) refers to the 
same site as “Chad kutingi namu” but places it at the Atchafalaya River and 
Bayou Courtableu. While the issue is far from resolved, 16SMY10 is referred 
to here by the Chitimacha designation Qiteet Kuti'ngi na'mu. As discussed 
below, recent research confirms an eighteenth-century Native American pres¬ 
ence at the site. 

C. B. Moore (1913:19) appears to have briefly visited this location and de¬ 
scribed two large mounds, 13 feet and 10.5 feet in height, “in full view from 
the water [Bayou Teche]” (Weinstein et al. 2003:141-143). Moore had his crew 
dig into these mounds but found little of interest, except for the skeletal re¬ 
mains of one individual, which had previously been damaged by looters. In¬ 
discriminate digging and erosion appear to have already severely truncated 
the larger of the two mounds by the time of Moores visit. It was this mound, 
according to Moore (1913:19), that was “connected with a shell ridge on the 
eastern side, formed almost entirely of a variety of clam-shell, Rangia cuneata, 
and midden deposit extending along the bank of the river.” In all, Moore 
spent less than three hours at the mounds “at Moro plantation.” 

Because the site was originally recorded in 1952 as a ceremonial center con¬ 
sisting of “four mounds and a shell midden,” the identification of 16SMY10 
with the mounds at Moro plantation is not certain (LDA Site File, 16SMY10). 
However, it is possible that Moore missed two of the smaller mounds (Wein¬ 
stein et al. 2003:142-143). If so, the larger mound described by Moore as at¬ 
tached to a shell ridge and midden may have been destroyed soon thereafter, 
perhaps as a result of continued bank erosion and/or the excavation of a nar¬ 
row channel or boat slip. Mclntire and Saucier recorded the site as a ceremo¬ 
nial center with Coles Creek, Plaquemine, and historic components (LDA Site 
File, 16SMY10). Mclntire (1958:79) later referred to an initial Coles Creek

occupation on the basis of its location on the Teche Ridge. However, his pot¬ 
tery tabulation also included later types such as Fatherland Incised, Australia 
Interior Incised, and Plaquemine Brushed (Mclntire 1958:128, Plate 13). Phil¬ 
lips (1970:920-923, 950-951, Figures 446 and 447) associated the site with the 
Bayou Cutler, Medora, and Delta Natchezan phases (cf. Neuman and Servello 
1976:64-65). Collections in the LSU Museum of Natural Science include 
Anna Incised, vars. Anna and Australia, Coles Creek Incised, vars. Blakely, 
Hardy, and Pecan, French Fork Incised, vars. Larkin, McNutt, and Lafayette, 
Harrison Bayou Incised, var. Harrison Bayou, Mazique Incised, var. Mazique, 
Plaquemine Brushed, var Plaquemine, and Pontchartrain Check Stamped, 
var. Pontchartrain (McGimsey and Cring 2003:187, Table 14.1). The site was 
revisited in 1991 as part of a larger survey of the lower Bayou Teche and again 
described as four earthen mounds with a shell midden (Goodwin et al. 1991a; 
Goodwin et al. 199111:103-105; LDA Site File, 16SMY10). 

In December 2003 the PMAP investigation recorded three earthen mounds 
and a linear shell midden extending along the bank of the bayou (Figure 4.5). 
Mound A, the largest extant mound at the site, is approximately 2.8 m (9.2 feet) 
in height and 30 m (98 feet) in diameter. Mound B is located 25 m (82 feet) 
to the northeast and is approximately 2.4 m (7.9 feet) high. The south slope 
of Mound B appears to have been sharply truncated from the summit to the 
base. Although Moore (1913:19) noted similar damage at Moro plantation, it 
was in reference to the larger mound located “nearer the bayou.” Since this is 



86 


MARK A. REES 


not an accurate description of Mound A, it once again raises the possibility 
that a fourth mound adjacent to the midden was subsequently obliterated. 
Mounds A and B appear to have included platforms, although the precise 
shapes are difficult to establish as a result of sustained damage from pot hunt¬ 
ing, off-road vehicles, and erosion. Mound C, located 30 m southeast of 
Mound B, is more noticeably a rectangular platform. It is approximately 
0.8 m (2.6 feet) in height but may have been conflated by years of cultivation 
and erosion. The shell midden extends along the bank of the bayou from 10 m 
(33 feet) southeast of Mound A nearly to the southwest slope of Mound C. 
The existence of a fourth mound could not be confirmed during the PMAP 
study, despite several attempts at coring an area of higher elevation on the 
western edge of the midden. 

The contour map indicates ramps may have extended from the northeast 
slope of Mound A and southwest slope of Mound B. Along with Mound C, 
the mounds appear to be positioned around a centrally located plaza, with the 
midden making up the southern boundary. The area enclosed by the mounds 
and midden is approximately 0.44 ha (1.09 acres) and the overall site size is 
conservatively estimated at 1.2 ha (2.97 acres). However, this does not include 
potentially inhabited areas outside of the mound group subsequently im¬ 
pacted by modem development. An associated village was reportedly de¬ 
stroyed by a large, modern borrow pit to the north (Goodwin et al. 1991b; 
Neuman and Servello 1976:29, 64). It is unknown whether this area or the 
mound group itself would have been the location of the Chitimacha village 
of Qiteet Kuti'ngi na'mu. 

The PMAP investigations support successive Coles Creek, Plaquemine, 
and historic habitations at 16SMY10. Cores were placed through each of the 
mounds and the midden, from which two samples were submitted for radio- 
metric analysis. The first consisted of shell (Rcmgia cuneata) fragments from 
27-50 cm beneath the surface of the midden (Beta-190918). The resulting 
radiocarbon age was 1210 ± 50 b.p. (2-sigma cal a.d. 1290-1450), in concur¬ 
rence with the ceramic evidence for an early Plaquemine occupation. The 
second sample consisted of wood charcoal from beneath the lowest layer of 
fill in Mound A. AMS analysis yielded a radiocarbon age of 1010 ± 40 b.p. 
(Beta-190919, 2-sigma cal a.d. 980-1050 and cal a.d. 1100-1140). It is there¬ 
fore probable that construction of Mound A was most likely begun sometime 
after a.d. 1020, perhaps coinciding with a terminal Coles Creek or transitional 
Coles Creek-Plaquemine habitation. 

Recent investigations shed new light on the association of 16SMY10 with

the Chitimacha village of Qiteet Kuti'ngi na'mu, referred to by Swanton 
(1911:344) as Tca'ti Kuti'ngi na'mu. A site inspection in July 2003 yielded evi¬ 
dence of exposed human remains and artifacts eroding from the north slope 
of Mound A. A partially damaged burial in one of several off-road vehicle 
paths was in imminent danger of destruction. Personnel from the LDA, Chi¬ 
timacha Tribe of Louisiana, and PMAP conducted a salvage excavation with 
permission from the landowner and a permit issued by the Louisiana Un¬ 
marked Human Burial Sites Board. Subsequent analysis indicated the pri¬ 
mary interment of a 3-year-old child with numerous grave goods dating be¬ 
tween a.d. 1763 and 1820. The burial offerings consisted of both indigenous 
items and trade goods, such as black, white, and blue glass beads (McGimsey 
and Cring 2003:200-205). Pottery sherds recovered from disturbed mound fill 
consisted of Baytown Plain, var. unspecified. Carter Engraved, var. Sara, and 
Larto Red, var. unspecified. Although the burial likely postdates initial mound 
construction by several centuries or more, it supports either historic reuse of 
the mound precinct or continued inhabitation in this locale potentially asso¬ 
ciated with the village of Qiteet Kuti'ngi na'mu. 

Discussion 

Several observations can be drawn from the preceding description of sites. 
First and foremost is the paucity of information on even the largest mound 
sites in the region. While some sites have been known about for a century or 
more (e.g., 16SMY2 and 16SMY10), others have until relatively recently gone 
virtually unnoticed by archaeologists (e.g., 16SL3 and 16SL20). Site destruc¬ 
tion from indiscriminate digging, off-road vehicles, and erosion in many in¬ 
stances continues unabated, highlighting the critical need for additional in¬ 
formation on extant mound sites. The PMAP has begun to document such 
poorly known sites by producing topographic maps, conducting systematic 
coring, and carrying out small-scale test excavations. Only two of the six sites 
discussed here have been systematically investigated in any detail (16SM38 
and 16SM5). 

Second, greater temporal and spatial resolution regarding mound construc¬ 
tion and use, site habitation, potential abandonment, and reuse are needed in 
order to provide tighter chronological controls for a more refined culture his¬ 
tory of the western Atchafalaya Basin. Third, combined with studies of ma¬ 
terial culture and subsistence, information on the construction, layout, and 
locations of mound sites has the potential to significantly advance our under¬ 
standing of regional polities during the late Coles Creek and Mississippi pe-

riods (ca. a.d. 1000-1700). The present study has intriguing implications con¬ 
cerning the last two issues: regional chronology and Native American politi¬ 
cal culture. 

Chronology building does not in itself explain social or political dynamics, 
a point emphasized in earlier processualist critiques of a culture historical ap¬ 
proach (e.g., Binford 1968; Flannery 1967). Yet archaeologists have more re¬ 
cently recognized that refinement of regional chronologies is fundamental to 
understanding political development and decline (e.g., Knight and Steponaitis 
1998; Pauketat 1995). Advancement from cultural periods to phases and sub¬ 
phases in Mississippian archaeology has been characterized by more nuanced 
distinctions regarding regional political economy, allowing for considera¬ 
tion of human agency alongside long-term ecological factors (Pauketat 1997a, 
1997b, 1998a). The gist of this approach has been to rearticulate the pre- 
Columbian, Native American past as a historical process (e.g., Pauketat 2001a, 
2001b). The relevance of historical processualism, besides taking into account 
Native American cultural traditions, contradictions, diversity, and practices as 
agents of change, is in bridging the formidable protohistoric transformations 
of escalating contacts and colonialism (Lightfoot 2001; Wesson and Rees 2002). 

The PMAP has so far contributed only to the preliminary advancement of 
a regional chronology for the western Atchafalaya Basin. Earlier studies have 
hinted at a centuries-long hiatus in the occupancy of the western margin of 
the LMV prior to the Coles Creek period (Gibson 1990:25; see Phillips 1970: 
Figures 444 and 445). On the basis of the series of radiometric dates presented 
here, it appears that initial construction and habitation of major mound cen¬ 
ters dates from the late Coles Creek and early Mississippi periods, or what has 
been called the Coles Creek-Plaquemine transition (i.e., Weinstein 19873:87- 
93). Eight of 13 available radiometric dates from three sites have calibrated 
calendar ranges within a.d. 1025-1483, with intercepts clustering between 
a.d. 1190 and a.d. 1405 (Table 4.1). The remaining dates are associated with 
sub-mound contexts, representing a terminus post quem for mound construc¬ 
tion at 16SM5 and 16SMY10 (Beta-190914 and Beta-190919) and a Coles 
Creek context for the initial midden deposit at 16SM5. The argument for 
Plaquemine culture as representing Mississippianized Coles Creek finds little 
support at 16SM5, where mound construction seems to have been preceded 
by two centuries of habitation and any evidence for interaction with Missis¬ 
sippian societies appears to have been late and ephemeral. 

While additional dates are urgently needed from these and other sites, the 
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries stand out as a time when Plaquemine 
peoples, including ancestors of the Chitimacha, were building large earthen

mounds that may have served as political-administrative and ceremonial cen¬ 
ters. Arguments regarding the contemporaneous or successive establishment 
of these centers will require further refinement of a regional chronology. 

Issues regarding cultural affiliation come into view at the other end of the 
chronology. While the importance of documentary evidence and oral histories 
has long been realized in establishing the locations and cultural affiliations of 
sites in the LMV (e.g., Giardino 1984), there is much archaeology that re¬ 
mains to be done. In particular, compelling associations of the Chitimacha 
Tribe of Louisiana with three of the sites mentioned here indicate the poten¬ 
tial for multidisciplinary research into mound building, reuse, and the persist¬ 
ence of traditions in the face of momentous demographic, political, and eco¬ 
nomic change (e.g., Mann 2005). The investigation of eighteenth-century 
villages and potential associations with mound centers represents a virtually 
untapped source of information on Chitimacha history spanning the Missis¬ 
sippi and early historic periods. 

It may be no coincidence that the best-known sites are those located far¬ 
thest south, within the homeland of the Chitimacha Tribe of Louisiana. Ar¬ 
chaeological and ethnographic evidence for protohistoric or early historic 
habitation, while sparse, is restricted at present to these sites (16SM5,16SMY2, 
and 16SMY10). This raises questions regarding the construction, reoccupa¬ 
tion, and reuse of mound sites that essentially demarcate the western bound¬ 
ary of the Chitimacha homeland. Given the relatively later habitations at 
these southernmost mound sites, perhaps sites to the north such as 16SL3 and 
16SL20 correspond to the frontier of a yet earlier, ancestral Chitimacha home¬ 
land. A creation myth of the Chitimacha is purported to recount their origin 
in the vicinity of the Natchez (Swanton 1911:348, 356), with whom they have 
been compared and contrasted (e.g., Griffin 1952:363; Kniffen et al. 1987:53- 
55). Additional refinement of a regional chronology is also necessary in order 
to evaluate such propositions and will undoubtedly assist in establishing clearer 
connections between archaeological, ethnographic, and historical sources. 

Information on the timing and scale of mound and village construction 
also has the potential to inform our understanding of regional political cul¬ 
ture. Large political-administrative centers elsewhere in the Southeast were 
characterized by demographic nucleation and decentralization concurrent 
with the development and decline of regional polities. Six major multimound 
sites with known or suspected Plaquemine components were constructed at 
fairly regular intervals along the western margin of the Atchafalaya Basin, 
ranging in distance from 22.9 km (16SM38 to 16SM5) to 28.9 km (16SL3 
to 16SL20), the mean straight-line distance being approximately 26.4 km 



90

(16.4 miles). If distance or travel time between centers can be used to gauge 
the scale of political organization, as has been argued for Mississippian poli¬ 
ties (e.g., Hally 1993,1999), one might be tempted to draw inferences regard¬ 
ing the multimound sites discussed here. Of course, estimates of travel time 
must ultimately take into consideration the efficiency of water transport, es¬ 
pecially in the LMV. Arguments for a series of contemporaneous or consecu¬ 
tive polities will also ultimately require refinement of the regional chronology 
introduced here. 

The fact that four of the northernmost mound centers were located on 
major east-west drainages suggests political and economic interactions fo¬ 
cused consistently around the regional transport and exchange of resources 
and information between the basin and Teche Ridge, rather than a single, 
regionally integrated polity. If the latter were the case, one might expect a 
strategic arrangement of mound centers along the Teche Ridge, taking advan¬ 
tage of both the higher elevation and the bayou as a major north-south trans¬ 
portation route. Yet surprisingly few mound centers are accordingly posi¬ 
tioned (e.g., 16IB40 and 16SMY10). Instead, site placement suggests an overall 
east-west orientation in the cultural landscape, once more resembling the his¬ 
toric boundaries of the Chitimacha homeland and potentially indicating a 
borderland with ancestral Attakapa of the Prairie Terrace and perhaps other 
Coles Creek, Plaquemine, and Mississippian communities of the southwest 
Louisiana Chenier Plain (Swanton 1911:360-363). Did Plaquemine peoples, 
including ancestors of the Chitimacha, establish a half-dozen autonomous or 
loosely allied polities on the western edge of the Atchafalaya Basin prior to the 
fourteenth century? In order to answer such questions it will be necessary to 
collect additional information on the timing of mound construction and evi¬ 
dence for contemporaneous habitation. Whether these centers were built and 
inhabited in close succession or at different times, the data seem to indicate 
the shifting or movement of regional political culture. By examining the tim¬ 
ing of mound construction and midden deposition it will be possible to more 
thoroughly address the pace and scale of regional political development. 

Lastly, ideas concerning dispersed settlement patterns and ceremonial cen¬ 
ters must also be reexamined, particularly in light of the midden deposits 
noted at sites such as 16SM38, 16SM5, and 16SMY2 (Neuman 1984:260). Of 
the sites discussed here, none straightforwardly correspond to what might be 
thought of as a “typical” design for a Plaquemine ceremonial center (Kidder 
1998^141-148; cf. Neuman 1984:258-268; Quimby 1951). Rectangular plat¬ 
forms, conical mounds, causeways, shell middens, and ridges were incorpo-

rated in a variety of arrangements, including linear alignments along bodies 
of water (16SL3 and 16SMY2), quadrilaterals with centrally located plazas 
(16SL20,16SM38, 16SMY184), and triangular patterns with the addition of a 
low ridge or midden (16SM5 and 16SMY10). Interpreting site layout and de¬ 
sign as the cumulative result of intentional actions rather than merely accu¬ 
mulative deposition or accretional processes, it is possible to form general 
inferences regarding the social import of monumental architecture and cere¬ 
monial spaces (e.g., Knight 1998; Wesson 1998). The existence of social tem¬ 
plates or archetypal patterns for mound groups and ceremonial spaces is sug¬ 
gested by similarities among the above sites, as well as between 16SM38 and 
the Greenhouse site in Avoyelles Parish (Ford 1951). The meanings of these 
archetypes are not entirely beyond the grasp of archaeologists, in that the built 
environment effectively represents the materialization and negotiation of so¬ 
cial identities (Lewis et al. 1998). 

Similarities between sites 16SM5 and 16SMY10, ostensibly associated with 
the Chitimacha villages of Hipinimtc na'mu and Qiteet Kuti'ngi na'mu, 
might thus be viewed as diagrammatic of comparable community organiza¬ 
tions. Substructural mounds corresponding to residential and mortuary pre¬ 
cincts of the nobility, as noted among the Chitimacha, would have been de¬ 
signed, constructed, and administered by corporate groups or lineages (LDA 
Site File, 16SM5; Swanton 1911:348-351). The higher ranking or elite of Chiti¬ 
macha society are reported to have comprised endogamous lineages. Mar¬ 
riages in such cases have been considered ethnographically to create “new 
alliances among equals” or maintain existing social inequalities, particularly 
in the context of land tenure (Comaroff and Comaroff 1991:138-140; Wolf 
1959:228). Following exhumation and ceremonial bundling in the hana katci' 
or “bone house,” the remains of a Chitimacha chief and his possessions were 
interred in a mound. According to Swanton (1911:351), “the mounds erected 
over chiefs are said to have been 4 or 5 feet high.” 

In view of this ethnographic analogy and the available archaeological evi¬ 
dence, it seems ill-advised to portray the western Atchafalaya Basin as a cul¬ 
tural backwater to the Plaquemine heartland of the Natchez Bluffs or Yazoo 
Basin. From the perspective of Coles Creek—Mississippian hybridization, 
inhabitants of the western Atchafalaya Basin may appear to have been left 
behind, with clearer connections to Coles Creek in terms of both mound 
complexes and pottery; shell-tempered sherds are nearly nonexistent in the 
assemblages from major mound sites discussed here. Even from the viewpoint 
of indigenous Coles Creek development, most of the mound sites discussed 



92

here appear lacking in size and grandeur (except perhaps for 16SL3), particu¬ 
larly in comparison with large Coles Creek mound centers such as Raffman 
(Roe, this volume). 

From a regional, political perspective, the mound groups of the western 
Atchafalaya Basin take on new meanings. Blitz and Livingood (2004:299) 
point out that the size or volume of Mississippian platform mounds is a reflec¬ 
tion of both duration of use and political power or authority, as well as the 
mobilization of labor in different social contexts. To equate the magnitude of 
mound complexes with comparative cultural prominence seems ill advised, 
particularly for a region in which so little is known concerning the social 
contexts of mound construction and use. Mound centers are representative of 
historical processes of political consolidation, alliance formation, shifting 
authority, and ultimately the movement of peoples across a cultural landscape. 
In understanding the societies that constructed mounds in the western Atcha¬ 
falaya Basin, it will be more productive to frame new findings not as marginal 
to Coles Creek or Plaquemine culture but in terms of regional political cul¬ 
ture, as a historical process that produced living traditions such as the Chiti- 
macha.

Despite the criticisms of the New Archaeologists about the use and implica¬ 
tions of the taxonomic systems employed by culture historians (e.g., Binford 
and Binford 1966), the effective use of taxonomic terminology has continued 
to be a problem. There are several reasons for this. At least with regard to the 
Lower Mississippi Valley, Belmont (1982b:69-70) suggested the problem has 
been simple confusion among archaeologists, which has led them to use many 
taxa interchangeably. This confusion is at least partly the result of the inability 
of investigators to decide among themselves what the various terms mean. Just 
as important, however, are the limitations inherent in the way culture histori¬ 
ans go about their work. 

Regardless of the criticisms leveled at them by processualists and their suc¬ 
cessors, the major figures in southeastern archaeology have long been aware 
of the problems they faced with their approaches. Willey and Phillips at¬ 
tempted to resolve some of the issues with their evolutionary synthesis in 1958. 
The junior author, in the introduction to his monumental work on the archae¬ 
ology of the Yazoo Basin, admitted to being unabashedly “old fashioned” in 
stating that such theory as he proposed to employ “is in fact little more than 
‘method.’” Phillips gently criticized such theoreticians as Ford who, in at¬ 
tempting to derive laws of cultural change, “make certain assumptions. . . 
that are in effect the laws he is trying to deduce” (Phillips 1970:3). 

To Phillips, then, our tools are deficient, but at the present they are the only 
tools we have. This is especially problematic when we try to extend our ter¬ 
minology spatially: “So long as we are forced to operate with the mixed culture- 
chronological criteria inherent in our ‘culture periods,’ it is more important 
that these be locally intelligible than that they be capable of expansion across 
the board” (Phillips 1970:8). This, then, highlights one of the problems this 



NORTHWEST LAKE SALVADOR, ST. CHARLES PARISH

chapter will address. Let us now consider the meanings commonly ascribed 
to the terms Coles Creek, Plaquemine, and Mississippian. 

The term Coles Creek in archaeology derives from the landmark work of 
James A. Ford (1936), who analyzed collections from Louisiana and Missis¬ 
sippi. In that work Ford refers to Coles Creek as a ceramic complex. Thereafter, 
he and Willey, in one of the first syntheses of eastern archaeology, call it a 
period defined on the basis of ceramic traits (Ford and Willey 1941:345). At 
that time the Coles Creek period was thought to have lasted until the middle 
of the sixteenth century (Ford and Willey 1941:346). Since that time, besides 
being described as a period (Phillips 1970), it has also been described as both 
a period and a culture (Williams and Brain 1983:369, 405), a hyphenated cul¬ 
ture, linked to the preceding Troyville (Neuman 1984), and an interval (Wein¬ 
stein and Kelley 1992:351). Central to all these is the notion of a set of ceramic 
characteristics, although since the time of Ford other diagnostic traits have 
been added, such as site features and plans and overall settlement patterns 
(Williams and Brain 1983:405). As regards ceramics, Coles Creek is recogniz¬ 
able by “the use of incised, stamped, and punctated pottery types in which 
the decorative zone is largely restricted to a band around the rim of the vessel” 
(Weinstein and Kelley 1992:37). Architecturally, Coles Creek sites often con¬ 
sist of small platform mounds centered on plazas (Weinstein and Kelley 
1992:37). The heartland for Coles Creek is the mouth of the Red River and 
the Lower Yazoo Basin (Miller et al. 2000:44), though it eventually extended 
to the coastal areas. The dates conventionally accepted for Coles Creek in 
south Louisiana are a.d. 700-1200 (Weinstein i987a:86). 

The concept of Plaquemine derives from the work of Quimby (1951) at the 
Medora site in west Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana. As Neuman (1984:258) 
writes, little about Plaquemine is distinctive. However, he notes that, besides 
the decorative technique of brushing as applied to ceramics, other apparent 
characteristics are “the occasional use of shell to temper the clays; small pro¬ 
jecting lug handles on the vessel rims; engraving; and the general absence of 
stamped designs” (Neuman 1984:259). Most Plaquemine sites contain at least 
two rectangular mounds, but the number of mounds may be as many as 24, 
centered on two plazas (Neuman 1984:259). It goes almost without saying that 
the term Plaquemine, like Coles Creek, has been ascribed to varying taxonomic 
units (see Miller et al. 2000:44), though probably culture has been most fre¬ 
quently employed (e.g., Neuman 1984). The Plaquemine phenomenon may 
be conceived as a triangle with coastal Louisiana as its base and Greenville, 
Mississippi, at its apex (Neuman 1984:259). Dates for Plaquemine are usually 
given as a . d . 1200-1700 (Weinstein 19873:86).

Finally, the term Mississippian derives from the pioneering work of W. H. 
Holmes, who employed it to describe the shell-tempered ceramics often found 
with burials in the Central Mississippi Valley (Holmes 1903). Thus, from its 
inception, the term was linked to shell tempering as a technique of ceramic 
manufacture. This term, like the others discussed, came to be used for the 
“entire cultural complex which usually accompanies this characteristic pot¬ 
tery” (Ford and Willey 1941:348). It, too, is variously called a culture (Neuman 
1984), a period (Weinstein and Kelley 1992:37), and even a stage (Miller et al. 
2000:47). The term has been so variously and confusingly used, in fact, that 
Brain, for this reason, refused to employ it in the title of a paper on the subject 
(Brain 1978:331). The Mississippian cultural complex is associated with the 
great mound site of Cahokia in East St. Louis, beginning about a.d. 800 
(Neuman 1984:272). According to Neuman (1984:273), these influences radi¬ 
ated outward to other regional centers as far afield as the Aztlan site in Wis¬ 
consin, the Etowah site in Georgia, and the Moundville site in west-central 
Alabama. In addition to the presence of shell-tempered pottery, fully devel¬ 
oped Mississippian culture is defined by a reliance on agriculture; the presence 
of extensive mound sites, sometimes consisting of 20 or more mounds; and a 
ceremonial complex variously referred to as the Death Cult, the Southern 
Cult, the Buzzard Cult, and the Eagle Warrior Complex (Neuman 1984:272- 
278). Many centers of Mississippian culture, such as Cahokia and Mound¬ 
ville, seem to have declined in the fourteenth century into more dispersed and 
less centralized communities (Brown 2003:224, citing Wesson 1998:119—120; 
Young and Fowler 2000:311). So pervasive was the influence of the Mississip¬ 
pian culture concept that this term was also assigned to a period that began 
around a.d. 800 in the middle Mississippi Valley and reached the lower valley 
by about a.d. 1200 (Weinstein and Kelley 1992:31; Young and Fowler 2000). 
The Moundville influence stretched to the inhabitants of the Gulf coast, so 
that by a.d. 1200 we find elements of Mississippian culture at sites from 
Florida to Louisiana (Blitz and Mann 2000; Brown 2003). The earlier ten¬ 
dency to refer to Coles Creek as a period as well as a culture may be assigned 
to the literary styles of the various archaeologists who have written about the 
subject. The use of the term Mississippi for both culture and period, however, 
would appear to be a lot more self-conscious, in that there is an assumption 
that during the span a.d. 1200 to roughly a.d. 1700, Mississippian culture 
strongly influenced the other cultures of the Southeast. The nature of that 
influence is one of the preoccupations of specialists in the prehistory of the 
Southeast coast and one of the issues considered by this essay. On charts of 
culture chronology, the Coles Creek phenomenon is usually divided into a

Coles Creek proper, lasting from a.d. 700 to 1000, and a transitional Coles 
Creek, lasting from a.d. 1000 to 1200 (Weinstein i987a:86). What I ask here 
is what, precisely, did Coles Creek transition into? 

The two possibilities usually cited are the Plaquemine and the Mississip- 
pian cultures. Here there is a divergence of opinion. For Phillips (1970), 
Plaquemine was a development from the preceding Coles Creek culture, but 
over time interaction between Plaquemine and the external Mississippi in¬ 
fluence produced changes in the former, so that as time passed there was con¬ 
siderable convergence between Plaquemine and Mississippian proper. Brain 
(1978), on the other hand, sees Coles Creek as the essential culture that, about 
a.d. 1200, under Mississippian influences, evolved into Plaquemine. As a re¬ 
sult of Brain’s influence, “phases . . . which were formerly considered Plaque¬ 
mine culture manifestations... are now placed late in the Coles Creek period 
and assigned to a transitional Coles Creek culture” (Weinstein and Kelley 
1992:38). 

This essay does not provide a definitive answer to the question posed 
above, but it does suggest the pitfalls of overreliance on techniques of pottery 
manufacture in assigning cultural categories. This problem was noted long 
ago by Phillips (1970:108, 152), who predicted that with the passage of time 
tempering would come to be de-emphasized as a primary typological crite¬ 
rion. 

The 2002 Lake Salvador Shoreline Protection Project 

The sites of 16SC4 (Bois Chactas) and 16SC14 (Tabatiere Perdu) are middens 
composed primarily of Rangia shells, though occasional freshwater and salt¬ 
water bivalves are also found in the deposits. Each site is situated on the natu¬ 
ral levee of a distributary that at one time emptied into Lake Salvador (Figure 
5.1). Each site has suffered major erosion from the transgression of the lake 
over time, as can be seen from dead oak trees as much as 30 m offshore. 

The larger site is 16SC4 (Bois Chactas), which is also the site farther to the 
east. It consists of a shell beach approximately 210 m long from east to west, 
with approximately 75 m separating the lake on the south from the marsh to 
the north. Though the name implies the existence at some past time of Choc¬ 
taw Indians at this location, no historical evidence of such an occupation 
could be found. The tribe most closely associated with this site and others in 
the area is the Washa. The site’s elevation is about 1 m above the lake surface 
in most places, but at its western extreme it rises to 2 m; it is said by locals 
that at one point this prominence was higher but that the lake has taken most 
of it.

NORTHWEST LAKE SALVADOR, ST. CHARLES PARISH

The second site, 16SC14 (Tabatiere Perdu), is located about 5 km northeast 
of the point at which Bayou des Allemands empties into Lake Salvador and 
is the westernmost of the three sites examined in the Lake Salvador Shoreline 
Protection Project. It is 1.75 m high at the point overlooking the lake, where 
there are two camp structures, but this elevation, which is part of a relict 
distributary ridge, slopes down sharply to the lake on the south. The main 
portion of the site, which is wedged between the marsh on the north and the 
lake on the south, consists of about 1 acre, but on the northwest a shell ridge 
some 1.5 m high extends for 200 m north into the marsh. This ridge is part of 
the natural levee that continues into the main part of the site. 

These sites are in an area rich in archaeological remains. Several dugout 
canoes have been taken from the lake near them, and, indeed, one such canoe 
sat for years behind a camp house on 16SC4 until the craft deteriorated. The 
famous Grand Temple site (16LF4), a shell mound 15.2 m high, for years stood 
at the mouth of Bayou des Allemands where the bayou meets the lake. Be¬ 
cause geomorphological reconstructions suggest that Bayou des Allemands 
did not begin to empty into Lake Salvador until a.d. 500, this impressive shell 
mound must have been no older than Baytown times. The mound was gradu¬ 
ally destroyed by the Jahnke dredging company of New Orleans, which sold 
the shell, and what was left was finished off by Hurricane Juan in 1985. Other 
shell middens are present up and down the lake and several significant archaeo- 
logically known sites are within approximately 20 km of the study area. These 
include Pump Canal, Bayou des Families, the Sims site, the Discovery site, 
and the Peyregne site. 

The two sites described above have also received some archaeological at¬ 
tention over the years. Mclntire visited and collected from both sites, as well 
as the Grand Temple, in the early 1950s. Neuman also went to the sites and 
made collections. Rebecca Saunders, while regional archaeologist for that area, 
visited the sites in the company of Forrest Traverica and also collected. Marco 
Giardino, now with NASA, and Michael Commardelle visited the sites at 
various times. Prior to 2001, however, the most intensive work at any of the 
sites was Traverica’s 1976-1977 excavations at 16SC14. Aided by a chapter of 
the Louisiana Archaeological Society and an Explorer Scout troop, Traverica 
excavated three test units and supervised an admirable analysis of the artifacts 
recovered. His collections and data are at the Louisiana State University Mu¬ 
seum of Natural Science, along with his analyses, though a complete draft of 
his report could not be located (Traverica 1977). This, then, was the situation 
in 2001, when I was employed by St. Charles Parish to conduct a survey in 
connection with a shoreline protection project (Shuman 2002). The survey led 



IOO 


MALCOLM K. SHUMAN 


to a second project in 2002, whereby test excavations were conducted at both 
sites (Shuman and Shuman 2003). The data presented herein derive from that 
project. 

A third site, 16SC8, was also tested during the project, but no data will be 
presented from 16SC8 because of the shallowness of the two test units and the 
extreme disturbance in portions of that site. It should be noted, however, that 
the 16SC8 data do not contradict the other data presented in this chapter. 

Phases of Coles Creek, Plaquemine, and Mississippian 

The contemporary archaeological view is that in the Barataria area of Louisi¬ 
ana, Coles Creek culture (a.d. 800-1000) led into a transitional Coles Creek 
phase (a.d. 1000-1200) that, in turn, split off into two successor phases. In 
the western part of the Coastal Zone, it developed into a distinct Plaquemine- 
type culture referred to as the Barataria phase, distinct from the “Classic” 
Plaquemine farther to the north. In the eastern part of this area, it evolved 
into a synthetic Mississippian culture, represented by the Bayou Petre phase 
(Miller et al. 2000:343; Phillips 1970; Weinstein 1987a). 

Miller et al. (2000:347) hare suggested dates for the Barataria phase as circa 
a.d. 1200-1450. They cite radiocarbon dates from 16JE218 that range from 
a.d. 1300 to 1450 and “limited radiocarbon dates” from other sites in the re¬ 
gion ranging from a.d. 1200 to 1500 (Miller et al. 2000:345). They define the 
phase through the presence of Plaquemine ceramics, though there is an al¬ 
most total absence of Plaquemine Brushed. On the other hand, Southern Cult 
motifs are present. The significant types they and others associate with the 
phase are Avoyelles Punctated, var. Dupree, L’Eau Noire Incised, vars. L’Eau 
Noire and Bayou Bourbe, Carter Engraved, Maddox Engraved, and Mazique 
Incised, var Manchac (Miller et al. 2000:344). Buras Incised and Coles Creek 
Incised, var Hardy are also apparently markers, though Miller and colleagues 
note that Holley and DeMarcay (1977) do not include them in their discus¬ 
sion of Plaquemine sites in the area. 

The Mississippian culture Bayou Petre phase, according to Kniffen (1936), 
contains a “high percentage of shell-tempered sherds” and is concentrated in 
northernmost St. Bernard Parish. Kniffen noted a similarity between Bayou 
Petre sites and sites in Mobile Bay on the Gulf coast to the east. Indeed, Blitz 
and Mann (2000:55) describe the use of shell tempering as being a Pinola 
phase (a.d. 1200-1350) innovation on the eastern Gulf coast and they relate 
this to Mississippian influence from the interior; it is clear, then, that there 
was considerable interaction among coastal peoples at this time (though, for 
a slightly different perspective, see Greenwell 1984:151). Until that time on the 



NORTHWEST LAKE SALVADOR, ST. CHARLES PARISH

eastern coast, “most of the grog-tempered pottery consists of late Coles Creek/ 
early Plaquemine series type-varieties” (Blitz and Mann 2000:55). 

The divider between the western zone, with its dominant Barataria phase, 
and the eastern zone, with its dominant Bayou Petre manifestation, has been 
identified as the Barataria Basin (Miller et al. 2000:346-348). In the eastern 
zone, the Barataria phase is succeeded by the Bayou Petre phase: “Both of 
these phases are associated with the local Plaquemine culture, but the later 
phase shows strong influence from the east” (Miller et al. 2000:348). In the 
western zone, the late Plaquemine successor to the Barataria phase is “prob¬ 
ably represented by the Delta Natchezan phase” (Miller et al. 2000:348). 

The demarcation between these two zones would pass very near the two 
sites considered herein. Thus, it should not be surprising that 16SC4 and 
16SC14, during the transitional Coles Creek phase, seem to show character¬ 
istics of both zones. What is more interesting is what appears to be the early, 
extensive use of shell tempering. All the Lake Salvador sites have higher fre¬ 
quencies of shell than Sims (16SC2) (Davis and Giardino 1980). Bayou des 
Families (16JE218) produced just three shell-tempered sherds, all evidently 
from the same vessel (Kidder 1995). At the Discovery site (16LF66), only one 
shell-tempered type, Pensacola Incised, is listed in the ceramic descriptions; 
the rest are grog tempered (Miller et al. 2000). Finally, the test units at the 
Pump Canal site (16SC27) yielded only three shell-tempered sherds out of a 
total of 3,359 (Giardino 1994). Winterville Incised, largely absent at the Sims, 
Pump Canal, Bayou des Families, and Discovery sites, is present at both Lake 
Salvador sites. Mound Place Incised is also present as well as a small but sig¬ 
nificant amount of Moundville Incised. Interestingly, the only sherd of Mad¬ 
dox Engraved found during the current project was shell tempered and so was 
one sherd of Addis, attesting to the inclination of the inhabitants of these sites 
to use shell as much as possible. 

Description of Excavations and Radiocarbon Dates 

16SC4 (Bois Chactas) 

Five i-by-i-m test units were excavated at 16SC4, the largest of the project 
sites. All units were as close as possible to the beach ridge (i.e., on the extreme 
south side of the site), approximately equidistant from one another. Of these 
units, four were productive and one showed disturbance from late historic 
activity. Test Unit No. 2 extended to a depth of 94 cm to the water table, at 
which point the cultural deposits had played out. The most complex of all the 
units excavated, this unit revealed an oval feature of burned shell at 20 cm 



102 


MALCOLM K. SHUMAN 


below datum (bd) that extended to a depth of 40 cm bd. Included in the 
feature were animal bones and sherds. Extending from this feature on its east 
side was a crumbly matrix of solidified shell and ash. At 50 cm the shell fill of 
the unit became dense, and at about 60 cm the shell became compacted. At 
about 80 cm was a sand lens 5 cm thick, sloping downward from east to west. 
Underlying this lens was a layer of loose Ratigia shell. 

The unit produced 66 prehistoric sherds. Prehistoric ceramics were concen¬ 
trated in the upper 50 cm of the unit. The single most frequent ceramic type 
found was Baytown Plain, var. Cataouatche, but there were also single exam¬ 
ples of Coles Creek Incised, var. Hardy and Mazique Incised, var. North. There 
was also a sizable collection of shell-tempered material, which consisted largely 
of plainware, which I have typed as Bell Plain, Mississippi Plain, and Pinola 
Plain, the latter being a term I use (with apologies to Blitz and Mann) for a 
coarse grog-tempered ware identical to Baytown Plain, var. Cataouatche, ex¬ 
cept that it also includes shell. Decorated shell-tempered ceramics from this 
unit include Cracker Road Incised, Mound Place Incised, var. unspecified, and 
Moundville Incised, var. Singing River. 

The faunal complement of the unit consisted primarily of fish bone (352 
g), with small amounts of mammal (15 g) and reptile (9 g). The most frequent 
mammal identifiable by species was the muskrat. 

This unit yielded three radiocarbon dates. A sample of charcoal from Fea¬ 
ture A, at the 20-30 cm level, produced 2-sigma date ranges of cal a.d. 1050- 
1095 and cal a.d. 1140-1300. A second date was obtained by accelerator mass 
spectrometry (AMS) from a fragment of charcoal associated with Feature B 
at a depth of 30-40 cm bd. The 2-sigma range for this date was a.d. 795-1000. 
A third date, from fill charcoal, came from 94 cm bd and produced a 2-sigma 
range of cal a.d. 885-1020. It must be mentioned that a small fragment of 
bottle glass was recovered at the 50-60 cm level. The consistency of the radio¬ 
carbon dates and the fact that this was the only historic artifact from below 
20 cm suggests that the glass fell from higher in the profile and was inadver¬ 
tently incorporated into the fill when the fill was water screened. 

The second test unit that was radiocarbon dated was Unit 5, which ex¬ 
tended to a depth of 60 cm bd, at which point the water table was encoun¬ 
tered. Prehistoric cultural materials did, however, continue below this point. 

The stratigraphy of this unit consisted of four layers of shell of varying 
density, with considerably more soil content than in other test units. The 10- 
20 cm level was notable for producing oyster shells along with the Rangia 
shells and small quantities of historic and prehistoric artifacts. At 30 cm bd a 
stratum consisting of Rangia shell, quantities of animal bone, and prehistoric 



NORTHWEST LAKE SALVADOR, ST. CHARLES PARISH 


103 


ceramics was encountered. The percentage of animal bones and ceramics in¬ 
creased at the 40-50 and 50-60 cm bd levels, and the Rangia shells became 
mixed with the shells of a freshwater clam, Quadrula sp. In all, the lower 20 
cm of the unit produced 93.5 percent of the unit’s aboriginal ceramic content 
and 91 percent of the unit’s faunal complement. 

Two-thirds of the ceramics from this unit were grog tempered. This is the 
result of the presence of large quantities of Baytown Plain, var. Cataouatche, 
which made up 58.1 percent of the ceramics from the unit. Decorated grog- 
tempered types included Coles Creek Incised, var. Hardy and Evansville Punc¬ 
tated, var. Braxton. Of the shell-tempered wares, the most frequent types were 
Bell Plain, Mound Place Incised, var. Waltons Camp, and Pinola Plain, in that 
order. There were also two sherds of Moundville Incised, var. Snow’s Bend. In 
the Waltons Camp category were four sherds, apparently from the same vessel, 
with a single external, parallel-incised line and a bright red interior slip. The 
red slip is not characteristic of var. Waltons Camp and it would probably be 
equally justified to place these sherds in the var. unspecified category. 

The faunal array of this unit was composed predominantly of fish, fol¬ 
lowed closely by mammals. Fully 83 percent of the mammals by weight were 
from one taxon, muskrat. A sample of muskrat bones from the 50—60 cm level 
produced an AMS 2-sigma range of a.d. 1040-1260. 

The other two productive test units yielded similar results, though no 
radiocarbon dates were obtained from them. 

In all, 68.8 percent of the ceramics from 16SC4 were grog tempered and 
31.2 percent were shell tempered. The calibrated radiocarbon dates span the 
years from a.d. 795 to 1260. 

16SC14 (Tabatiere Perdu) 

Three test units were excavated at this site. Two, near the beach ridge, were 
badly contaminated by recent materials, while the third, which extended to a 
depth of 90 cm bd, produced a large quantity of prehistoric ceramics and 
animal bones, as well as a radiocarbon date. 

Three-quarters (75.6 percent) of the aboriginal ceramics from this site were 
grog, grit, and sand tempered, while only a quarter (24.4 percent) were shell 
tempered. Again, the largest single variety was the grog-tempered Baytown 
Plain, var. Cataouatche, followed by the shell-tempered types, Mississippi 
Plain, Bell Plain, and Pinola Plain, in that order. Also represented were small 
amounts of Barton Incised, Moundville Incised, var. Snow’s Bend, and Win- 
terville Incised, vars. Winterville and unspecified. 

The faunal remains consisted of almost equal amounts of fish and mam- 



104 


MALCOLM K. SHUMAN 


mal, plus a smaller amount of reptile. Of those mammalian remains that 
could be speciated, there was only one taxon, Odocoielus virginianus (white¬ 
tailed deer). A radiocarbon date from a deer femur taken from the north wall 
at 58 cm bd produced a 2-sigma range of cal a.d. 1290-1420. 

The ceramics and radiocarbon date from this unit strongly suggest a Plaque- 
mine occupation. This is bolstered by Traverica’s excavations in 1976-1977. 
His test units, located atop the distributary ridge, were deeper than the 2002 
units because they were located farther from the beach ridge. A tabulation of 
decorated types indicates that Traverica’s assemblage spans the Coles Creek 
and Mississippi periods, although nearly two-thirds are Mississippian in age, 
and almost all the Mississippi period sherds are grog-tempered types. 

Summary of 16SC4 and 16SC14 

To summarize, the ceramics from 16SC4 were concentrated in layers contain¬ 
ing heavy accumulations of muskrat bones, this animal being particularly 
prevalent in Coles Creek sites in this area (Davis 1984; Misner and Reitz 1994). 
Four radiocarbon dates span the Coles Creek and transitional Coles Creek 
periods. On the other hand, 16SC4 produced a higher proportion of shell- 
tempered, Mississippian ceramics than any other site in the immediate area, 
including Sims, Bayou des Families, Pump Canal, and Discovery. Judging 
from the foregoing, the site seems poised to develop into a Bayou Petre phase 
Mississippian site. 

At nearby 16SC14 the ceramic assemblage is primarily Plaquemine with 
some Coles Creek sherds. The predominant mammal is deer, and the single 
radiocarbon date is Barataria phase Plaquemine. The differences in excavated 
assemblages, both my own and Traverica’s, might be explained by the greater 
protection of 16SC14 from storm surges as a result of higher elevation. 

If 16SC14 is what 16SC4 would have become (and may, in fact, have once 
been, if we assume that storm surges obliterated the upper strata of 16SC4), 
then we have a situation in which Coles Creek, heavily influenced by Gulf 
Coast Mississippian, evolves not into Mississippian but into Barataria phase 
Plaquemine. For if the Barataria phase is defined by the presence of Anna 
Incised, Avoyelles Punctated, Carter Engraved, Coles Creek Incised, var 
Hardy, Harrison Bayou Incised, Southern Cult motifs, and the near absence 
of Plaquemine Brushed, 16SC14 meets six of the seven criteria. 

Questions 

One of the most intriguing questions raised by this project is the relationship 
between what I have called Pinola Plain and Kidder’s Baytown Plain, var. 



NORTHWEST LAKE SALVADOR, ST. CHARLES PARISH 


105 


Cataouatche. The former refers to the grog-and-shell-tempered wares that 
Blitz and Mann (2000) describe for the Pinola phase (a.d. 1200-1350) of the 
eastern Gulf coast. The latter indicates the grog-tempered ware that Kidder 
(1995) found at the Mississippi period Bayou des Families (16JE218) site. The 
only difference between these two classes from the Lake Salvador sites is the 
presence/absence of shell in the paste. 

If we accept the dating suggested by Blitz, Mann, and Kidder for these two 
classes of wares, we are faced with the situation of having a shell-tempered 
ware evolve into a grog-tempered one. Such a view, while not irrational, as¬ 
cribes what I consider rather too much importance to paste characteristics. It 
is far more reasonable to view these as one single, contemporaneous group of 
wares, some of which had shell added (either by accident or design) and some 
of which did not. 

If the latter explanation is correct, then the question resolves into the issue 
of whether Pinola wares occur in the Lake Salvador area later than they do on 
the eastern Gulf coast or whether it is a matter of the var. Cataouatche wares 
occurring earlier on Lake Salvador (i.e., beginning in transitional Coles Creek 
times and lasting until Mississippi times). 

The available evidence suggests the latter is the case. The radiocarbon dates 
and faunal evidence for 16SC4 indicate a transitional Coles Creek occupation. 
If var. Cataouatche is late Mississippian, then we have a case in which the 
radiocarbon dates and faunal array indicate transitional Coles Creek even 
though few Coles Creek ceramics occur to support this assignment and in 
which Pinola phase shell-tempered ceramics are followed chronologically by 
an identical ceramic sans shell. If, on the other hand, var. Cataouatche is tran¬ 
sitional Coles Creek and early Mississippian (a situation that does not exclude 
its also extending into late Mississippian times), then Pinola Plain is seen as 
contemporary with var. Cataouatche (i.e., the same ware with shell). This is 
especially likely if we adopt Davis’s (1981:68) view of some Mississippian de¬ 
signs (e.g., Mound Place Incised) as being simply Coles Creek ceramics with 
shell added. This view is bolstered by the statistical analysis of plainware ver¬ 
sus decorated ware sorting at 16SC4, which suggested that plainwares tended 
to be sorted as being somewhat later than decorated ones. It is also supported 
by the dearth of decorated Coles Creek ceramics in the archaeological depos¬ 
its: if var. Cataouatche is an all-purpose variety with a long lifespan, its high 
percentage in the ceramic inventory may indicate that it represents both plain- 
ware of the transitional Coles Creek and Mississippi periods and also the in¬ 
cised (and thus diagnostic) vessels of the same periods, which tended to have 
decorations only below the rims.

MALCOLM K. SHUMAN 


In short, then, it seems probable that grog-tempered Baytown Plain, var. 
Cataouatche and grog-and-shell-tempered Pinola Plain are virtually the same 
ware and that the manufacture of this ware began no later than transitional 
Coles Creek times. Furthermore, it seems that this ware was used in transi¬ 
tional Coles Creek times as the vehicle for incised pottery as well as plainware. 
In the northwest Lake Salvador area, certain shell-tempered Mississippian 
wares based on Coles Creek designs also appear to occur with some frequency 
in the transitional Coles Creek period. This situation could provide partial 
validation for Brains (1978) suggestion that the Mississippian influence began 
in late Coles Creek times. If so, however, it would appear that this influence, 
at least on the ceramics, withered with time. 

Returning to Phillips, we must now ask whether, in applying the conven¬ 
tional terminology (transitional Coles Creek, Plaquemine, and Mississippian) 
we have, in the case of these sites, even a “locally intelligible” situation. If we 
analyze the data in terms of the conventional taxonomy, the following possi¬ 
bilities are evident: the use at these sites of shell tempering during Transitional 
Coles Creek and the withering of this use in the succeeding Plaquemine pe¬ 
riod represents an influx of Mississippian ideas/peoples during the former and 
their supercession by Plaquemine ideas/peoples during the latter. While these 
possibilities cannot be excluded, they tend to simplify what was in all prob¬ 
ability a complex situation. The sites in question are situated at a crossroads 
of historic commerce (Shuman and Shuman 2003). The Barataria-Lake Sal¬ 
vador corridor was a gateway from the Gulf to the interior in historic times, 
perhaps most famously used by the pirate Jean Lafitte. In the nineteenth cen¬ 
tury groups from New Orleans held Sunday outings on 16SC4. It is clear that 
the same situation pertained prehistorically. Transport would have been from 
the Gulf to Barataria Bay to Lake Salvador and into Lake Cataouatche, or 
from Lake Salvador up Bayou des Allemands. In short, the sites described 
herein were at the nexus of an interaction sphere that linked groups along the 
east and west Gulf coast with the interior. 

While there may have been some migration of individuals from one area 
to another, it makes more sense to me to suggest that the major movement of 
individuals through this area was for the purpose of commerce and that the 
practice of shell tempering resulted from a combination of borrowing the con¬ 
cept from the eastern Gulf coast and the ready abundance of shell. The ces¬ 
sation of the use of shell may, indeed, be the result of a stronger influence 
(Plaquemine) from the interior and the west in the post-A.D. 1200 period, as 
the Mississippian interaction sphere shrank and the tribes as we know them 
today formed from the disintegration of Moundville (see Galloway 1995). 



NORTHWEST LAKE SALVADOR, ST. CHARLES PARISH 


107 


These are, however, speculations, and in the end we must return to Phillips’s 
caution about not attributing too much significance to paste characteristics. 
These sites are located in an area of unusually high demographic activity, with 
frequent comings and goings, as others have long noted (i.e., Brown 1984:122). 
Sampling error is thus not out of the question. So, there are several possible 
explanations for the phenomena noted herein and it remains for future inves¬ 
tigators to determine which explanation is most viable.

Plaquemine Recipes 

Using Computer-Assisted Petrographic Analysis to 
Investigate Plaquemine Ceramic Recipes 

Patrick C. Livingood 


Archaeologists working in the Lower Mississippi Valley (LMV) have fo¬ 
cused a great deal of energy on identifying, classifying, and explaining the 
Plaquemine-Mississippian dichotomy (Phillips 1970; Phillips et al. 1951; Wil¬ 
liams and Brain 1983). The primary tool in this investigation has been ceram¬ 
ics, and the principal attribute is the presence or absence of shell tempering 
(see Rees and Livingood, this volume). Despite the axiomatic role that shell 
tempering plays in identifying the Plaquemine-Mississippian divide, there are 
many places and times in the Plaquemine world in which a significant per¬ 
centage of the ceramic assemblage contains provocative mixtures of shell and 
grog tempering and in which decorative motifs span temper types. This has 
led some archaeologists (Hally 1972; Kidder 1998b) to question whether too 
much interpretive weight has been given to the presence and absence of shell 
tempering. 

One of the challenges faced by archaeologists attempting to study the 
Plaquemine phases in which shell and grog are both used as tempering agents 
is that it is not clear that the varieties specified for distinguishing ceramic 
fabric correspond well to real cultural and technological distinctions made by 
the potters. Part of the problem is that the type-variety system developed by 
Ford, Phillips, Williams, and Brain for the LMV is based on macroscopically 
observed criteria, whereas potters often ground the tempering agents into 
very small sizes and sometimes mixed tempering agents together in ways that 
make macroscopic classification challenging and subjective. A cursory glance 
at the intellectual history of the sorting criteria for plainwares in the Lower 
Yazoo and Natchez regions reveals how murky these classifications can be. 

Addis Plain was originally documented by Quimby (1942:265-266, 1951: 
107-109) as a “clay-tempered type” and a major diagnostic of Plaquemine 
culture. Phillips (1970:48-49) designated Addis as a variety of the type Bay- 



PLAQUEMINE CERAMIC RECIPES 


109 


town Plain and defined it as the “clay-tempered plainware of the Mississippi 
period from the Medora and Plaquemine phases in the Delta and Lower Red 
River regions to the Mayersville phase in [the Lower Yazoo].” Interestingly, 
Phillips (1970:60-61) also acknowledged the similarity between his Baytown 
Plain, var. Addis and his Bell Plain, vars. Holly Bluff and St. Catherine, which 
contain finely pulverized shell sometimes in quantities so small that their in¬ 
clusion seems to be “accidental.” Williams and Brain (1983:92) retained Addis 
as a variety of Baytown Plain but used Bell Plain, var Greenville to describe 
Addis with the addition of shell temper to the paste. They also retained Bell 
Plain, var Holly Bluff to describe heterogeneous Addis-like sherds in which 
shell tempering is slightly more prevalent than in Bell Plain, var. Greenville. 
Steponaitis (1974:116) proposed elevating Addis to the level of type and de¬ 
fined it as having a heterogeneous organic grog-tempered paste but allowed 
for the presence of shell in some types. Steponaitis then relocated the Green¬ 
ville and St. Catherine varieties from their position under Bell Plain to be va¬ 
rieties under Addis Plain. The elevation of Addis to the level of type has been 
made by some archaeologists, particularly those who have worked in the 
Natchez Bluffs (e.g., Brain 1989; Brain et al. 1994; Brown 1985a) but has not 
been embraced by others (e.g., Kidder 1993a; Ryan 2004). More recently, 
Ryan (2004:94) proposes keeping Addis as a variety of Baytown Plain for 
the analysis of Hedgeland ceramics because of the close relationship between 
Addis and Baytown Plain, var. Little Tiger. Little Tiger is proposed as a tran¬ 
sitional ware between earlier Baytown pastes and Addis and is differentiated 
from Addis because it has less temper. 

There are two fundamental explanations for the tortured history of these 
types. First, Phillips (1970) and later Williams and Brain (1983) fundamentally 
viewed the Plaquemine-Mississippian phenomenon as a cultural divide and it 
was necessary to define phases as either belonging to Mississippian or Plaque¬ 
mine (Jeter and Williams 1989:212; Rees and Livingood, this volume). The 
primary tool in this enterprise was ceramic typology and in the hierarchical 
system of type-variety classification the presence or absence of shell was a 
first-order attribute. This is entirely understandable from a macroregional per¬ 
spective, and it explains why Phillips would place the Addis variety under 
Baytown Plain and the closely related Holly Bluff and St. Catherine varieties 
under Bell Plain. However, for archaeologists working in phases in which 
these closely related types are common, this system of nomenclature can be 
unwieldy. Another explanation for the difficulties archaeologists have had in 
defining and arranging these taxa is that in the phases in which potters were 
freely choosing between shell and grog temper, a larger number of permuta¬ 
tions is possible; designing a system to accurately describe these permutations

is problematic. Support for this argument can be found from merely counting 
the number of plainware varieties in use in the LMV. Despite large quantities 
of coarse shell-tempered ceramics, only three varieties of Mississippi Plain are 
in common use in the Plaquemine world: Coker, Mainfort, and Yazoo. How¬ 
ever, there are eight varieties commonly used to categorize fine-sized-grog- 
tempered and grog- and shell-tempered fabrics in the Plaquemine period: 
Addis Plain, vars. Addis, Greenville, Junkin, Ratcliffe, and St. Catherine, and 
Bell Plain, vars. Bell, Holly Bluff, and New Madrid. 

Michael Galaty (2006) has used a ceramic ecology approach to argue that 
on a regional scale differences in tempering choices in Mississippi might be 
related to differences in the types of clays and tempering agents available to 
potters. For example, he argues persuasively that pre-Mississippian period 
potters in west Mississippi may have lacked access to sand suitable for tem¬ 
pering and relied instead on grog, whereas potters in east Mississippi may 
have preferred the easily available sand. Although he does not specifically ad¬ 
dress the regional differences in the use of grog and shell, his work raises the 
possibility that macroregional differences in temper might be related to ecology, 
not culture. 

However, within a site the variation being reflected in the varieties of Addis 
Plain and other closely related types originates from the choices made by pot¬ 
ters during clay preparation. It is possible that the potters could have been 
haphazardly adding grog and shell to certain vessels, which would lead to a 
random-looking distribution of temper frequency. However, it is much more 
likely that the Plaquemine potters were in fact very careful about clay prepa¬ 
ration and the addition of tempering agents, like most ethnographically stud¬ 
ied potters (Arnold 1985; Krause 1985). Potters often clean their clays to re¬ 
move extraneous particles and then add carefully prepared tempering agents. 
Some potters mix temper with the prepared clays until the paste reaches a 
desired texture. For example, the Ibibio of Nigeria add grog or sand to the 
clay until it reaches the correct consistency called aduang nbibiot (Nicklin 
1981:173; Rice 1987:121). Other potters follow a specific recipe that designates 
the ratio of clay and temper (Rice 1987:121). For example, some Kavango pot¬ 
ters in southern Africa mix two parts grog to three parts clay (Blandino 
1997:26), whereas the Shipibo-Conibo of eastern Peru have a ratio of clay to 
temper of two to three (DeBoer and Lathrap 1979). 

The goal of this study is to test a small assemblage of Plaquemine ceramics 
to see whether it is possible to detect modes in the distribution of temper size 
and abundance. If there are modes, then these can be used to reconstruct the 
paste recipes used by the potters. Armed with knowledge of the paste recipes, 
we can evaluate the utility of the commonly used plainware varieties for class-

ifying the ceramic assemblage. Furthermore, it seems likely that of all of the 
decisions a potter makes, that of temper is probably one of the most resistant 
to change over time. Vessel form and decoration can change over decades in 
pre-state societies, but temper choices typically persist for centuries. In most 
pre-state societies, pottery production is a household activity (Arnold 1985:100- 
101; Sinopoli 1991:98-102; van der Leeuw 1977), and it is presumed that 
knowledge about pottery production is handed down through generations 
within the household. Whereas more visible aspects of pottery production 
such as vessel form and decoration might be subject to changing personal or 
group concepts of pottery construction, less visible and more technological 
decisions about temper are likely to be more resistant to change. Because of 
this, with sufficient information about paste recipes it might be possible to 
tease apart different communities of production, especially when multiple 
tempering agents encode greater information. 

Since the terms used in ceramic studies such as paste and temper are often 
defined differently by different authors, it is important to be clear how they 
are used in this chapter. Following the connotations common to the discussion 
of LMV ceramics (which differ somewhat from the definitions common to 
petrographic literature [e.g., Stoltman 1991:109-110]), temper refers exclusively 
to material intentionally added to a clay to improve its physical properties. 
Inclusion refers to all aplastics in a clay, whether they were added deliberately 
or were naturally occurring. Paste is defined as the clay plus all inclusions. 
Therefore, a paste recipe refers to all of the rules a potter follows to create the 
paste used to form a vessel, including where the clay should be gathered, how 
it should be processed, what temper should be added and in what quantities, 
and how the clay should be handled and treated before and during vessel 
creation. 

The Sample 

The sample under study comprises 29 sherds from the Pevey (22LW510) and 
Lowe-Steen (22LW511) sites located on the central Pearl River in Lawrence 
County, Mississippi. The Pevey site is a large mound site, with nine extant 
flat-top mounds, located approximately 18 km south of the two-mound Lowe- 
Steen site. Both sites date primarily to the Winstead phase (Livingood 1999), 
which is temporally equivalent to the Anna or Winterville phases, and the 
Pevey site also has a small Pevey phase occupation, which is temporally 
equivalent to the early Foster or Lake George phases. 

The Pevey site was first investigated by Baxter Mann and John Blitz be¬ 
tween 1982 and 1984 (Mann 1988). More extensive excavations were carried 
out at both sites by the University of North Carolina Field Schools in 1993

and 1994 (Livingood 1999), including test units in every mound. In 2000, I 
returned with volunteers primarily from the University of Michigan to test 
the plaza area to the west and north of the Pevey site. 

The two most common decorated varieties found at the Pevey and Lowe- 
Steen sites are Anna Incised, var. Anna and Plaquemine Brushed, var. Plaque- 
mine. Other common decorated types include Carter Engraved, var. Carter, 
Grace Brushed, var. Grace, D’Olive Incised, var. D’Olive, L’Eau Noire Incised, 
var. L’Eau Noire, Leland Incised, Mound Place Incised, and Parkin Punctated. 
Most of these types are most commonly found at sites to the west of the Pearl 
River along the Mississippi River, while other types, such as Mound Place 
Incised and D’Olive Incised, are more commonly associated with sites to the 
east such as Bottle Creek or Moundville. Several of the most abundant types 
represent decorative traditions that span multiple tempers. For example, Anna 
Incised, var. Anna is the type assigned to sherds from shallow bowls or plates 
with interior decoration if the temper is categorized as being Addis Plain, var. 
Addis or Addis Plain, var. Greenville. But if the exact same vessel were tem¬ 
pered more heavily with shell, it would be classified as D’Olive Incised, var. 
D’Olive. Likewise, jars with exterior brushing on Addis or Greenville pastes 
are called Plaquemine Brushed, var. Plaquemine, while jars with shell temper¬ 
ing are called Grace Brushed, var. Grace. 

The initial analysis and classification of ceramics indicates that middle 
Pearl potters were making interesting and complex choices with regard to 
temper. The most common fabric used at the Pevey and Lowe-Steen sites is 
coarse shell tempering (72 percent of all sherds). However, Pearl River potters 
assigned special importance to Addis paste sherds because they executed most 
of their decorative motifs on these wares. Fifty-two percent of all decorated 
sherds have Addis Plain, var. Addis paste, 17 percent of decorated sherds have 
a Greenville paste, and only 27 percent have a Mississippi Plain paste. Despite 
the preference for Addis pastes, several decorative techniques crosscut temper 
types. If we consider all of the interior decorated plates and bowls (Anna 
Incised and D’Olive Incised) together, 60 percent are executed on Addis 
paste, 25 percent on Greenville paste, and 14 percent on Mississippi Plain 
paste. On the basis of these initial observations, it is clear that middle Pearl 
potters were comfortable using a wide variety of temper combinations. Addi¬ 
tionally, it is not obvious whether the plainware varieties developed primarily 
for the Lower Yazoo and Natchez regions are the most appropriate varieties to 
classify the ceramics from the middle Pearl River. 

All of the 29 sherds selected for this analysis are diagnostic of vessel shape, 
decoration, or both. The sherds were deliberately chosen to represent the dif- 



PLAQUEMINE CERAMIC RECIPES

ferent temper combinations under investigation and to be representative of 
different vessel forms and functions. Of the 29 sherds in this analysis, 24 were 
excavated from a single 2-X-2-m unit at the Pevey site designated Unit M. 
This unit is located approximately 25 m northwest from the base of the site’s 
large mound, Mound E, in a small rise on the edge of the natural terrace. 
Only four of the sherds from Unit M come from the upper level, which prob¬ 
ably has an early Pevey phase assignment while the remaining 20 sherds have 
a Winstead phase date. Of the sherds not from Unit M, two come from the 
Mound H excavation and one from the Mound I excavation at the Pevey site, 
while the final two come from the Feature 1 excavation at the Lowe-Steen site. 
All have a Winstead phase date. 

Methodology 

The only technique appropriate to gather data on temper abundance and size 
from this sample is ceramic petrography, which is the practice of examining 
ceramics microscopically to study the clay characteristics and inclusions. Hi- 
tech chemically based approaches such as x-ray diffraction or neutron activa¬ 
tion can provide only a partial picture since they are unable to chemically 
distinguish grog from the clay matrix. Ceramic petrography has been a part 
of American archaeology since the days of Anna Shepard (Shepard 1976), but 
most modern analysis owes much to Jim Stoltman, who systematized the use 
of point-counting techniques borrowed from geological petrography in order 
to bring a higher level of rigor and accuracy to the field (Stoltman 1989,1991, 
2000). Today, most ceramic petrographers use a point-counting technique to 
quantify inclusions, which involves overlaying the sample with a grid of 
points in order to obtain representative counts of constituent particles. This 
technique is excellent at measuring the abundance of constituent particles, 
and it remains the gold standard for measuring petrographic data (Cordell and 
Livingood 2004). 

For this study, I have employed computer-assisted petrographic analysis 
(CAPA) (Livingood 2002, 2004; Velde and Drue 1998). This procedure starts 
with a digital image of the thin section and uses digital image analysis soft¬ 
ware to help produce a map of the section identifying the constituent particles. 
For some particle types, the software can do most of the work. It can be 
scripted to automatically identify a class of particles with a high degree of 
accuracy and precision. In other cases, a human operator is required to map 
the particle types, but the software can help by producing false-color images 
that make identifying the particles much easier. 

CAPA has a few benefits over traditional microscope-based petrographic

analysis (Cordell and Livingood 2004). First, it is less expensive under some 
circumstances, since an inexpensive consumer-quality flatbed scanner has 
sufficient resolution to identify temper particles. Second, because a complete 
map of the thin section is produced, far more information is produced. Since 
every particle is individually identified and measured, every possible metric 
related to particle count, size, shape, orientation, and location can be gener¬ 
ated. Third, under some circumstances, this procedure can be faster than man¬ 
ual point-counting techniques. This is especially true if the samples are rela¬ 
tively homogenous and the features of interest are distinct. Fourth, the digital 
nature of the analysis makes it much easier to revise and correct analyses and 
to share results. 

For this study each thin section was scanned at 3,200 X 1,600 dpi using 
an Epson Perfection 1640 scanner with a transparency adapter and polariz¬ 
ing film. Two scans were produced from each thin section: the first scan was 
produced with plane-polarized light and the second with cross-polarized light 
(Figures 6.1-6.2). Next, the images were aligned as layers within Adobe Photo¬ 
shop. Software from Reindeer Graphics called Image Analysis Toolkit (Russ 
1999) was used to create derivative images from these two layers by manipu¬ 
lating the information in their color channels (Figure 6.3). If the image can 
be manipulated in such a way that the desired features are distinguished by 
color, intensity, or texture, it is possible to automate the process of identifying 
the pixels corresponding to the features. Under cross-polarized light certain 
crystals appear to have unusual or bright colors because they split the light 
into two rays with different refraction indices. This property is referred to as 
birefringence, and these particles are very easy to identify with the software. 
In general, the identification of birefringent particles and voids was almost 
entirely automated, the automatic identification of shell was fairly accurate 
but required some editing, and the identification of grog was primarily done 
by hand. The end result of each identification is a series of Boolean images for 
every type of feature of interest (Figure 6.4). Every pixel in a Boolean image 
is either black, indicating it is a part of the feature, or white, indicating it is 
not. A function in the Image Analysis Toolkit produces measurements of the 
features in the Boolean images for analysis in a spreadsheet or statistical analy¬ 
sis software package. 

At a scanning resolution of 1,600 dpi there are approximately 63 pixels per 
millimeter in the finished scan. Based on the Wentworth scale (Rice 1987:38), 
silt particles would appear to be 0.2 to 3.9 pixels wide, very fine sand would 
appear to be 3.9 to 7.9 pixels wide, fine sand 7.9 to 15.7 pixels wide, and 
medium sand 15.7 to 31.5 pixels wide. Obviously, larger particles are easier to 
identify and map precisely. However, there are no easy rules to determine the

minimum size that a feature must be scanned at in order to accurately distin¬ 
guish it. This size depends on the degree of visual contrast between the par¬ 
ticle and the surrounding matrix. However, tests definitively proved that 3,200 
X 1,600 dpi is not sufficient to accurately identify particles the size of very fine 
and fine sand (Cordell and Livingood 2004). Since measuring particles of this 
size is not crucial to the research goals of this project, all measurements of 
birefringent particles with an area less than 0.2 mm 2 were discarded from 
consideration in this study. Therefore, all measurements of birefringent parti¬ 
cles in this report pertain only to larger particles. 

The majority of birefringent particles in these samples are sand, which ap¬ 
pears to be a natural inclusion. However, traditional petrographic analysis by 
Ann Cordell (2004) also found in some of the samples a small number of 
naturally occurring constituents such as muscovite mica that also have high 
birefringent values. Regardless, because they are rare and because they made 
little difference to the study goals, no effort was made to differentiate different 
particles with high birefringent values. Furthermore, in order to accurately 
measure all of the birefringent particles in the sample, it is typically necessary 
to take two cross-polarized scans, with the sample rotated 90 degrees between 
scans, and together these will identify all of the birefringent particles. How¬ 
ever, since the orientation of birefringent particles is assumed to be random, 
it is possible to estimate their total abundance by doubling the area measured 
from a single cross-polarized scan. This produces a reasonably accurate esti¬ 
mate, which is fine for the research goals of this study. Therefore, the values 
reported in Table 6.1 to measure the abundance of birefringent particles in the 
sample are most accurately called an estimate of large birefringent particle 
abundance (ELBPA) and have been calculated by doubling the sum of the 
area of all birefringent particles at least 0.2 mm 2 in area identified in the 
analysis of a single cross-polarized image. This estimate avoids making any 
claims about the abundance of birefringent particles of a smaller size. It can 
be effectively interpreted as a proxy for the abundance of medium to large 
sand particles or, more precisely, an estimate of the sum of the surface area of 
all sand with particle size greater than 0.2 mm 2 . 

In an earlier study, four samples were measured using CAPA and using 
traditional microscope-based petrographic point-counting (Cordell and Liv¬ 
ingood 2004). Once the problems of identifying smaller birefringent particles 
using the scanning resolution of 3,200 X 1,600 dpi were controlled for, CAPA 
was deemed sufficiently accurate to proceed with additional petrographic 
analyses. In the test, there was one sample for which the grog measurements 
were significantly different. The problem was that I inaccurately identified

some hematitic, ferric concretions, lumps, or stains as grog. Although I was 
able to fix the problem, it underscored the difficulty of distinguishing grog 
from other natural stains even when using traditional microscope-based analysis 
(Di Caprio and Vaughn 1993). Great care has been taken in this analysis to 
try to ensure that the category of grog measured in Table 6.1 only includes 
recycled pieces of pottery that were intentionally added as temper. However, 
these classifications can sometimes be difficult and I expect the range of error 
to be greater for this temper identification than for shell, voids, or ELBPA. 

Following the standards of petrographic point counting (Stoltman 1989, 
1991), Table 6.1 reports the size of each thin section and the percentage of 
nontemper voids inside each sample. The percent abundance of each temper 
type is the ratio of temper area to matrix area, not including voids. Voids in 
the sample from leached shell are counted as shell temper. 

Analysis 

Before presenting any results, it is important to mention a few caveats. First, 
there is the standard warning that this is a small sample size and any patterns 
that are discovered must be considered merely suggestive. Second, there is no 
expectation that any conclusions drawn from these Pearl River ceramics will 
generalize to the rest of the Plaquemine area or anywhere else. In fact, there 
are strong reasons to suspect that the Pearl River assemblage might be a 
unique reflection of the social, historical, and ecological needs of the middle 
Pearl community. 

Figure 6 .5 shows the biplot of the percentage of shell and grog with each 
sample coded by the original plainware variety classification. At first glance, 
a few important observations can be made. First, there is a single outlier that 
is a heavily shell-tempered sherd. Second, the graph has a general L shape. 
Eight of the samples have a relatively high abundance of shell (>10 percent) 
and low abundance of grog (<6 percent). Another eight of the samples have 
a relatively high abundance of grog (>8 percent) and a low abundance of shell 
(<1.2 percent). The remaining 13 samples have relatively small amounts of 
both grog (<8 percent) and shell (<10 percent). Another observation is that 
there is limited fit between the macroscopically observed temper and the 
microscopically measured categories. While the most heavily shell-tempered 
sherds were all correctly identified as Mississippi Plain and the most heavily 
grog-tempered sherds were classified as Addis Plain, var Addis, there is a level 
of murkiness in the middle. Some sherds classified as Mississippi Plain appear 
to be nearly indistinguishable using abundance measurements from some Bell 
Plain and Addis, var. Greenville sherds. Also, some sherds classified as Addis

so close. This is not an unexpected finding. In a summary of petrographic

and ceramic types that were designed to describe macroscopic attributes such 
as decoration and form. 

Other than the abundantly grog-tempered and abundantly shell-tempered 
samples, it is not immediately clear whether there are any modes present in 
the data. It is entirely possible that if we increased the sample size we would 
see a continuous distribution of values and that the reason there are problems

in applying the type-variety system to classifying fabric is that we are trying 
to apply discrete categories to a continuum. It is also possible that an increase 
in sample size would help to bring into focus the modes present in the data. 
Since the middle Pearl River potters took so much care with so many observ¬ 
able aspects of pottery manufacture such as finely grinding temper particles, 
generally practicing careful incising and engraving techniques, and frequently 
polishing the finished vessels, it is probably safe to assume that they were care-

ful in their clay preparation and followed some form of paste recipe. If this is 
the case, here are the modes suggested by the data (Figure 6.6). 

The cluster boundaries described below were constructed by considering 
the results of various cluster analyses, visual inspection of the graphs, a con¬ 
sideration of homogeneity of vessel form and type within clusters, and the 
analytical utility of proposed cluster definitions. Temper size was also used to 
construct these clusters, but abundance was found to be a much more useful 
metric. Generally, sherds with smaller temper sizes also had smaller abun¬ 
dances, while sherds with larger temper particles had higher abundances. 
Temper size was not as useful as a distinguishing variable for this sample, 
likely because the sherds were largely constructed during a relatively short 
period of time. In contrast, Ryan’s ( 2004 : 93 ) microscopic analysis of sherds 
from the Hedgeland site found that grog size was crucially important for dif¬ 
ferentiating between Percy Creek, Little Tiger, and Addis varieties. Finally, bire- 
fringent particles, which mostly represent quartz sand, are absent from the 
cluster descriptions because there is little correlation between ELBPA and any 
of the other major variables and all of the observed birefringent particles 
seemed to be rounded grains (Rice 1987 : 410 ), which suggests that the sand is 
a naturally occurring aplastic inclusion. 

Cluster 1 

If we exclude sample 23 , which is a clear outlier, the first set of clusters con¬ 
tains sherds with a large quantity of shell and little or no grog. All of the 
sherds in Clusters iA, iB, and iC have ratios of shell to grog between 5 to 1 
and 10 to 1 and could be combined on this basis alone. However, since they 
also have significantly different amounts of shell and grog and tend to cluster 
according to vessel type, they are being subdivided as indicated. 

Cluster iA. The sherds in this cluster have shell abundance between 10 per¬ 
cent and 18 percent and grog abundance less than 2 percent. This cluster con¬ 
tains four sherds of Mississippi Plain. 

Cluster iB. This cluster is defined as having a high abundance of shell (15 
percent to 22 percent) and moderate amounts of grog (3 percent to 6 percent). 
The sherds in this sample include one piece of Mississippi Plain, a Grace 
Brushed, var. Grace sherd, and a D’Olive Incised, var. D’Olive vessel. When 
considering the total amount of temper added to the vessel (grog plus shell), 
this cluster contains the greatest amount of total temper of any of the clusters. 

Cluster iC. The two sherds in this sample are both Grace Brushed, var. 
Grace sherds and have between 3 percent and 7 percent shell and almost 
no grog.

Cluster 2 

This cluster is defined as having a shell-to-grog ratio between 1 or 2 to 1 . This 
cluster has abundances of grog between 3 percent and 5 percent and of shell 
between 5 percent and 8 percent. All of the sherds in this sample are highly 
decorated serving vessels, including one sherd of Anna Incised, var. Anna, two 
sherds of D’Olive Incised, var. D’Olive, and one sherd of Carter Engraved, 
var. Carter. 


Cluster 3 

This cluster contains three sherds that might have been called “untempered” 
in the nomenclature of Ford or Quimby. All three sherds in this cluster con¬ 
tain less than 2 percent shell and grog and all three sherds come from Anna 
Incised, var. Anna vessels. 

Cluster 4 

This cluster contains four sherds with moderate amounts of grog tempering 
(3 percent to 6 percent) and little shell tempering (<2 percent). The vessels in 
this cluster include examples of Bell Plain, Mound Place Incised, var. un¬ 
specified., Plaquemine Brushed, var. Plaquemine, and L’Eau Noire Incised, var. 
L’Eau Noire. 


Cluster 5 

This cluster contains all of the highly grog-tempered sherds. With a larger 
sample size it might be possible to subdivide this cluster, but for now it is left 
undifferentiated. The sherds in this cluster have between 8 percent and 21 
percent grog and less than 1 percent shell. This cluster includes four examples 
of Plaquemine Brushed, var. Plaquemine, two examples of Anna Incised, var. 
Anna, one sherd of Addis Plain, var. Addis, and one sherd of Mazique Incised, 
var unspecified. 

If we assume that these clusters are at least partially correct, what is the 
significance? First, these clay types correspond fairly well to variations in vessel 
function, which suggests that there may have been widely shared notions that 
different ratios of grog, shell, and clay were appropriate for different applica¬ 
tions. The clays in clusters 2 , 3 , and 4 were used almost exclusively for serving 
vessels (plates and shallow bowls and decorated varieties such as Anna Incised, 
Carter Engraved, L’Eau Noire Incised, Mound Place Incised, D’Olive Incised) 
and the clays in clusters iA and iC were used exclusively for utilitarian vessels. 



124 


PATRICK C. LIVINGOOD 


The clays in clusters iB, 4 , and 5 were used for mixed purposes. Note that 
there is not a good correspondence between decorative type and cluster. For 
example, there were six Anna Incised, var Anna sherds in the sample that were 
constructed using temper combinations from three clusters. Likewise, the five 
sherds of Plaquemine Brushed, var. Plaquemine span two clusters, the three 
sherds of Grace Brushed, var. Grace span two clusters, and the three sherds of 
D’Olive Incised, var D’Olive span two clusters. 

Second, this study found a fairly strong association between high total tem¬ 
per abundance (grog plus shell) and utilitarian tasks while the majority of 
presumed serving wares have low total temper abundance. This may be ex¬ 
plained functionally: coarsely tempered vessels may perform better in cooking 
and storage tasks. It may also be explained aesthetically: Pearl River potters 
seemed to prefer a more uniform, polished, “temperless” look for serving ware 
vessels. 

Finally, the data suggest that there were a greater number of temper com¬ 
binations being used than were described by the original fabric types bor¬ 
rowed from the LM V Furthermore, the clusters do not map very well to these 
existing plainware varieties, as shown in Table 6. 2 . This might indicate that 
there were different tempering practices being used in the middle Pearl be¬ 
cause of cultural or ecological differences or it might indicate the expected 
lack of correspondence between macroscopic and microscopic categories. In 
trying to apply these established types, it is interesting to observe that very 
few samples are completely lacking in grog or shell and there appears to be no 
real analytical difference between samples that contain trace amounts and 
those for which a temper is absent. Therefore, the distinction between Addis 
Plain, var Addis and Addis Plain, var. Greenville does not seem very important 
for this assemblage. Flowever, the ratio between grog and shell and the relative 
abundance of both do seem to be important. Sherds with lots of shell or lots 
of grog get assigned to clusters 1 or 5 , respectively. The remaining sherds get 
classified according to whether they are almost “temperless” (cluster 3 ) or con¬ 
tain slightly more shell than grog (cluster iC), slightly more grog than shell 
(cluster 4 ), or about equal amounts of both (cluster 2 ). 

Conclusion 

These results provide empirical evidence that the frustrated efforts to classify 
the Pearl River ceramics using the four paste categories of Addis Plain, var 
Addis, Addis Plain, var. Greenville, Mississippi Plain, and Bell Plain were like 
trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. In reality, the categories I should 
be using rely more on observing the ratio between grog and shell temper.

Like many studies, this one raises more questions than it answers. Many of 
the questions can probably be answered by increasing the sample size. For 
example, it would be interesting to see whether an expanded sample from the 
Pearl River would sharpen the focus of the plots and reveal several closely 
related temper recipes or whether an expanded sample would blur the rela-

tionships and indicate that grog and shell were added haphazardly. It would 
also be interesting to apply these analyses to other regions in the Plaquemine 
world where grog and shell tempers are frequently mixed to find out whether 
potters there were making choices similar to those of the Pearl River potters.

Feasting on the Bluffs 

Amina Site Excavations in the Natchez Bluffs 
of Mississippi 

Virgil Roy Beasley III 


Recent years have seen an explosion of archaeological theorizing regarding the 
nature and role of feasting in various cultures and societies (Dietler and Hay¬ 
den 2001 ). Much of this literature has focused on obligation, power, and dis¬ 
play, often as a correlate of commensal politics, chiefly influence, and dichoto¬ 
mies of superior/inferior (Blitz 1993 ; Costin and Earle 1989 ; Dietler 2001 ; 
Hayden 2001 ; Jackson and Scott 1995 ; Joffe 1998 ; Kelly 2001 ; Knight 2001 ; 
Kolb 1994 ; Pauketat et al. 2002 ; Perodie 2001 ; Phillips and Sebastian 2004 ; 
Smith and Williams 1994 ; VanDerwarker 1999 ; Welch and Scarry 1995 ). More 
recently, attention to the relationship between feasting behavior and identity 
has become an element of this discourse. Feasts provide an ideal arena for 
expressions of identity, being a locus of symbolically charged items such as 
food and ceramics (Weismantel 1988 : 7 ) and due to the ability of hosts to 
select those persons who are allowed to attend certain feasts. The intersection 
between material culture and practice associated with feasting behavior pro¬ 
vides an opportunity for archaeologists to directly explore an essential dy¬ 
namic of social interaction. 

Feasting occurs in diverse social contexts and the material signatures of 
feasts are recognizable archaeologically. Many of these contexts indicate power 
asymmetries, overt and subtle. However, apical relations are not a necessary 
condition of feasting behavior. Visibility is not a compulsory feature of hier¬ 
archical structures. Feasting occurs in a variety of political and economic or¬ 
ganizations. It is this diversity in the kinds and contexts of feasting behavior 
that allows for varied and rich theoretical perspectives. 

In this chapter I present the evidence for a small feast at the Anna site in 
southwest Mississippi (Figure 7 . 1 ). The Anna site is one of the largest of the 
Plaquemine culture (a.d. 1200 - 1700 ) sites located in the Natchez Bluffs re-

gion (Brown, this volume). Excavations in 1997 north of Mound 4 revealed a 
small mound that was no longer visible from the surface. On one summit of 
this mound an assemblage of animal bone and partial ceramic vessels was 
encountered, argued here to represent the remains of a small feast. A quick 
review of the literature and archaeological perspectives on feasting is pre¬ 
sented, including how identity relates to feasting behavior. This is followed by 
a brief introduction to the Anna site and its place in Plaquemine culture, 
detailing archaeological evidence from one block of the 1997 excavations at 
the Anna site. It is proposed that these remains of a small feast are repre¬ 
sentative of local negotiations of identity. 

Archaeological Perspectives on Feasting 

Feasting is a common feature throughout the world’s societies, with roots that 
may reach back as far as the Upper Paleolithic (Hayden 1998 : 22 ). Such a com-

mon trait has garnered the interest of anthropologists, with numerous refer¬ 
ences to feasting found in the ethnographic literature (e.g., Keesing 1983; 
Leach 1964; Malinowski 1922; Mauss 1990; Swanton 1931; Walens 1981; We¬ 
iner 1988), though only a few studies have examined feasting in a theoretical 
or cross-cultural light (Dalton 1977; Dietler and Hayden 2001; Mauss 1990; 
Rappaport 1968; Suttles 1968). Much more recently, archaeologists have begun 
to express an interest in this phenomenon and the insight such activity can 
provide toward questions of developing social complexity (Clark and Blake 

1994) , status (Kelly 2001; Smith and Williams 1994; VanDerwarker 1999; 
Welch and Scarry 1995), aboriginal economics and warfare (Costin and Earle 
1989; Dalton 1977; Kolb 1994), performance and display (Costin and Earle 
1989; Kelly 2001; Knight 2001; Kolb 1994; Pauketat et al. 2002), and cultural 
ecology (Hayden 1998). In concert with this growing interest, archaeologists 
have developed new and innovative techniques to investigate feasting in such 
areas as ceramic analysis (Blitz 1993; Welch and Scarry 1995), faunal studies 
(Jackson and Scott 1995), and archaeobotanical research (Welch and Scarry 

1 995 ) - 

Though often differing in considerations of scale and participants’ social 
distance, various attempts to define what is a feast tend to share the attribute 
of “communal consumption of food/drink” and feasts are distinguished from 
daily meals and exchange of food goods without associated consumption 
(Dietler and Hayden 2001:3). In the 2001 volume, both Dietler and Hayden 
provide specific definitions of feasting, with Dietler highlighting the ritual 
aspect of feasting and the shared consumption often accompanied by per¬ 
formances and social transactions. Hayden takes the more liberal view of any 
atypical shared meal being a feast. Generally, it appears Hayden’s definition 
has gained the greater currency (e.g., Mills 2004). 

Hayden (2001) provides a most thorough typology of feasts, dividing all 
feasts into three major divisions: (1) alliance and cooperation feasts, (2) eco¬ 
nomic feasts, and (3) diacritical feasts. While this segmentation would seem 
to indicate a wide variety in the kinds of feasts encountered archaeologically, 
it is obvious that the majority of feasting literature emphasizes competition 
(often through showiness), politics, asymmetry, and division (e.g., Blitz 1993; 
Costin and Earle 1989; Dietler 2001; Hayden 2001; Jackson and Scott 1995; 
Joffe 1998; Kelly 2001; Knight 2001; Kolb 1994; Pauketat et al. 2002; Perodie 
2001; Phillips and Sebastian 2004; Smith and Williams 1994; VanDerwarker 
1999; Welch and Scarry 1995), though it would be a gross misstatement to 
characterize all feasting literature in this manner (e.g., Potter and Ortman 
2004; Wilson and Rathje 2001). 



130 


VIRGIL ROY BEASLEY III 


This emphasis on feasting as political discourse provides a fertile field from 
which to reap insights into social interaction and practice. However, this focus 
has a tendency to create a situation in which competition is expected as a com¬ 
ponent of feasting behavior. Perhaps there always is competition—observe a 
modern family reunion, church picnic, or barbeque and you will certainly find 
sport in food presentation and quality—but archaeologically, the expectation 
is that the competition has meaning in politics and cultural evolution. The 
sharing of food and drink, as a component of togetherness, rather than dis¬ 
tinction, is lost. 


Archaeology, Identity, and Feasting 

Identity as a conceptual framework holds tremendous potential in archae¬ 
ology. Defined here as the acknowledgment/expression of social and/or cul¬ 
tural sameness, identity shares some of the characteristics of what is tradi¬ 
tionally thought of as archaeological systematics (e.g., cultures and phases). 
However, identity differs in that while it is often expressed materially, the 
scale of expression can range widely from a family group to a nation-state, or 
even the entire planet (“I am a citizen of Planet Earth”), and it is based, at 
least theoretically, on emic notions instead of assigned classifications. While 
we cannot make simplistic assumptions that shared material culture equals 
shared identity (Mills 2004; Shennan 1994), the often strong correspondence 
between the two, especially when multiple classes of artifacts, context, and 
timing are considered, provides an ideal opportunity for exploring this basic 
human phenomenon. Identity as a construct allows for comparison of a be¬ 
havior that produces a recognizable material signature, for example, feasting, 
cross-culturally and intra-culturally. 

Given that identity is an integral part of life, be it personal, political, re¬ 
ligious, ideological, or even avocational, it is no surprise that food and feast¬ 
ing are strongly expressive of belonging. Food, as a necessary condition of life, 
is the economic product around which much of the material universe revolves. 
Food is the central fruit of our labors. Consumables and related material para¬ 
phernalia thread through many social interactions. Food is “sign, symbol, and 
product” (Weismantel 1988:7), having perhaps the greatest malleability in 
practice. Certain acts of sharing food are recognized as feasting and the ma¬ 
terial remains of feasting behavior are recoverable archaeologically (Dietler 
and Hayden 2001). Nearly all levels of social complexity likely carry out the 
practice of feasting, though Hayden (2001:54) has doubts about generalized 
hunter-gatherers. Combining the ubiquity of feasting behavior with the con-

struct of identity provides opportunity for robust and meaningful compari¬ 
sons across and within cultures. 

The Anna Site 

The Anna site (22AD500) is one of the largest of all the Natchez Bluffs 
Plaquemine sites. Material and geographical continuities indicate that Anna 
is likely one of several sites that were occupied by predecessors to the famed 
historic Natchez (Brain 1978; Brown 19980:57). 

Within the area presently defined as the site, a minimum of eight visible 
earthen mounds occur, ranging from approximately 2 m high to about 16.5 m 
(Figure 7.2). This study adds another small mound, not visible from the sur¬ 
face, to the inventory. Due in large part to the nature of the terrain, the site 
has never been accurately surveyed and mapped in total. Jesse Jennings and 
C. A. Wagner produced the most complete and reliable map in 1940, a sketch 
map with elevations established for mound heights. The site has changed 
somewhat since their survey, the most drastic cultural alteration being a re-

routing of Pine Ridge Road, which now splits the area between Mounds 3 
and 4 (Figure 7.2). 

In the Natchez Bluffs region, the most striking physiographic features are 
the extremely dissected loess bluffs. These bluffs, which are composed of a 
finely grained, velvety soil, date to the Pleistocene and are believed to be aeo- 
lian in origin (Saucier 1994:186). It is the nature of the loess that has most 
visibly impacted the Anna site. When tree cover is removed, the leaching out 
of calcium causes the soil to lose cohesion, and erosion can be severe. Loess 
that has not been weathered can maintain a vertical slope if protected from 
surface runoff, but weathering creates an acute situation of erosion suscepti¬ 
bility (Saucier 1994:185). Gaping ravines encircle and cut through the site and 
await the diligent soul who ventures into the surrounding forest. These ravines 
have destroyed some portion of the original site and have surely resulted in 
the destruction of valuable archaeological contexts. Although this erosion was 
greatly accelerated by the removal of tree cover in the mid-nineteenth century 
and by plow agriculture since then (Neitzel 1983:19), the bluffs were probably 
of higher relief in prehistoric times. Modern agricultural and forestry practices 
have only accelerated a preexisting condition. 

This pattern of bluff tops and ridges combined with large ravines may have 
affected settlement, as the lack of large expanses would have predicated the 
need for a dispersed farmstead pattern. The Mississippi River floodplains do 
provide large, flat expanses. However, archaeological surveys have not system¬ 
atically covered these areas or the talus slopes. It is possible given local erosional 
tendencies that many sites are covered in colluvium. 

Elsewhere in the Plaquemine culture area, evidence points toward limited 
occupation of the principal sites, with the majority of population scattered 
throughout the countryside, in contrast to Mississippian sites to the north 
(Brown 198513:253). Unfortunately, in the Natchez Bluffs area, no one mound 
site and its surroundings have been so thoroughly sampled as to make a sup¬ 
portable conjecture as to the settlement pattern. The non-mound site of Look¬ 
out was intensively investigated and appears to be a small village with an as¬ 
sociated cemetery (Brown 19853:56). Future sampling of sites such as Anna 
may provide better answers to the question of whether the large mound sites 
in the Natchez Bluffs region represent inhabited villages or abandoned cere¬ 
monial centers, where the majority of the population lived away from the site 
(Williams and Brain 1983:340). Work in the Lower Big Black River basin sup¬ 
ports the dispersed settlement model, with small sites, possibly hamlets, scat¬ 
tered along the river (Johnson 1997). 

Various archaeologists working under the auspices of the Lower Mississippi

Survey have extensively surveyed the region, including the Yazoo Basin, the 
Tensas Basin, and the Natchez Bluffs, areas that differ physiographically but 
are culturally similar (Brain 1978:332-334; Brain et al. 1994; Brown 1985a; 
Brown and Brain 1983; Phillips et al. 1951). Within the Natchez Bluffs region, 
there are over 125 recorded sites with at least some representation of Native 
American populations, but the archaeology on the preponderance of these is 
extremely limited (Brain et al. 1994). The majority of professionally excavated 
sites are mound sites (e.g., Fatherland, Emerald, Feltus), but there are excep¬ 
tions (Brown 1985a). While this scarcity of information makes large-scale in¬ 
terpretations and explanations very difficult, it emphasizes the need for future 
research in the region. 

Previous Investigations at the Anna Site 

The Anna site was well known to scholars who made their homes in the 
Natchez region or visited it in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries 
(Brown 1926:40-42; Brown 1997:19-20; Culin 1900:124-127; Moorehead 
1932:162-163). Several different names have been applied to the site, includ¬ 
ing the Voucherie group (B. L. C. Wailes in Brown 1996), the Robson group 
(C. Brown 1992), the Lewis group, the Stowers group (Brown 1997), and the 
Anna group (Brown 1926:40-42; Brown 1996). Despite this widespread rec¬ 
ognition of the importance and immensity of the site, very little archaeology 
beyond artifact acquisition took place in these early years. B. L. C. Wailes, a 
noted scholar and recorder of Native American remains in the Natchez re¬ 
gion, made a cursory visit to the site in April 1853, giving one of the best 
descriptions of the era (Brown 1998a). Warren K. Moorehead, in the company 
of Calvin S. Brown, conducted excavations at the site in 1924, opening up a 
minimum of five units in various locations throughout the site (Moorehead 
1924, 1932). At least one of the units excavated was in Mound 4, the area 
of which this chapter is primarily concerned. Calvin Brown gives a descrip¬ 
tion of some of the Moorehead excavations, contributing measurements of 
the mounds and relating a brief description of the materials found in Mound 
4, deferring the more intensive report to Moorehead (Brown 1926:40-42). 
Unfortunately, Moorehead, in typical fashion, provides only a fleeting de¬ 
scription of his activities at Anna, mentioning his excavations into Mounds 
4 and 6 and giving a brief account of the cultural materials found in Mound 
4. Moorehead refers the reader to Calvin Brown’s work for further details 
(Moorehead 1932:162-163). 

James A. Ford made a surface collection at the site sometime prior to 1936, 
probably stemming from his earlier work in the area with Henry B. Collins. 



134 


VIRGIL ROY BEASLEY III 


This collection was illustrated by Ford (1936:111) and placed within his Tunica 
complex. Ford mentions that ravines surrounded the site but notes no further 
damage or alterations. Jesse Jennings, working under the auspices of the Na¬ 
tional Park Service’s Natchez Trace Parkway project, visited the site in 1939 or 
1940. In his unpublished report to the National Park Service, Jennings notes 
that the owner had opened Mound 5 for the purposes of a silage trench. Silage 
is a type of feed given to cattle that is made from fodder that is fermented. 
Jennings recommended that the site undergo further archaeological work, be 
acquired by the National Park Service, and be converted into a public park 
with a museum (Jennings 1940:5—11). These recommendations were never 
achieved, and the site received no professional attention for almost a decade. 
Philip Phillips visited the site in 1947 and noticed that two of the mounds, 1 
and 5, had been opened up for silage trenches (Brain et al. 1994). Phillips 
suggested that Mound 5 be professionally excavated and John Cotter, Jen¬ 
nings’s successor with the National Park Service, followed up on this sugges¬ 
tion in 1948. At that time, Cotter opened up a 5-by-io-foot unit in the south 
wall of the silage trench in Mound 5 (Cotter ca. 1950:3). 

Cotter’s work led to the only detailed publication of archaeological excava¬ 
tions conducted at Anna, an American Antiquity article dealing with strati¬ 
graphic tests at the Anna and Emerald sites (Cotter 1951a). The landowner had 
discovered 15 whole or partial vessels during his trenching of Mound 5. Cot¬ 
ter’s excavations revealed at least four stages of mound construction, all except 
the last capped by a distinct occupational surface including evidence of struc¬ 
tures (Brain et al. 1994; Cotter 1951a). Ceramic classification and seriation 
were the main purposes of Cotter’s work, and the excavations at Anna helped 
to provide the basis for the Natchez Bluffs chronology. The material recovered 
by Cotter was reanalyzed by Vincas P Steponaitis using the type-variety sys¬ 
tem prevalent in the area today (Phillips 1970; Steponaitis 1981, 1995) and 
incorporated into Ian W. Brown’s section on the Anna site in the Lower Mis¬ 
sissippi Survey volume (Brain et al. 1994). The results obtained by the Lower 
Mississippi Survey have supported and refined Cotter’s original conjectures. 

Importance of the Anna Site in Prehistory 

As one of the largest sites in the Lower Mississippi Valley (LMV), Anna has 
been accorded great significance in the prehistory of the region. On the basis 
of Cotter’s Mound 5 excavations (Cotter 1951a), it appears that the first sub¬ 
stantial occupation of the site occurred during the Anna phase (a.d. 1200- 
1350; Figure 7.3). The 1997 excavations reveal at least some Balmoral phase 
occupation (Beasley 1998). The Anna phase is the initial expression of Plaque-

mine culture, known as a variant of the Mississippian cultural tradition 
(Brown 1985b). Plaquemine culture, which has been termed “Mississippian- 
ized Coles Creek” by Brain (1978:345), is surprisingly tough to define. For 
some, while material culture and practice differ, there is no qualitative differ¬ 
ence between Plaquemine and Mississippian (Steponaitis 1998:15). Plaque- 
mine is characterized by a substantial increase in mound-building activities 
and perhaps a greater emphasis on beans, maize, and squash agriculture. For 
much of the Plaquemine area, shell tempering of pottery is always in a mi¬ 
nority, and burial treatments rarely approach the sumptuousness of Cahokia, 
Moundville, or Etowah. Williams and Brain (1983) distinguish a general de¬ 
crease in Mississippian ceramic traits as one progresses south. Increasing popu¬ 
lation and an expansion of major centers such as Anna occurred throughout 
the region, perhaps reflective of the new subsistence base (Brown 198 5b: 254). 

Because Anna is the largest site in the Natchez Bluffs during the Anna 
phase, it has been hypothesized that the site was the apex of a multitier hier¬ 
archy characteristic of a complex chiefdom (Brain 1971b, 1978). Unfortunately, 
despite the large amount of survey and archaeology carried out within the 
region (Brain et al. 1994), there is not enough information to either support 




















136

or refute this hypothesis. Recently, scholars have again questioned the idea 
that the historic Natchez Indians were organized into a complex chiefdom 
(Lorenz 1997; Muller 1997:63-68), an assumption long taken for granted by 
archaeologists (Brain 1978; Knight 1990a; Steponaitis 1978). While Lorenz and 
Muller fail to take into account several factors in their analysis, most signifi¬ 
cantly the influence of two different European powers attempting to manipu¬ 
late native alliances, the caution is warranted. Only with a much more careful 
examination of the settlement data at hand and improved recovery at the pre¬ 
sumed lower-order centers can such hypotheses be supported. 

1997 Block 1 Excavations 

Mound 4 and the accompanying “flats” are topographically a bluff remnant 
formed by road construction and erosion that has bisected the original site. 
This remnant was chosen for excavation on the basis of a number of factors. 
The first of these considerations was that while the road cut and erosion have 
seriously deflated the area surrounding Mound 4 and the flats, what remains 
appears to be fairly intact. Earlier exploratory investigations by Ian Brown and 
Richard Fuller had revealed the presence of large amounts of daub and pot¬ 
tery fragments in the eastern cut, known as the Old Spanish Road. The main 
intention of the 1997 project was to recover architectural information that 
would expand our knowledge of Plaquemine culture house types (Brown 
1997:4, 1985b). With these factors in mind, it was determined that this area 
would be an excellent candidate for excavation. A 34-by-i4-m grid was laid 
out on a magnetic north-south axis and soil probe tests were conducted every 
4 m. The tests revealed a concentration of daub and artifacts in the area be¬ 
tween the N24W00-N32W00 stakes and the N24W08-N32W08 stakes. Soil 
probe testing was followed by shovel testing to the edge of the areas where 
artifact concentrations were found. The shovel tests produced an insight into 
the stratigraphy and provided us with an estimate of the depth to subsoil. The 
combination of surface collections, soil probe testing, and shovel testing en¬ 
abled us to place an 8-by-8-m block where it had the best chance of yielding 
architectural remains. 

The excavation block (Block 1) was divided into 2-by-2-m squares and each 
square was given a numerical designation. Two units were initially selected for 
excavation, G211 and G213. Each of these units was excavated using arbitrary 
10-cm levels. G213 consisted entirely of a dark brown-black midden soil, with 
abundant bone, charcoal, daub fragments, and pottery. The base of G211 re¬ 
vealed the presence of four small post features in a linear arrangement, con¬ 
tained within an arc of yellowish-brown soil. This was thought to indicate a

structure, and the ensuing excavation strategy was aimed at attempting to 
follow out this pattern. 

As more units were opened, it became apparent that there was a detectable 
pattern to the yellow-brown soil. Eventually it was found that this distinct soil 
formed a general oval pattern (Figure 7.4). This was thought initially to indi¬ 
cate either a structure or perhaps a soil cap placed over an earlier structure. 
The excavation strategy continued to be horizontal in nature, attempting to 
expose as much of the yellow-brown soil as possible. Each subsequent unit 
excavated was brought down to the top of this soil level. In unit G214, there 
were multiple partial vessels found smashed on an occupational surface in 
situ. The type-variety classification of these vessels, one Chicot Red, var 
Fairchild bowl (Figure 7.5) and one Addis Plain, var Addis bowl (Figure 7.6), 
indicates that this yellow-brown surface was at one time an activity area dat¬ 
ing to the Foster phase (a.d. 1350-1500). Several large mammal bones were 
also found on this surface (Table 7.1). Several concentrations of daub were 
found throughout the units, some fragments being quite substantial. 

Plowever, as no other structural indications were found, the initial assump¬ 
tion that this yellow-brown surface was related to a structure was questioned. 
Unit G216 was brought down further and a layer of daub was found, but 
without further structural information. Pottery sherds were found at various 
angles throughout the yellow-brown matrix, indicating that the area had been 
filled with soil over a relatively brief temporal span and was not the result of 



138 


VIRGIL ROY BEASLEY III 


gradual accumulation. The area around the yellow-brown soil continued to be 
a dark brown-black soil, thought to be indicative of a midden. While it was 
apparent that the yellow-brown soil indicated a distinct cultural activity, the 
nature of this activity was still unclear. 

After discussion, it was thought that the pitch of the ground surface and 
the nature of soils in the region would be conducive to sheet erosion, wherein 
the combination of rainfall and a small angle will cause large horizontal areas 
of soil to erode. This is apparently what has happened. Part of the original 
surface of the Mound 4 flats has eroded into the Old Spanish Road. Within 
the road cut, large amounts of artifact-rich colluvium can be found that origi¬ 
nated on the flats. This erosion, in addition to limited plowing of the surface 
in historical times, altered the uppermost layers, washing away evidence of the 
latest activities. Also, it was speculated that the yellow-brown layer was evi¬ 
dence of a dumping episode, not a structure. 

Eventually it was decided to bring unit G216 down further in order to gain 
a better idea of the vertical stratigraphy. This decision proved to be vital to 
explaining the nature of the block. By leaving a balk on the western edge of 
the unit, we were able to get a section for the entire block. This section clearly 
showed that the yellow-brown layer was underlain by several fill layers, all 
overlying a slanting dark fill indicative of mound construction. Just above the 
subsoil, an Anna phase (a.d. 1200-1350) wall trench was found that cut into 
an earlier Coles Creek component of the Balmoral phase. The latter compo¬ 
nent is underlain by the sterile subsoil and is probably indicative of the earliest 
occupation in the Mound 4 flats, although the presence of a few sherds of 
Tchefuncte Plain, var. unspecified indicates an earlier occupation in the vicinity. 
It seems reasonable in light of this information to consider the Block 1 locale 
a small mound, possibly a house mound, of which the uppermost layers have 
been washed away. The yellow-brown layer is a cap of this mound onto which 
further fill was added that has eroded away over the years. 

Within unit G211 were found a series of small post features (Figure 7.4). 
Other than the presence of daub, these features are the only structural indi¬ 
cators on this surface. It is possible that these features represent the remains 
of a small scaffold or screen. The Natchez used such ephemeral structures 
during feasts (Swanton 1911:114-115, 118). Du Pratz, speaking of the Natchez 
harvest feast, describes their construction: “The feast day being fixed, the nec¬ 
essary arrangements for this ceremony are made some days before. The cabin 
of the great chief is built opposite the granary and that of the great war chief 
at the side of this granary. That of the sovereign is on an elevation of earth 
about 2 feet high, which has been brought hither. It is made by the warriors

of grass and leaves” (Swanton 1911:114). Dumont, in describing the same feast, 
also narrates the construction of temporary structures: “Eight days before it 
began [the harvest feast] the savages cut all the grass on the trail over which 
their great chief, who was then the Tattooed-serpent, would have to pass; that 
is to say, for the space of about a league and a half, the distance between the 
great village and this tun [granary]. At the same time, they prepared many 
cabins of branches around a beautiful open space which they had prepared

beside the tun, and at the end of this open space they raised another cabin 
more ornate than all the others, destined to serve as the palace of their chief” 
(Swanton 1911:118). 

Thus, substantial structural remains would not be expected at the scene of 
a feast. The Mound 4, Block 2 locale, also excavated during the 1997 season 
and between the Block 1 locale and Mound 4, revealed the presence of several 
post features. Interestingly, almost all of the smaller, nonstructural post fea¬ 
tures were found to contain fish vertebrae and/or garfish scales (Boudreaux 
1997). Artifacts found within these features date to the Foster phase or later. 
Brown (1997:6) proposes that post features in the Block 2 locale may represent 
an open warm-weather structure. Alternatively, these features could be repre¬ 
sentative of a temporary structure of the type employed by the Natchez dur¬ 
ing feasts (Swanton 1911:114-115,118). 

Stratigraphic Interpretations 

Though not the focus of this study, it is also useful to briefly consider the 
overall excavation block at this point in order to place the deposits in chrono¬ 
logical context. The reader is referred to Beasley (1998) for a fuller discussion. 
The earliest stratigraphic unit at the Mound 4, Block 1 locale occurs in levels 
G216E1-F1. On the basis of the presence of sherds of Beldeau Incised, var. 
Beldeau and Coles Creek Incised, var. Mott, this unit dates to the Balmoral 
phase of the Coles Creek period (Brown 1998b). However, this unit is in¬ 
truded by a wall trench believed to date to the Anna phase and the Balmoral 
phase elements may be of secondary context. The inclusion of three sherds of 
Anna Incised, var. Anna argues for some type of intrusion. Gordon phase 
diagnostics were absent, arguing against this being a transitory deposit. On 
the basis of the available information, the best interpretation is one in which 
an Anna phase structure was placed over and through an earlier Balmoral 
phase component, which represents the premound occupation of this area. 

Units G216C and G216D both contain sherds that are strongly indicative 
of an Anna phase occupation, including Anna Incised, var. Anna, L’Eau Noire 
Incised, var. L’Eau Noire, and Plaquemine Brushed, var. Plaquemine (Steponaitis 
1981, 1995). This dating lends credence to the above interpretations and pro¬ 
vides further insight into the construction sequence of this area. The west and 
south profiles indicate a substantial accretion of detritus that dates to the 
Anna phase occupation, consisting of a structure that appears to extend to¬ 
ward the southeast. The material from this structure, a black clayey silt with 
midden properties, slopes toward the periphery of the excavation block, lend¬ 
ing support to the interpretation of this being a mound. A post feature not 



142 


VIRGIL ROY BEASLEY III 


detected during the horizontal excavation but apparent in the profile was as¬ 
sociated with this wall trench and midden-like deposit. This feature may be 
the remnants of a corner post associated with the Anna phase structure. Rec¬ 
tangular wall-trench patterns are known for the Anna phase (Brown 1985b: 
Figure 10, Table 2, 277), and this type of construction continued to be em¬ 
ployed throughout the Natchez occupation of the area (Brown 19851x277; 
Neitzel i965:Figure 12, i983:Figures 7, 14). 

The initial purpose of these excavations was to recover architectural infor¬ 
mation relating to Plaquemine culture houses. As such, most of the excava¬ 
tions were horizontal in nature, resulting in a large areal exposure but a mini¬ 
mal vertical exposure. The majority of the units, excepting G216, were taken 
down only to the yellow-brown soil change or slightly below. These units, 
which are immediately below the plow zone, date to the Foster phase. Exca¬ 
vation below the initial yellow-brown soil change revealed that the fill below 
also dated to the Foster phase. The few units analyzed that included the plow 
zone (e.g., G216A) tended to represent mixed deposits, although there is a 
substantial representation of Emerald phase materials, which may indicate the 
final occupation of the area. Those units that fell out of the area where the 
yellow-brown soil existed, such as G213B, also tended to contain mixed de¬ 
posits. Plowing of the surface in the early part of this century (J. Hall 1997) 
and continued sheet erosion have created a situation wherein the area around 
the mound has been overlain with a thick zone of eroded soil. Profiles support 
this conclusion, as the dark soil of the plow/erosion zone thickens toward the 
east, which is the lower side of the area and toward the Old Spanish Road. 

The combination of partial vessels and faunal materials discussed earlier 
was found overlying the yellow-brown soil. The artifacts found on this sur¬ 
face, including the Chicot Red, var Fairchild and Addis Plain, var. Addis 
bowls mentioned above, date the deposition of the materials to the Foster 
phase or later. 

Discussion 

The 1997 excavations north of Mound 4 at the Anna site revealed the presence 
of a small mound. On one of the latest summits of the mound, faunal and 
ceramic materials were recovered that are thought to represent the material 
remains of a small feast. Ethnohistoric observations of feasting among the 
Natchez are congruent with the recovered archaeological signature. 

It is the location and scale of this feast that makes arguments of competi¬ 
tion and displays of power difficult to support. Alternatively, if we approach 
this assemblage as the result of a small-scale feast intended to express and

promote identity within one segment of Anna society, such interpretation is 
unnecessary. 

The obvious question is, what group is expressing identity by participating 
in this mound summit feast? Without further research, any answers proposed 
here can only be tentative. The feasts observed by du Pratz and Dumont 
clearly involved a component of identity, with wide-flung members of Natch- 
ezan society traveling to a central location to participate in an event that not 
only demonstrated the position and authority of elites but also served to unite 
people as a means of materializing community. 

The feast described in this chapter involved only a small number of par¬ 
ticipants and was not likely of the scale of the harvest feasts described above. 
Rather, this deposit seems to indicate a few people coming together for a 
single communal meal. The location of the deposit on the summit of a small 
mound indicates that the feast may be associated with the adding of a mound 
mantle, but this again begs the question of why the mound was built. A major 
life event (e.g., death, birth, marriage), the creation of alliances, celebrations, 
or numerous other events could have served as impetus for the mound con¬ 
struction/feast; no single answer is certain without further research. 

Plaquemine Culture and Identity 

While again pushing the margins of this chapter, a brief discussion of Plaque- 
mine culture as an analytical concept seems warranted. After years of uncriti¬ 
cal usage, the notion that Plaquemine is “Mississippianized Coles Creek” 
(Brain 1978; Williams and Brain 1983), a hybridization of indigenous Coles 
Creek people and Mississippian ideas, is at issue (Brown, this volume; Kidder 
1998a; Rees and Livingood, this volume). Unfortunately, such terminology 
obfuscates indigenous contributions. Coles Creek appears as a static entity, 
passively accepting the rising waters of the Mississippian flood. If the LMV 
is merely a receptacle for northern hegemonic practices, local originality, in¬ 
cluding the existence of one of the earliest traditions of mound building 
(Saunders et al. 1997), is lost. Only the porous defense of distance and back¬ 
water swamp provided any protection from the Cahokian juggernaut (Wil¬ 
liams and Brain 1983:411-414). 

Approaching Plaquemine culture as the materialization of identity allows 
us to view constellations of material culture, dispersed settlement pattern, and 
distinctive ideological and ritual practices as analytical units comparable to 
regional Mississippian traditions, such as Moundville, Etowah, and Cahokia, 
rather than a diminished version of a pan-Mississippian phenomenon. Plaque¬ 
mine people seem to have been expressively different from contemporary 



144

groups, whatever the mechanics of “influence.” The historic Natchez are often 
appealed to for models of southeastern chiefly organization, but the archaeo¬ 
logical record does not meet the expectations of chiefdom organization (I. 
Brown 1990; Lorenz 1997; Mason 1964; Rees 1997). It is the individuality of 
Plaquemine that promises the greatest and most immediate research potential. 

Conclusions 

The Anna mound group remains one of the most important sites in North 
America, and the tiny amount of excavation accomplished so far only pro¬ 
vides a tantalizing glimpse of the archaeological potential of the site. The 1997 
excavations detailed here indicate that at least part of the site had some 
Coles Creek occupation, with a continuous usage throughout much of the 
Plaquemine time frame. Results confirm and reinforce earlier chronological 
observations (Cotter 1951a; Steponaitis 1981, 1995), with the final occupation 
occurring during the Emerald phase (a.d. 1500-1650) and no historic Native 
American utilization clearly demonstrated. 

Identity as a theoretical construct holds promise for readdressing the ma¬ 
terial culture of Plaquemine societies at the local and regional levels. By em¬ 
phasizing the materialization of behaviors, small areal excavations can expose 
episodes of deposition and build upon the long practice of ceramic typology 
in the LM V Creating a synthetic description of Plaquemine culture and theo¬ 
rizing the diversity of late protohistoric materializations in the Southeast will 
provide important insights into historically particular routes to complexity.

Plaquemine Culture in the Natchez 
Bluffs Region of Mississippi 

Ian W. Brown 


In this study I explore the archaeological expression of Plaquemine culture 
along the loess bluff hills of southwest Mississippi (Figure 8.1). It was during 
late prehistoric times, circa a.d. 1200-1550, that this region experienced its 
greatest sociopolitical complexity, but the culture itself continued into historic 
times as reflected in the Natchez polity. Plaquemine is known to have devel¬ 
oped in the lower Mississippi River alluvial valley out of the preceding Coles 
Creek culture (Kidder 1998a, i998b:i29-i3o), a vibrant cultural expression 
whose people were some of the first to make use of platform mounds for the 
support of their buildings. 

Ever since James Ford’s publication of Analysis of Indian Village Site Collec¬ 
tions from Louisiana and Mississippi, it has been well known that the Natchez 
Bluffs region has a strong representation of Coles Creek sites (Ford 1936:172- 
216). Even though the Greenhouse site (Belmont 1967; Ford 1951) in the Lower 
Red River region is the site that contributed most to Ford’s definition of this 
culture, the Natchez Bluffs region was recognized early on as one of its major 
expressions. Sites like Feltus (often referred to as Truly or Ferguson; see Brain 
et al. 1994; Brown 1926:45-46, 265; Culin 1900:122-123; Ford 1936:198-199; 
Moorehead 1932:163-164; Phillips 1970:920, 948), Smith Creek (Boggess and 
Ensor 1993; Brain et al. 1994; Ford 1936:193-198; Phillips 1970:920), and Mazique 
(Baca 1989:38; Brain et al. 1994; Brown 1926:34-35; Brown 19983:172; Cot¬ 
ter 1948; Culin 1900:127-128; Frank 1975; Ingraham 1835:2:180; Moorehead 
1932:165; Phelps and Jennings ca. 1940s; Phillips 1970:920; Rowland 1907:1:911, 
1925:1:45, 266-269, 289) are important mound sites in the Natchez Bluffs that 
have produced large numbers of typical Coles Creek pottery (Brown 1998b; 
Ford 1935b, 1936:172-218). But what often goes unrecognized is that these sites 
also have strong Plaquemine components (Phillips 1970:920). As with the

PLAQUEMINE CULTURE IN THE NATCHEZ BLUFFS I47 

Lake George site in the Lower Yazoo Basin (Phillips 1970:278-304; Williams 
and Brain 1983), the thought has tended to be that these Coles Creek towns 
were already in existence prior to Plaquemine development and that there was 
a relatively smooth transition between the two. Presumably Coles Creek people 
received inspiration in some manner from Mississippian societies to the north, 
from Cahokia in particular, and then transformed into something that we 
have come to know as Plaquemine culture (Brain 1978, 1989; Brown 1985b, 
1998c; Brown and Brain 1983; Griffin 1946,1967; Hally 1972; Jennings 1952:267; 
Kidder 199813:130-132; Phillips 1970:967-968; Quimby 1951,1957; Steponaitis 
1981; Weinstein 1987a; Williams 1967:9; Williams and Brain 1983). 

Over the years Brain (197^:76-77, 1978:344-350, 1989:122-125; Williams 
and Brain 1983:412-414) has consistently argued that the Plaquemine variant 
of Mississippian, which characterizes much of the Lower Mississippi Valley in 
late prehistory, basically represents a hybridization of Coles Creek and Mis¬ 
sissippian cultures. If indeed one finds a strong local mound-building popu¬ 
lation whose sites continue with unbroken occupation and that also exhibits 
material continuities, then it is reasonable to presume that one developed into 
the other. That certainly seems to be the case in the Lower Yazoo Basin (Phil¬ 
lips 1970:12-13,560; Williams and Brain 1983), and it may also be true for the 
Natchez Bluffs, but it is important to recognize that the transition between 
Coles Creek and Plaquemine in the Natchez Bluffs is really not as clear as 
might be expected. 

The Historic Expression of Plaquemine Culture 

Let us start by examining the historic manifestation of Plaquemine culture in 
the Natchez Bluffs. The name for the region highlights the fact that the 
Natchez Indians were the last hurrah of Plaquemine culture (Barnett 1998; 
Brain 1978; Brown 1998c, 1998c; Oswalt and Neely 1999; Quimby 1942; Stern 
1977). Spanish and French explorers were fascinated by the complex social and 
political structure of the protohistoric and historic Natchez (Albrecht 1946, 
1948; Brain 1971b; Brown 1982a, 1989b, 1992; Clayton et al. 1993; Fischer 1964; 
Hart 1943; Knight 1990b; Loren 1995; Lorenz 1997; Quimby 1946; Steponaitis 
1978:421-423; Tooker 1963; White et al. 1971). French adventurers were wont 
to draw comparisons between the Great Sun of the Natchez and Louis XIV, 
France’s own Sun King, but just how great was the Great Sun? 

As a result of work by James A. Ford, Robert S. Neitzel, Moreau B. Cham¬ 
bers, Andrew C. Albrecht, George I. Quimby, and others, we know that the 
Fatherland site was most certainly the Grand Village of the historic Natchez 
(Albrecht 1944; Barnett 1998:4-8; Brown I998a:i75-i76,1998b; J. Brown 1990;

Ford 1935b, 1936:59-64; Green 1936; Lorenz 1997:106; Neitzel 1964, 1965, 
1978, 1981,1983; Phillips 1970:948-949; Quimby 1942,1953; Steponaitis et al. 
1983; Williams 1962,1966, 2003:xiii, xvi-xvii). In the early eighteenth century 
it was the principal town of the Natchez nation and, as such, it has received 
great attention in the writings of Le Page du Pratz (1758,1972 [1774]), Dumont 
de Montigny (1753), and other French writers (Delanglez 1935; French 1869; 
Giraud 1974; McWilliams 1988; Rowland and Sanders 1927,1929; Rowland et 
al. 1984a, 1984b; Surrey 1968; Swanton 1911). 

Despite the fact that Fatherland has received an inordinate amount of at¬ 
tention historically and archaeologically, it really is a rather small and unas¬ 
suming site. Three mounds were built on the banks of what was once a shal¬ 
low, gently flowing St. Catherine Creek. In historic times only two mounds 
were in use, with Mound B supporting the Great Sun’s house and Mound C 
the temple. A small plaza stretched between these two edifices. Mound A 
seems to have been retired by historic times. According to Lewis et al. (1998:5), 
Fatherland fits the definition of a “Mississippian town,” which consists of a 
number of mounds arranged around a public arena and substantial evidence 
of habitation. A “Mississippian mound center,” in contrast, is a planned site 
that exhibits earthworks but yields little to no evidence of occupation. I do 
not mean to imply that Fatherland was ever a large town, though, as Neitzel 
(1983) certainly was hard pressed to discover houses between the mounds. 
FFowever, he did detect some evidence of habitation—enough to show that 
there was indeed a resident population. 

The French were impressed with the Great Sun and his perceived power, 
but they really could not have been overly excited by the town of this noble 
and of his brother the Tattooed Serpent. One wonders just how powerful the 
Natchez suns really were, especially considering the frequency of infighting. 
The related nobles at the White Apple, Jenzenaque, and Grigra villages always 
seemed to have been flexing their muscles over something or other (Albrecht 
1946; Brain 1976; I. Brown 1990:235; Lorenz 1997; Swanton 1911:186-257). 
Most students of the region have tended to lean toward the observed faction¬ 
alism as having been primarily a product of the turbulent seventeenth and 
eighteenth centuries, as French and English agents wrestled for Indian alle¬ 
giance (Brain 1976; Brain et al. 1994; Brown 1982a, 1985a, 1989a, 1989b, 1992; 
Crane 1929; Neitzel 1965:55-57; Quimby 1946). European influences are thought 
to have literally torn the social and political order apart in the early eighteenth 
century, but that alone cannot explain the presence of factions. 

The prominence of the Fatherland site and its noble family should really 
be considered the last blip of what was probably a normal Plaquemine politi- 



PLAQUEMINE CULTURE IN THE NATCHEZ BLUFFS 


149 


cal process (Lorenz 1997; Muller 1997:63-68, 1998:185). Too often we tend to 
forget that the historic mounds at Fatherland are but the end product of a long 
history of construction and usage (J. Brown 1990; Neitzel 1965). It is impor¬ 
tant to remember that Fatherland was continuously occupied for over five 
centuries before its abandonment in 1730. Although there was significant 
habitation at Fatherland during the Anna phase, between a.d. 1200 and 1350, 
mound construction does not appear to have begun until the following Foster 
phase, between a.d. 1350 and 1500. It is extremely doubtful, however, that 
Fatherland was a prime center in the region until late in its history. 

Emerald, Anna, and the “Bubbling Porridge” Model 

Far more important than Fatherland in the Natchez Bluffs region between 
a.d. 1200 and 1500 were sites like Emerald and Anna. Emerald is located along 
the Natchez Trace at the headwaters of Fairchilds Creek, while Anna is situ¬ 
ated about 10 miles north of the city of Natchez on a bluff top overlooking 
the Mississippi River’s alluvial valley. Over the years there has been consider¬ 
able archaeological literature relating to these two sites, but we have still just 
barely come to terms with their overall significance. 

Emerald is by far the more imposing of the two sites (Brain i978:Figure 
12.6; Brain et al. 1994; Brown 1926:36-40, 256-264; Brown 198513:266; Cot¬ 
ter 1951a; Cotter, ed. 1951; Moorehead 1932:161-162; Phillips and Brown 1978: 
204-205; Steponaitis 1974). Its base mound is just shy of being the largest 
mound structure in the United States, second only to Monks Mound at Ca- 
hokia. Part of the reason Emerald is so spectacular perhaps has to do with an 
overzealous National Park Service restoration program in the late 1940s, but 
its grandness is also related to the fact that a natural hill was incorporated in 
the construction of the enormous base mound. The large secondary mound 
that was built upon the western end of the base mound is comparable in 
height to the principal mound at Anna. Emeralds construction began circa 
a.d. 1200 in Anna phase times, with additional stages having been added dur¬ 
ing the Foster and Emerald phases. Anna’s occupational history overlaps Em¬ 
erald’s as it, too, is known to have had mound construction that began during 
the Anna phase and continued through both the Foster and Emerald phases. 
There is also some evidence for a very slight historic Natchez Indian occupa¬ 
tion at Anna (Beasley 1998; Brain 1978; Brain et al. 1994; Brown 1926:40-42; 
Brown 198513:265-266,198913:17-19,1997,1998a:i73-i74; Cotter 1951a; Downs 
2004; Ford 1936:111,114, Figure 22k-s; Frank 1980a; Moorehead 1932:162-163; 
Warhop 2005). 

So which of these two towns supported the prehistoric and protohistoric 



150 


IAN W. BROWN 


Great Suns? I suspect that they both did, but at different times as power 
bounced back and forth between the two. Even while Anna was the residence 
of one such Great Sun, it is probable that Emerald and other Plaquemine 
towns in the region had nobility who were continually vying for power, su¬ 
preme or otherwise. In An Archaeology of the Soul, Robert Hall has likened 
Mississippian towns to “city-states governed by all-powerful hereditary rulers 
who would have been known as princes had the seats of their authority been 
located in France or Italy” (R. Hall 1997:146). I believe this is certainly appli¬ 
cable to Plaquemine lifeways in the Natchez Bluffs region. Towns like Anna, 
Emerald, Glass (Brain et al. 1994; Brown 1984; Ford 1936:69-71; Moore 1998 
[1911] :4i—48), and Windsor (Brain et al. 1994; Brown I998a:i72-i73) are im¬ 
pressive features on the landscape because of the size of their mounds, but 
that does not mean that they were always enormous. As Blitz and Livingood 
(2004) reveal, the building of mounds at Mississippi period towns is an ex¬ 
tremely complex issue. The structural sequence of mounds at major towns, 
for example, seems to have had a different grammar than that witnessed at 
smaller towns. Moreover, although a large portion of the size of mounds can 
be attributed to duration of site use, perhaps as much as 40 percent, those 
who prefer “powerist” explanations can highlight the fact that as much as 60 
percent of the volume of mounds at the big sites cannot be attributed to 
duration of occupation; other factors were involved. 

For the Natchez region, most of the larger and smaller sites were occupied 
throughout the greater portion of the Mississippi period, but mound con¬ 
struction and usage at these sites seems to have had its ups and downs, or 
rather its ups and not so ups. In essence, the evidence is not supportive of the 
model of a paramount chiefly family that was located at one continually 
dominant town. Rather, the Plaquemine political order in the Natchez Bluffs 
is analogous to a “bubbling porridge” wherein underlying currents continually 
gave rise to air blasts that popped away at the surface. Every once in a while 
one of the bubbles became considerably larger than the others in what appears 
to be a random fashion. And when that happened, the nobility of that par¬ 
ticular bubble ruled for a time of varying duration. If this is a valid model, 
towns like Fatherland, Foster, Gordon, Feltus, and Bayou Pierre, all of which 
have mounds that encircle plazas, may have supported the most powerful po¬ 
tentate at any given time, losing out to other nobles at other sites in future 
generations. No site in the Natchez region seems to have been forever para¬ 
mount. Nor does it appear that smaller towns constantly catered to specific 
sites in a consistent and predictable fashion. 

I do not mean to imply from all of this that I question the overall chiefdom 



PLAQUEMINE CULTURE IN THE NATCHEZ BLUFFS 


151 

concept, as I do not. Clearly, there were both great chiefs and lesser chiefs in 
the Natchez region. We already know this to be the case historically, so it is 
also probably true prehistorically. The nobles who ruled this society, presum¬ 
ably related matrilineally, were distributed across the region in a rather uni¬ 
form fashion. When one chief was greater than the others, for whatever rea¬ 
son, he or she probably received tribute from the others for the time this status 
was enjoyed. The main point to emphasize is that the nobility were all located 
at similarly structured towns. We are not talking about a Moundville here 
(Beck 2003:651-654; Knight and Steponaitis, ed. 1998; Peebles 1978; Stepon- 
aitis 1983; Welch 1991), in which there was one supreme mega-site and all the 
rest paled in comparison. A site like Anna certainly is big, but its perceived 
size is in part related to its physical setting. The narrow confines of the bluff- 
edge landscape would seem to have been a major problem for site growth at 
Anna, but for some reason the mounds did indeed grow large, enormously so. 
This was not an inevitable situation, but the bubbling porridge model does 
provide a fitting explanation for the phenomenon. 

Regional consolidation seems to be a critical component in the formation 
of chiefdoms (Anderson 1996a; Beck 2003:642-643; Blitz 1999; Carneiro 1981; 
Earle 1987,1991,1997; Hally 1996; Milner and Schroeder 1999), and this is also 
true for Plaquemine culture in the Natchez Bluffs. At the same time, a ty¬ 
pology of simple chiefdom versus complex chiefdom really does not work very 
well for the region (Anderson 19941x8,1996b; Blitz 1999; Lorenz 1997; Smith 
1978:494-498; Steponaitis 1978,1991). Robin Beck’s (2003) apical-constituent 
model seems broadly applicable to the Natchez region. This model, which is 
not a chiefdom typology per se, looks at how authority is vested in Mississip¬ 
pi chiefdoms. On one end of the scale is the ultimate apical system in which 
a regional chief delegates authority downward to local-level chiefs. On the 
other end of the scale is the constituent system wherein community leaders 
cede authority upward to the regional leader. The Plaquemine variant of the 
Mississippian tradition, as represented in the Natchez region, fits somewhere 
along the scale, but its actual position no doubt shifted back and forth through 
time. Again, much depended on the leadership capabilities and charisma of 
the various leaders in the respective local towns. 

I basically agree with John Blitz’s (1999) fission-fusion process study, which 
argues that the organizing force of most Mississippi period polities really had 
little to do with efficiently administering regional tribute. Instead, polity for¬ 
mation and settlement patterns were more likely shaped by compromises 
made between the various local communities as each sought to maintain 
maximum autonomy and, at the same time, have mutual security (Blitz 



J 5 2 


IAN W. BROWN 


i 999 ; 589). How to enjoy both freedom and protection simultaneously is a con¬ 
tinuing struggle for societies around the world. Sometimes smaller, less pow¬ 
erful communities learn rather quickly that they have to give up a measure of 
one to obtain the other. 

Under the fission-fusion process, the various Plaquemine towns in the 
Natchez Bluffs could have bubbled forth at any one time and established al¬ 
legiance linkages if the underlying political currents happened to favor them. 
By virtue of the final size of their mounds, I suspect that sites like Anna, 
Emerald, Glass, and Windsor were favored more often than the others. These 
towns grew as various nobles flexed their muscles and as the surrounding lead¬ 
ers of other towns ceded authority to them, not necessarily because the latter 
were happy to do so but because they knew it was in their best interests in 
terms of security. 

Settlement Hierarchy: Where Are the Plaquemine Villages? 

It is important to note that towns are not the only form of Plaquemine set¬ 
tlement that occurs in the Natchez Bluffs region. Although each of the towns 
had a residential population that lived on or around the mounds, most of the 
people resided either in isolated households or in hamlets scattered along the 
many bluff tops and ridges (Brain 1978; Brain et al. 1994; Brown 1973, 1985a; 
Lorenz 1997:106-108; Steponaitis 1978:421-423; see Kidder 1998b for an analo¬ 
gous situation in the Tensas Basin). Almost every little hill in the Natchez 
region sports a Plaquemine sherd or two if one looks hard enough. These 
small residential occupations probably consisted of the houses and outbuild¬ 
ings of one or several families. The inhabitants may have been related, but 
without skeletal data we have no way of knowing for sure. The Lookout site 
is perhaps the best example of a Plaquemine hamlet in the Natchez Bluffs that 
has been excavated (Brown 1983, 19853:11-56, 1985^264-265). The Antioch, 
Trinity, and Greenfield sites are other good examples, but unfortunately they 
have not yielded much in the way of structural evidence (Brown 19853:98-147, 
167-187). 

What we are missing in the Plaquemine setdement system are villages, zones 
of habitation that have substantial populations of related and nonrelated 
families but that lack mounds or plazas. To my knowledge, Plaquemine vil¬ 
lages did not exist in the Natchez Bluffs region. Instead, the settlement hier¬ 
archy starts with the isolated households or hamlets. They, in turn, are be¬ 
lieved to have catered to nearby towns that supported the local nobility. At 
any given time, a number of these towns (not necessarily always the same 
ones) probably also offered their allegiance to yet another town that housed

153 


the then current Great Sun, wherever that might be located. But eventually, 
if they were lucky, some of these subservient towns advanced to “principal 
town” status, and whenever that happened to a particular town it is likely that 
major stages were added to its own mounds. The ritual burial of mounds and 
their associated temple/chiefly structures must have occurred each time that 
power transference occurred at a town. The archaeology suggests that this was 
a rather frequent occurrence in the Natchez Bluffs region. Of course a big 
question is whether it was possible to have stages applied to mounds when a 
specific town did not serve as the principal seat of government. The Father- 
land site alone would seem to argue that this did occur. 

Mortuary Patterns 

Physical anthropology would obviously help a lot in examining sociopolitical 
connections such as shifts in noble lines, but it is doubtful that much data will 
be forthcoming on this matter. First, the political situation of the twenty-first 
century is not really conducive to extensive grave excavation and analysis. It 
is unlikely that we will see much in the way of research programs directed at 
reconstructing regional burial patterns. And second, past research has already 
demonstrated that the mortuary behavior of the Plaquemine people is uneven 
with regard to archaeological visibility (Brain et al. 1994). For example, it has 
long been recognized that whenever local informants tell us about looters 
finding new burial sites, we do not have to even look at the artifacts to know 
the dates of the burials. Almost all non-mound Plaquemine cemeteries seem 
to occur late in the sequence, primarily during the late Foster, Emerald, or 
Natchez phase. And more often than not, these cemeteries are on hilltops or 
isolated ridges, examples being the Mangum (Bohannon 1963; Brain et al. 
1994; Brain and Phillips 1996:363-364; Cotter 1951b, 1952b; Dailey 1974; Phil¬ 
lips 1970:948; Phillips and Brown 1978:205-206; Spaulding 1941), Burthe 
(Brain et al. 1994; Ford 1936:71; Flally 1972:377-382; S. Williams 1979:21), 
Ring (Brain et al. 1994; Ford 1936:69), O’Quinn (Brain et al. 1994; Brown 
i985a:57-73), and Rice (Brain et al. 1994; Brown i985a:8o-97; Frank 1980b) 
sites. Admittedly, some isolated historic Natchez interments have been found, 
such as at the North site (Brain et al. 1994), but these are rare overall. 

As revealed at Fatherland, the historic Natchez Indians did bury some of 
their dead in mounds, but these interments are believed to have been either 
the elite or their retainers (Barnett 1998:24; Ford 1936:57, 61, 64; Neitzel 
1965:9, 52-54, 93-95; Quimby 1942:262). Burials in mounds occurred in pre¬ 
historic Plaquemine times too, as represented at Glass, Oak Bend Landing 
(Brain et al. 1994; Moore 1998 [19111:38-41; Phillips 1970:945-946), Feltus, 



154 


IAN W. BROWN 


Quitman (Brain et al. 1994; Brown 1926:34,44; Culin 1900:118-122; Moorehead 
1932:165), Emerald (Brain et al. 1994), and Smith Creek. Almost all of these 
sites have one or more of their mounds devoted to the deposition of bodies, 
in either primary or secondary condition. Interestingly enough, we have no 
idea whatsoever of what Coles Creek culture mortuary patterns were like in 
the Natchez Bluffs region. 

Mound Construction 

It may seem curious to the reader that Feltus and Smith Creek are included 
in the distribution of Plaquemine mound sites, seeing that these two sites, 
along with Mazique, were critical to Ford’s (1936:172-218) definition of Coles 
Creek culture. However, work by Harvard’s Lower Mississippi Survey (LMS) 
has revealed that mound construction for at least two of these sites, Feltus and 
Mazique, probably occurred during both Coles Creek and Plaquemine times 
(Brain et al. 1994). Although my colleagues Brain and Steponaitis do not nec¬ 
essarily agree with me, I tend to believe that Plaquemine mound building was 
more dominant at these two sites. There are strong Coles Creek period com¬ 
ponents at all three sites, to be sure, but the diagnostic pottery in the mounds 
could just as easily relate to Coles Creek village debris that ended up as fill. 
My use of the term village simply means that a relatively large number of 
people lived together on the same site in close proximity. As mentioned above, 
a village is different from a “town” in that there are no flat-topped mounds or 
plazas in the former. It is possible that many if not most of the Coles Creek 
components in the Natchez Bluffs fit this definition, as there really are few 
isolated Coles Creek households or hamlets in the region (see also Kidder 
i998b:i3o; Nass and Yerkes 1995). 

Let us look more closely at the dating of mound construction at Feltus, 
Mazique, and Smith Creek. Feltus is known to have had four pyramidal 
mounds definitely, but it could possibly have had as many as seven. Mound 
D, a small mound leveled by Warren K. Moorehead in 1924, yielded eight 
skeletons, as well as large sherds of Fatherland Incised, var. Fatherland’pottery. 
Clearly a portion of the mound was used during or after Emerald phase times, 
but that does not necessarily mean it was constructed at that time (Brown 
1995). We do know from LMS excavations in Mound B that that mound was 
built during or after terminal Coles Creek times, but it is important to note 
that our data come from only two 2-m squares positioned on the flanks of the 
mound (Brain et al. 1994). It is quite possible that there may be an earlier 
Coles Creek construction deep within Mound B. 

The situation as it presently stands is that although a large amount of Coles 



PLAQUEMINE CULTURE IN THE NATCHEZ BLUFFS 


155 


Creek pottery is found at Feltus, there is no clear evidence that Coles Creek 
people actually constructed any of the mounds. Having said that, it is also not 
clear just how much of the mounds were built by Plaquemine residents. It 
should be noted that the plaza between the mounds is absolutely saturated 
with Coles Creek pottery. Considering that plazas in Plaquemine towns are 
usually void of occupational material, the obvious suggestion is that Coles 
Creek occupation at the site occurred before the plaza came into use. I should 
point out, however, that Moorehead might have been responsible for spread¬ 
ing Coles Creek pottery in a portion of the plaza when he leveled Mound D 
in 1924. 

Let us now turn our attention to the Smith Creek site, located near Fort 
Adams in Wilkinson County. Smith Creek consists of three mounds arranged 
around a plaza, with its principal mound situated on a low bluff overlooking 
the Mississippi floodplain. Smith Creek also has its largest mound on the west 
side of the plaza, a structural arrangement identical to both Anna and Feltus 
and that Brain (1978:345) has referred to as a distinctly non-Coles Creek trait. 
J. Ashley Sibley, Jr. (1967) dug four large pits and a 3-m-wide trench in Mound 
B in the 1960s, thereby uncovering a number of skeletons, but the actual dat¬ 
ing of this mound is unclear from his study. 1 

The LMS investigations at Smith Creek (Brain et al. 1994) consisted solely 
of surface collecting on and around the mounds. Although the LMS did in¬ 
deed recover a large amount of Coles Creek pottery, as was typical of earlier 
surveys (Ford i936:Figure 1), a Plaquemine occupation is revealed by the pres¬ 
ence of Addis Plain, Anna Incised, and Plaquemine Brushed types. Test exca¬ 
vations made in the plaza in 1993, beneath what is now a fire department 
building, produced early Coles Creek period pottery almost exclusively (Bog- 
gess and Ensor 1993). In the absence of additional mound excavation, the 
verdict is still out as to whether the visible expression of Smith Creek, that is, 
the mound-and-plaza complex, is Coles Creek, Plaquemine, or both (Phillips 
1970:920). 

For the Mazique site the data are more robust. This site is located along the 
west bank of Second Creek, north of the Homochitto River. At least three 
pyramidal mounds once existed at Mazique (Culin 1900:128) but only two 
survived when Calvin Brown surveyed it in 1916 (Brown 1926:34-35). Even at 
that time the larger of the two mounds was severely damaged by the flow of 
the creek. Additional destruction of this mound occurred later as a result of 
a museum having been established on the so-called White Apple Village 
(Brown 1926:34). The only professional excavations conducted at Mazique 
were by John Cotter and W. P. Lancaster in 1948 in their capacity as National 



156 


IAN W. BROWN 


Park Service archaeologists (Cotter 1948). In a day trip to the site they hap¬ 
pened to observe a thick deposit of village earth lying beneath the principal 
mound, as seen from the creek side. Fortunately, they also excavated some 
pottery from this midden, which was later analyzed by Steponaitis (in Brain 
et al. 1994). Although the sample is small, it contains Addis Plain and Father- 
land Incised sherds, certainly not the kind of material that would be expected 
beneath a supposed Coles Creek mound. Despite the quantity of Coles Creek 
pottery that occurs on the surface of the Mazique site (Ford i936:Figure 1; 
Phillips 1970:948), current evidence, limited as it is, supports only Plaquemine 
mound construction activity. Even the Gordon site, which is the type site for 
the terminal Coles Creek phase in the region, is now known to have had 
its two mounds constructed during Plaquemine times, probably during the 
Emerald phase (Brain et al. 1994; Cotter 1952a; Johnson et al. 1983a, 1983b; 
McCullough 1981; Martinez 1981; Phillips 1970:919-920, 947-948; Walker 
1981). 

So where does that leave us? The four prime “Coles Creek period towns,” 
Feltus, Smith Creek, Mazique, and Gordon, appear to have been Coles Creek 
villages. We cannot say with any confidence that these communities also had 
well-developed mounds and plazas. All of these sites have substantial Coles 
Creek occupation, to be sure, but there is no concrete evidence as yet that 
mound construction occurred to any significant extent in the Natchez Bluffs 
region during the Coles Creek period. It is of course possible that Coles Creek 
mound construction is hidden deep within the cores of the principal mounds, 
so we must keep our minds open to that possibility. 

There are four Plaquemine towns in the region that either lacked Coles 
Creek occupation altogether or had only minimal usage during this period. 
These are the Glass, Yokena (Brain et al. 1994; Ford 1936:234-235), Bayou 
Pierre (Brain et al. 1994; Brookes and Inmon 1973:19-21), and Anna sites. 
Seven other clearly recognized Plaquemine towns do have evidence for some 
Coles Creek occupation, so it is worthwhile looking at each of them to see 
whether they might yield evidence for Coles Creek mound construction. 

We have already considered the Emerald site to some extent. In terms of 
chronology, it is now known that Emerald began as a village during the Gor¬ 
don phase, but the earliest constructional stage of the platform mound dates 
to the Anna phase. The later stages were added during both the Foster and 
Emerald phases (Brain et al. 1994). 

The Windsor site, located in Claiborne County, also exhibits some Coles 
Creek occupation. This site consists of four widely spaced pyramidal mounds 
situated near the edge of the bluffs overlooking both Bayou Pierre and the

Mississippi floodplain. LMS investigations at Windsor in 1971 were limited to 
two 2-m square test units, one in the summit of Mound A and one on its flank 
near the base (Brain et al. 1994). These investigations revealed strong evidence 
for construction and usage of the mound during both the Anna and Foster 
phases. There is a possibility that construction may have begun in the late 
Gordon phase, but that is not certain. We also have no idea of the core con¬ 
struction date of the mound, because our tests were unable to penetrate deep 
enough. 

Continuing to the south, the Pumpkin Lake site consists of one oval 
rounded mound, which once probably was pyramidal (Brain et al. 1994). It is 
situated to the south of Feltus and may originally have been part of that town. 
The LMS excavated a test pit at the base of the Pumpkin Lake mound in 1971. 
Although the site itself is multicomponent, as revealed by abundant pottery 
in the fill (Toth 1988:181), mound construction is believed to have occurred 
during the Emerald phase. 

The Ratcliffe site is located at the headwaters of St. Catherine Creek. One 
pyramidal mound exists at this site, heavily disturbed as the result of Warren 
K. Moorehead’s explorations in 1924. Excavations by the LMS in 1971 revealed 
the mound to have been constructed during the Emerald phase (Brain et al. 
1994 )- 

An Emerald phase construction is also true for at least one of the mounds 
at the Foster site (Brain et al. 1994; Brown 1926:34; Ford 1936:65; Ingraham 
1835:2:219; Phillips 1970:948). Foster is located along the middle reaches of 
St. Catherine Creek in Adams County. The site consists of two pyramidal 
mounds separated by a plaza. Mound B, the smaller mound, located on the 
south end of the plaza, dates to the Emerald phase. Mound A may date earlier 
than Mound B, but we do not know that for sure. 

An LMS crew examined the nearby Flenderson site in 1971. As with Foster, 
Flenderson once had two pyramidal mounds separated by a plaza. The exact 
date of the one surviving mound is unknown, but from pottery in the fill it 
is believed to have been constructed during or after the Gordon phase (Brain 
et al. 1994). 

Finally, we come back to Fatherland, which was the starting point of this 
discussion. Intensive excavations by Neitzel (1965, 1983) revealed Anna phase 
structures beneath Mound B, with construction stages dating to the Foster, 
Emerald, and Natchez phases. Because Mound C, the historic temple mound, 
lacked buildings on its early mantles, dating has been difficult, but it is be¬ 
lieved to have been constructed primarily during the Foster, Emerald, and 
Natchez phases. Despite evidence for some Coles Creek occupation having 



158 


IAN W. BROWN 


occurred at Fatherland, there is no indication that these people constructed 
any of the mounds (Brain et al. 1994; Brown 198513:267-272, I998d). 

In summary, there are four prime Plaquemine towns in the Natchez Bluffs 
region that exhibit major mound construction but that lack significant Coles 
Creek occupation. These are Glass, Yokena, Bayou Pierre, and Anna. An ad¬ 
ditional eight Plaquemine towns have some Coles Creek occupation but have 
yielded no evidence for Coles Creek people having been involved in any form 
of mound construction. These are Windsor, Gordon, Pumpkin Lake, Emerald, 
Ratcliffe, Foster, Henderson, and Fatherland. Finally, three Plaquemine towns 
seem to have been built upon what had earlier been Coles Creek villages— 
Feltus, Mazique, and Smith Creek—but whether the people of these last three 
villages were the direct ancestors of the Plaquemine people in this region has 
not been demonstrated. Mound construction activities would argue other¬ 
wise, but as the cores of most of these mounds have not been penetrated, we 
cannot say for sure. It is worth pointing out, however, that for both Feltus and 
Smith Creek the principal mounds were erected on the west side of the plaza, 
which is a decidedly Plaquemine trait (Brain 1978:345). 2 

With regard to building patterns, I have argued elsewhere (Brown 1985b) 
that there is no clear continuity between circular Coles Creek buildings and 
rectangular Plaquemine structures in the Natchez Bluffs. The circular single¬ 
set post structures of Gordon phase components probably developed out of 
the earlier Coles Creek circular wall-trench structures that have been observed 
in other regions, but they do not seem to continue after a.d. 1200 in the 
Natchez Bluffs. Plaquemine structures tend to be rectangular wall trenches 
almost exclusively until late in the sequence, at which time rectangular single¬ 
set post buildings make an appearance. In short, there seems to be a break 
in building types in the transition from Coles Creek to Plaquemine in the 
Natchez Bluffs region. 

Conclusions 

For years it has been assumed that Coles Creek culture blended rather com¬ 
fortably into Plaquemine culture, what with some helpful stimuli from Mis- 
sissippians to the north. If this was the case for the Natchez region, all that 
can be said at this point is that it was not a comfortable transition from an 
archaeological perspective. I myself believe that we may be dealing with dif¬ 
ferent people, but I should stress that this is not a view necessarily shared by 
my colleagues Brain and Steponaitis. One thing that we do know is that Mis- 
sissippian peoples really did move about the Southeast, a lot it would seem, 
and in their wake they impacted many indigenous populations (Williams 



PLAQUEMINE CULTURE IN THE NATCHEZ BLUFFS 


159 


1994). That much we cannot deny, but when they or their influences moved 
into a new region, the local population did not necessarily “up and die.” It 
should be stressed that the Coles Creek culture, as represented in the Natchez 
Bluffs, was not a mediocre phenomenon. These people lived in substantial 
villages and made a significant and lasting impression on the landscape. Al¬ 
though the peak expressions of Coles Creek culture played out to the north, 
west, and south, its representation in the Natchez Bluffs is quite impressive 
and these are not a people who would have left easily, if they even left at all. 
Did the Coles Creek people of the region give rise to the Plaquemine people, 
both biologically and culturally, or are we dealing with distinct populations? 
That is a big question but, unfortunately, it cannot yet be resolved with the 
data at hand. 

Acknowledgments 

It is to be emphasized that the above thoughts are not necessarily those shared 
by my colleagues Jeff Brain and Vin Steponaitis. I thank them profusely for 
their wisdom, as I have profited immensely from suggestions and critique in 
our many conversations over the years. We have had many friendly arguments 
concerning the relationship of Coles Creek to Plaquemine culture and each 
of us, quite curiously, has occasionally found himself defending opposing 
viewpoints. In the past quarter century I myself have done a 180-degree turn 
in support of Plaquemine mound construction having had dominance over 
Coles Creek in the Natchez region. In sum, the archaeological information 
that is presented here is the product of a team effort, but how that informa¬ 
tion has been handled interpretively in this specific study is my responsibility 
alone. 


Notes 

1. We know that Sibley was the perpetrator of the massive unfilled excavations at 
Smith Creek solely from an interview made in 1971 during the LMS survey (Brain et 
al. 1994). In his book Louisiana’s Ancients of Man Sibley only reports having “con¬ 
ducted numerous training sessions and weekly programs the last ten years” as co¬ 
sponsor and co-organizer of the Junior Archaeological Society (Sibley 1967:72). There 
is no mention of Smith Creek in that volume, beyond its being plotted on Figure 46 
as a Coles Creek site. 

2. Philip Phillips also wrestled with the issue of Coles Creek mound building. He 
offered a similar warning to that which is expressed in this essay, so it is worth revis¬ 
iting his thoughts on the matter: “Re-examination of the situation in period D-C 
(Coles Creek) is more surprising. Of 24 small ceremonial centers listed in table 12,

nineteen are mixed sites with Mississippi period components. Three more are single 
component sites of Coles Creek date, but our information on mound shapes is not 
sufficiently explicit. This leaves only two sites, Green River (13-O-2) and Lessiedell 
(20-M-4)—I hesitate to add that Lessiedell is not above reproach (cf. p. 498)—to 
carry the burden of the argument. Only two ‘large ceremonial centers’ were assigned 
to this period {ibid., table 13). Both have, according to my analysis, Mississippi period 
occupations, and must be left out of account. These distributions, be it noted, do not 
involve the southern half of the Lower Mississippi area where ‘Coles Creek’ and 
‘temple mounds’ have become so firmly associated in archaeological minds. They do 
suggest, however, the exercise of caution in accepting assignments of unexcavated 
rectangular platform mounds to the Coles Creek period, even in this part of the area 
where the proposition is not in serious doubt” (Phillips 1970:964-965).

The Outer Limits of Plaquemine Culture 

A View from the Northerly Borderlands 

Marvin D. Jeter 


Lower Mississippi Valley (LMV) Plaquemine is one of several late prehis¬ 
toric, multiregional cultural variants that archaeologists have generally re¬ 
garded as distinct from, but interacting with, contemporary Mississippians. 
Coeval non-Mississippian archaeological cultures include Caddoan in the 
Trans-Mississippi South (TMS), plus Fort Ancient, Oneota, and Plains Vil¬ 
lage in other areas. These cultures are generally rather vaguely defined and are 
classified mainly on the basis of ceramics. Identifications are often problem¬ 
atic in regions close to Mississippian or other cultural variants. This is cer¬ 
tainly true for the situations summarized here. 

Definitions, Concepts, and Problems 

Interestingly, the impetus for this volume came from denizens of the Louisi¬ 
ana bottomlands, as did the original Plaquemine concept. As Rees and Livin- 
good note in Chapter i, Plaquemine was first published (as “Placquemine”!) 
in two charts derived from James A. Ford’s Louisiana work (Ford and Willey 
i94i:Figures 2 and 5), but it was not really described until the 1950s (Ford 
1951:85-89, iooffi 125, 127-129; Quimby 1951, 1957; cf. Gregory 1969; Neitzel 
1965). By contrast, major publications of the Llarvard-based Lower Missis¬ 
sippi Survey (LMS) downplayed the Plaquemine concept. Ford and his co¬ 
horts operated in a sort of parallel universe, distinct from their LMS col¬ 
leagues and successors, who distanced themselves from Ford on various issues. 

Instead, Phillips (1970) wrote only of Coles Creek and Mississippi as cul¬ 
ture periods, overextending both spatially. Fie referred variously to “Plaque¬ 
mine culture” but avoided the P-word in his minimal discussion of his south¬ 
east Arkansas Bellaire phase (Phillips 1970:944; see below). In a similarly brief 
Fitzhugh phase section (Phillips 1970:945), he referred to relationships with 
“the Plaquemine phase,” also mentioned elsewhere (Phillips 1970:50,560), but 



162 


MARVIN D. JETER 


in the end did not actually name such a phase. Phillips (1970:946-947) also 
suggested that Plaquemine was an outgrowth of Ford’s earlier (1936) Caddoan 
complex, but actually it was Ford’s homegrown interpolation between his 
Coles Creek and Natchez periods, displacing the “Caddoan” concept that he 
had erroneously intruded into those regions (Jeter et al. 1989:205). 

In the Lake George report, the drama was recast in terms of interactions 
between Coles Creek and Mississippian cultures, which again got headings 
and period names, while Plaquemine did not (Williams and Brain 1983:391, 
405, 408). In the big-picture discussion (Williams and Brain 1983:408!!), 
Plaquemine was only mentioned in passing in a section entitled “Ecumene 
(a.d. 1200-1400).” A discussion of the Winterville, Routh, and Anna phases 
did not mention their Plaquemine cultural affiliation (Williams and Brain 
1983:413-414). Instead, following Brain’s (1969) lead, it concentrated on “Ca- 
hokian and continuing (but unspecified) [sic] Mississippian influence” on 
Coles Creek culture. Plaquemine was mentioned only in the next few para¬ 
graphs, once with “culture” in quotes, after which it was “defined as Missis- 
sippianized Coles Creek” (Williams and Brain 1983:414). 

This report also whittled away at the time span and artifacts allotted to 
Plaquemine, by subtracting a key phase. Whereas Brain’s (i969:Table 20) 
Winterville-based dissertation and Phillips’s (1970:558-560, 945, Figure 450) 
tome had included Crippen Point as an early phase of Plaquemine culture, 
dating from a.d. 1000 to 1200, Williams and Brain (1983:373) suggested an 
extension of the Coles Creek period to include Crippen Point, with its basic 
Addis 1 set of 10 ceramic varieties as a terminal expression of Coles Creek 
culture, dating about a.d. 1100-1200. The first phase of Plaquemine culture 
became the Winterville phase, starting around a.d. 1200, featuring the Green¬ 
ville set of grog/shell-tempered types, plus the Yazoo 2 set of shell-tempered 
types (Williams and Brain i983:Figures 9.4,10.16, 11.4, and 12.1). 

So at least in the Lower Yazoo Basin, the Fordian concept of Plaquemine 
culture was gutted, even deprived of its basic Addis ware (Quimby 1951:107- 
109), which had already been subsumed under the northerly type Baytown 
Plain as var. Addis by Phillips (1970:50-51). Instead, Plaquemine was charac¬ 
terized as having primarily northerly influenced wares with shell tempering! 
However, Addis ware still appears primarily associated with the Plaquemine 
tradition farther south, on into historic Natchezan culture (Brown 1985a:- 
Table 2). 

Definitions and criteria for Addis ware have varied significantly (Jeter et al. 
1989:206; Ryan 2004:91-93). Recently, they have emphasized heterogeneous 
tempering agents, mainly crushed-sherd grog, sometimes with shell, more

rarely bone, and often dark apparently organic material, in a relatively homo¬ 
geneous paste. Aspects of form (carinated bowls, open-bowl shapes, deep jars, 
bottles) are also semidiagnostic, as are several decorated types. 

However, a new and more rigorous analysis, using quantitative standards 
derived from geology (Ryan 2004:89-100, Figures 7-1, 7-3, 7-4), suggests that 
in the southern Tensas Basin at least, the main sorting criteria for van Addis 
should be grog size (“medium-fine”) and especially grog quantity (30 percent 
or more of the paste). Thus defined, Addis did not become a major presence 
until early Plaquemine times at the Hedgeland site, whereas similar varieties 
with significantly less temper were more characteristic of late to terminal Coles 
Creek phases (Ryan 2004:91, 93, 95-96)- In Ryan’s (2004:97) analysis, the 
Greenville variety is subsumed under the Bell Plain type and also associated 
with the early Plaquemine component, though it is quite rare in that southerly 
location. 

In two LMS publications presaging the Lake George report (Belmont 
i982b:Figure 3; Belmont and Williams i98i:Table 1), the phrase “Transitional 
Coles Creek” was introduced without discussion as a subperiod between late 
Coles Creek and early Plaquemine/Mississippian or Mississippi I, dating from 
circa a.d. iioo to 1200. It included phases such as Crippen Point, Preston in 
the Tensas, Gordon in the Natchez Bluffs, and Spring Bayou in the Lower Red 
region. Another LMS report (Brown i985b:Figure 2) showed these phases 
(plus St. Gabriel in the Baton Rouge region) in the Coles Creek period but 
indicated a Plaquemine affiliation in their latter portions. In an overview, I 
emphasized a “deeply rooted continuum” in material cultures and expanded 
the phrase to “Transitional Coles Creek-Plaquemine” to underscore this 
(Jeter and Williams 1989:1651!, 172, Figure 17, 205!:'). 

LMS publications have focused on Plaquemine along the Mississippi River, 
especially east of it. Hally’s (1972) lengthy Harvard dissertation, which fo¬ 
cused on northeast Louisiana, was an exception, but it has never been pub¬ 
lished and has been downplayed, like Ford’s work, in the LMS literature. 
Meanwhile, in southeast Arkansas, which Phillips (1970:861) erroneously 
thought was basically “Caddoan” territory, other Plaquemine research was 
going on, also mostly overlooked in the LMS literature (but cf. Kidder 1991). 

Introduction to Southeast Arkansas 

This chapter is mainly about northern to northwestern Plaquemine variants, 
as seen from southeast Arkansas (Figure 9.1). The eastern boundary of my 
research territory is the Mississippi River. Along it, here and in northeast 
Louisiana, a few important sites with Plaquemine affiliations are known

but have not been assimilated into a phase. They are summarized in the next 
section. 

At a casual glance, the rest of our “delta” lowlands (generally around ioo 
to 125 feet, or 30 to 40 m asl) west of the Mississippi appear to be its flood- 
plains, but in fact they are mostly ancient, abandoned Arkansas River mean¬ 
der belts. Plaquemine culture is fairly well represented, especially on the most 
recent belt, along Bayou Bartholomew. 



OUTER LIMITS OF PLAQUEMINE CULTURE 


165 


My northern boundary is the recent to modern Lower Arkansas meander 
belt. Plaquemine culture apparently never expanded north enough to en¬ 
croach on these lowlands, but some Plaquemine influence is evident in the 
Menard locality on the north side of the river (John House, personal commu¬ 
nication, 2003). 

The western boundary is the greater Ouachita Valley, occupied by the 
Ouachita River and tributaries such as the Saline River. The Felsenthal Na¬ 
tional Wildlife Refuge bottomlands contain the lowest land and water in 
Arkansas (around and even below 65 feet, or 20 m asl). Again, there was a 
significant Plaquemine variant, with Caddoans beyond to the west and north¬ 
west. My southern boundary is the Louisiana state line. I will leave the Plaque¬ 
mine variants below there largely to my Louisiana colleagues but will poach a 
bit in that direction. 

The so-called uplands (usually 200 to 400 feet, or 60 to 120 m asl) in the 
midst of my territory are formed on West Gulf Coastal Plain and old high 
terrace deposits. They are mainly covered by timber and pastures and are 
poorly known but probably were occupied by minor offshoots of Plaquemine 
groups based to the east and west. 

Two Willey-and-Phillips-style archaeological regions, Bartholomew-Macon 
and Felsenthal, are of relevance here. The former region, named after two 
major bayous in former Arkansas meander belts, includes the delta lands west 
of the Mississippi and the eastern part of the uplands (Jeter 1982:80, Figure 
6-2). To the south, the Upper Tensas and Boeuf regions are largely in Louisiana. 

The Felsenthal region includes the western part of my territory and extends 
into poorly known localities in Louisiana (Schambach 1981:105). Farther 
south, the Ouachita Valley has not been systematically explored, although 
part of it was included in the Boeuf Basin region by Belmont (1985). No 
official region name has been designated along the Ouachita Valley proper by 
Louisiana archaeologists, but I have called it the Lower Ouachita region (Jeter 
et al. 1989:29, 211-212). Kidder (i99oa:52ff) has also used this term. 

Four relevant Willey-and-Phillips-style phases have been defined, or at least 
named, for our southeast Arkansas regions. They are the Bellaire and Bar¬ 
tholomew phases in the Bartholomew-Macon region and the Gran Marais and 
Cypress Swamp phases in the Felsenthal region. Gran Marais is the best docu¬ 
mented and Bartholomew is also fairly well known. Cypress Swamp is a prom¬ 
ising newcomer but the Bellaire phase is a dubious concept, questionable 
at best. 

A relatively well-defined sequence exists for the Tensas Basin (Hally 1972), 



1 66 


MARVIN D. JETER 


but only preliminary data have emerged for the Boeuf Basin and Lower 
Ouachita regions (Belmont 1985; Jeter et al. 1989:211-212, Table 20; Kidder 
i99oa:52ff, Figures 2-7). 

Mississippi River Sites 

The lands along the Mississippi in southeast Arkansas are very poorly known, 
since the batture between the river and levee is heavily vegetated. However, 
one site (3DE24) in this vicinity was potted by a collector in the 1960s, alleg¬ 
edly yielding a remarkable pipe that has been called a “Corn Goddess” or 
“Corn Woman” effigy (Reilly 2002, 2004:124-125). It is questionable whether 
the plants depicted actually represent corn stalks (Fritz and Kelly 2004). 

The pipe may well have been made of Missouri flint clay at or near Ca- 
hokia (Reilly 2004:131-132; cf. Emerson and Hughes 2000). Stylistically simi¬ 
lar items were made of this material during the Stirling phase (ca. a.d. iioo- 
1200) in the Cahokia vicinity and may have been exported to distant sites 
(Emerson and Girard 2004; Emerson et al. 2003), though some may have been 
interred with burials somewhat later. Alternatively, they may have been re¬ 
tained at Cahokia until after it declined and subsequently disbursed to Cad- 
doan and southeastern recipients in the mid to late 1200s (Emerson et al. 
2003:306, 308). The alleged 3DE24 find thus could be another link between 
Cahokia and this segment of the LMV during the transitional subperiod or 
slightly later during early Plaquemine times. A few other finds from this vi¬ 
cinity, including a stone “kneeling prisoner” pipe, also may point in this di¬ 
rection (notes and photos on file at the Arkansas Archeological Surveys Uni¬ 
versity of Arkansas at Monticello Research Station). 

Near the southeast corner of Arkansas is the Lakeport mound site, in a 
bend of the Mississippi. It has 11 mounds, five arranged around an apparent 
plaza. One is about 10 m high and roughly rectangular. Only brief tests have 
been done here. No major midden was found, suggesting a possible vacant 
ceremonial center. The sparse artifact sample suggests late or transitional 
Coles Creek, Plaquemine, and late Mississippian occupations, with the latter 
perhaps representing the major component (Rolingson 1971b). 

Some 50 km to the south, on a Mississippi oxbow in northeast Louisiana, 
recent work at the Lake Providence Mounds suggests occupation during the 
Coles Creek to Plaquemine transition, around a.d. 1150-1250. Exotic items 
suggest northern contacts, including the American Bottom and Cahokia 
(Wells and Weinstein, this volume). 

North of Lake Providence at Panola, Louisiana, a low mound was bull¬ 
dozed in 1965, revealing burials. A collector uncovered at least 24 skeletons,

mainly extended-supine but also including four bundle burials. The collector 
also recovered more than 60 vessels of which 44 were retained. These finds 
were summarized by a leading amateur (Jones 1984), who was advised by John 
Belmont of the LMS. They appear to represent terminal Coles Creek to 
Plaquemine use or uses of the mound, with a few hints of a very late Missis- 
sippian presence (Jones i984:i42ff, Figures 1-5). 

These sites, along with Winterville, suggest that along the Mississippi it¬ 
self the Plaquemine situation was more elaborate, with more connections to 
northerly Mississippian cultures than along the old Arkansas River meander 
belts in the southeast Arkansas interior. Plowever, more intensive surveys and 
excavations would be required to document the settlement-subsistence system 
along the Mississippi. 

Deconstructing the “Bellaire Phase” Pipe Dream 

Bellaire, the first designated but least documented phase under scrutiny here, 
was named as a “particularly tentative” concept by Phillips (1970:944-945), 
largely to create a cultural home for a remarkable serpent-cat stone pipe (Fig¬ 
ure 9.2). This pipe was found in 1886, either by a farmhand plowing or during 
a dig into a mound on Crooked Bayou in northernmost Chicot County. In 
1931 it was purchased by Judge Harry J. Lemley of Hope, Arkansas. His col¬ 
lections were later acquired by the Gilcrease Museum of Tulsa, Oklahoma. 
Phillips regarded Bellaire as related to coeval phases of Plaquemine culture, 
but there are a number of problems with this. 

Lemley also sponsored a 1934 expedition to southeast Arkansas. At Bellaire, 
a “badly damaged” mound, “approximately 8c/ in diameter and 12' high,” in 
the specified location was briefly tested, producing only a few sherds of “Tunica 
ware” (late shell-tempered) pottery (Lemley and Dickinson 1937:31). The 
mound remnant was revisited in 1971 and found to be only about a foot high 
and 6 to 10 feet across, reportedly having been plowed down gradually. Noth¬ 
ing was found on or near the mound, and the site has not been revisited by 
professionals. 

The Bellaire pipe very closely resembles one reportedly found at Mound- 
ville, Alabama, around i860 (Moore 1905:131, Figures 1-3), now in the Pea¬ 
body Museum at Harvard (a replica is lent to the LMS s C. B. Moore Award 
winner each year). A very similar specimen was excavated at Moundville by 
Moore himself (see below). Another was reportedly found at Lake George 
around 1900 (Williams and Brain 1983:255, Figure 7.32a—c). Several similar 
pipes depicting mythical animals or humans are known, including those from 
the Selsertown or Emerald Mounds site just north of Natchez and one report-

edly found at or near Hot Springs, Arkansas (Brown 1926:256-264, Figures 
218-226). 

The Bellaire pipe was originally described as made of felsite, an igneous 
rock (Lemley and Dickinson 1937:31). However, Vincas Steponaitis, who has 
studied similar pipes from Moundville and other sites, states they were all 
made of Glendon limestone, best known from outcrops in the vicinity of 
Vicksburg (Steponaitis, personal communication, 2004). He states that Mound¬ 
ville burials in general date between a.d. 1200 and 1500 and those with more 
elaborate or exotic artifacts tend to date between a.d. 1300 and 1450. Moore’s 
(1905:237-240, Figures 165-171) own find was in a burial with a remarkable 
stone effigy bowl and several unillustrated items. Steponaitis suggests that 
these materials date in the a.d. 1400—1450 range. A similar specimen from 
Emerald probably dates to the Foster-Emerald phase transition, circa a.d. 1450 
to the early 1500s, still within the Plaquemine tradition in that region. 


OUTER LIMITS OF PLAQUEMINE CULTURE 1 69 

These comparisons cast doubt on the association of the Bellaire pipe with 
Plaquemine culture in southeast Arkansas. Here, a transition to Mississippian 
culture seems to have occurred by about a.d. 1400 (Jackson 1992; Jeter et al. 
i989:i7iff; Rolingson 1976,1993). It may have been made by Plaquemine peo¬ 
ple near Vicksburg and traded to Mississippians at Bellaire, where the 1930s 
test produced only shell-tempered pottery. 

Phillips (1970:944-945) did not discuss other artifacts of the Bellaire phase, 
but merely compared it to his Crippen Point, Mayersville, and Fitzhugh 
phases, that is, Plaquemine culture as he saw it or transitional Coles Creek in 
the revised LMS scheme. Major ceramic types of those phases were listed by 
Phillips (1970:558, 945), but so far there is very little evidence for any of them 
from the Bellaire locality. Alba Stemmed arrow point varieties, rare Bayou 
Goula “fishtail” points, and bone and antler points have been reported for the 
Crippen Point and Mayersville phases (Brain 1989:105; Williams and Brain 
1983:336, 338). Of these, only Alba-like points are known from southeast Ar¬ 
kansas. The Bellaire locality is a blank with regard to well-provenienced 
points. 

Phillips (1970:944) named four other southeast Arkansas sites as having 
Bellaire components. Almost no further fieldwork or analysis has been done, 
but in the light of present knowledge only one of them, Alma Brown, appears 
to approach even minimal evidence of a Plaquemine component. It once had 
at least six mounds, of uncertain dates (Lemley and Dickinson i937:37ff)- It 
was revisited by the LMS (Phillips et al. i95i:Table 1) and was discussed by 
Phillips (1970:892-893, 916), who remarked that it “has everything from the 
Marksville period on,” which might imply a Plaquemine component. The 
LMS Archives (Steponaitis et al. 2002, site files: 17-K-7) indicate that over 
3,800 sherds were collected in 1940. A few are of types that might have come 
from a Plaquemine component but are not diagnostic. 

In summary, the entire Bellaire phase of Plaquemine culture might well be 
taxonomically sunk unless definitive evidence of Plaquemine occupation can 
be found in this locality. Relevant components at some of its putative sites 
might instead be included in a Bellaire phase of late Mississippian culture 
or lumped into the late prehistoric to protohistoric Mississippian Hog Lake 
phase. 

The Bartholomew Phase 

To the west in the same region, Rolingson (1976) defined the Bartholomew 
phase of Plaquemine culture on the basis of extensive surveys and tests along 
and near Bayou Bartholomew. Well ahead of the LMS revision, she suggested 
an overall chronology of about a.d. 1200-1400 (Rolingson 1976:117-119).

However, the artifact assemblage included some items that probably belong to 
the transitional subperiod of about a.d. 1100 - 1200 . 

Ceramics 

The ceramics included mainly Addis -like Baytown Plain with some shell- 
tempered Mississippi Plain and rare bone-tempered ware (Morris Plain), 
which hints at Caddoan influence. Relatively scarce decorated sherds included 
varieties of Mazique Incised and, more rarely, Harrison Bayou Incised as rim 
decorations. Evansville Punctated is apparently almost diagnostic of this pe¬ 
riod in these regions. Also present were a HardyA\kc variety of Coles Creek In¬ 
cised, Plaquemine Brushed, Avoyelles Punctated, Hollyknowe Ridge-Pinched, 
L’Eau Noire Incised, and early varieties of shell-tempered Winterville Incised 
(Rolingson 1976:115-116, 1993). A finer-grained sequence of these types, or 
varieties of them, might be developed to subdivide this phase (see the Gran 
Marais-Cypress Swamp section). 

Ashley versus Homan Points 

Rolingson (1971a; cf. Rolingson 1976, 1993) defined the Ashley arrow point 
type, distinguished mainly by its rounded, “bulbous” stem, as common on 
Bartholomew sites. Subsequently, she also recognized this type in the Felsen- 
thal region (Rolingson 1981:73(0. However, her illustrations included points 
that converge with the somewhat similar Homan type. Although individual 
specimens no doubt intergrade, Ashley points may tend to be later and more 
closely associated with northern Plaquemine culture. 

The Homan type was defined by Wood (1963), who noted that corner 
notching produced “a flared, fan-shaped stem,” which often has distinct cor¬ 
ners where its edges meet the “evenly convex” base. He suggested a Coles 
Creek cultural affiliation but gave an estimated date range of a.d. 1000-1300, 
which might extend them too late. According to Brown (1976:79, 92), a more 
widely published Homan description (Perino 1968:34, Plate 17) confused the 
situation by including illustrations of Ashley-like points with more bulbous, 
rounded stems. Similar overlaps are present in Rolingson’s (1971a, 1981) and 
Webb’s (2000:16) illustrations of Ashley and Homan points. In one report, 
Rolingson (1981:73-75) included as Ashley points some specimens in which 
“the stem is more fan-shaped than is typical of the type.” 

Others have not been consistent with regard to criteria for these types (cf. 
illustrations in Weinstein and Kelley 1984). Weber (1973:34-36) sorted them 
mainly by presence or absence of shoulder barbs. Her other criteria were 
shared among types and she did not emphasize stem shape. Waddell and King 



OUTER LIMITS OF PLAQUEMINE CULTURE 


171 

(1990:64), citing “vague or overlapping sorting criteria” and using an un¬ 
wieldy computerized database, simply lumped the Ashley, Alba, and Homan 
types as an “ASALHO cluster.” 

In contrast, I prefer a strict, literal emphasis on the rounded, bulbous stem 
of the Ashley type versus the fan-shaped basal-cornered stem of the Homan 
type, with an “in-between” or “Homan-Ashley” category for specimens with 
ambiguous stems. Homan points discussed and illustrated by Hemmings 
(1982:229, Figure 58n, o, Table 20) appear to meet these criteria. Hemmings 
suggested that Ashley points may have been derived from Homan points, per¬ 
haps overlapping from circa a.d. 1000 to 1200. 

There is evidence for earlier occurrences of Homan points than Ashley 
points, strictly speaking. At Toltec, Hoffman (1998:68-70) defined a broad 
“Rockwall cluster” of arrow points, including two specimens that “generally 
fit within the Homan type” (Hoffman 1998:69, Figure 720, p) and meet my 
preferred criteria. This suggests that they were in use as early as a.d. 950-1050, 
if not earlier (Rolingson 1998:100, 107). Webb (2000:16) estimated the time 
range of Homan points at a.d. 800-900 but also said that they were found 
with late Coles Creek ceramics, implying a somewhat later date range. Al¬ 
though her typology may be questionable, Weber (1973:61-65, 73) found 
Homan-like points in strata that she considered early to late Coles Creek and 
Plaquemine. She found Ashley-like points only in the late Coles Creek and 
Plaquemine strata. She also stated that most arrow points of all types from 
Plaquemine deposits were found in their lower levels, hinting at their later 
replacement by bone or antler points, as in the Plaquemine heartland (Hally 
1972:335). But there is at least some evidence that Ashley points may still have 
been in use after a.d. 1400 (Hemmings 1982:191—193). 

Sites and Settlement Data 

Rolingson’s (1976) Bartholomew phase data were from 51 sites divided into 
four types: 6 small ceremonial centers, 14 hamlets, 29 house sites, and only 2 
camp sites. The centers were spaced about 3 to 11 km (ca. 2 to 7 miles) apart 
along Bayou Bartholomew and nearby streams. They were relatively small, 
despite the flurry of major mound building that was going on to the south 
and east just before, and especially after, a.d. 1200. They had only one or two 
mounds, with no evidence of plazas. The largest mounds were probably flat 
topped but only medium sized at best. Midden deposits, sometimes extending 
more than 100 m along low natural-levee rises, were generally nearby. Lacking 
extensive excavations, it is unknown whether these represent contemporary 
houses or palimpsests of separate occupations involving only one or a few 



!72 


MARVIN D. JETER 


houses at any time, and the same uncertainty applies to the hamlets. Nor is it 
known whether occupations were seasonal or year-round. The hamlets are 
generally small, with no evidence for nucleated (let alone fortified) villages 
with numerous structures as in coeval Mississippian sites to the north (cf. 
Morse and Morse i983:237ff). 

Five sites with Bartholomew phase components were tested (Rolingson 
1993). The Henderson site, the southernmost center, had one mound about 
4 m high with a base ca. 40 by 40 m and occupation zones extending about 
60 m east and 90 m west of it (Rolingson i993:45ff). Reportedly there was 
once also a low mound about 60 m away. 

The McArthur site, a small hamlet or house site, produced post molds from 
two overlapping circular structures of individual-post construction (Roling¬ 
son i993:6iff, Figure 29). Ceramics were dominated by the usual types, with 
no diagnostics of other periods. Lithics included eight Ashley-like or Homan- 
like points (cf. Rolingson i993:Figure 34a). Seven burial pits contained at least 
eight individuals. Importantly, they were analyzed and found to represent 
three partially disabled adults plus five infants, suggesting that perhaps “only 
peripheral members [of this society] were accorded habitation site burial” 
(Rose and Powell 1993:71). The adult burials were extended, two with heads 
to the south. One was buried with a Baytown Plain jar and a turtle-carapace 
cup. One infant had a Mississippi Plain carinated bowl and another a Mazique 
Incised rim sherd. 

The Currie site (Rolingson i993:85fif), a low midden mound about 12 m 
across on a low rise in a swampy zone, was occupied during several periods. 
Mixed components made analysis difficult. The Ellis Pugh site (Rolingson 
1993:1151! ) was similarly multicomponent and disturbed by deep plowing. The 
Wilson Brake site (Rolingson i993:2yff) had only a minor Bartholomew com¬ 
ponent in the plow zone. 

Subsequent Bartholomew Phase Research 

Salvage of Mound A at Boydell, Rolingson’s northernmost Bartholomew 
phase site, revealed a middle Coles Creek period Stage I, a middle to late Coles 
Creek Stage II, a late Coles Creek to Plaquemine Stage III, and hints of later 
stages disturbed by earth-moving equipment (House and Jeter 1994:73-77). 
Eight disturbed burials in the upper mound contained the remains of at least 
15 individuals with basically Plaquemine ceramics, including Addis Plain va¬ 
rieties, Coleman Incised, L’Eau Noire Incised, and Mississippi Plain. A smashed 
Beldeau Incised vessel may have come from a slightly earlier burial (House 
and Jeter i994:22f, 26ff). 

One large, nicely made plain open bowl from a Boydell burial is made of

Figure 9.3. Addis Plain bowl with deeply notched rim from the Boydell site in southeast Arkansas. 
Diameter of rim exterior, about 40 cm. 


grog-tempered Addis ware with possible bone or shell inclusions (Figure 9.3). 
It has a deeply notched rim reminiscent of the edges of circular sandstone 
palettes used for grinding pigments at Moundville (Moore i9C>5:Figures 4, 5, 
19, 65-66; Whitney et al. 2002). Fragments of similar palettes have also been 
found at Lake George (Williams and Brain 1983:263-266, Figure 7.41). Ste- 
ponaitis (personal communication, 2004) states that similar bowls of the 
Anna Interior Engraved (or Incised) type from the Natchez vicinity may also 
have held pigments. 

An intensive catchment survey on relatively high ground within a 2-km 
radius of Boydell found seven small hamlet or household sites with probable 
Bartholomew components, as well as possibly four others (Jeter et al. 2007). 
Artifacts included most of the usually expected ceramics. Ashley points were 
fairly common, especially at two moderate-sized household sites. Because of 
access problems, the total intensively surveyed area was only about 8.5 km 2 . 
Rolingson’s (i993:Figure 5) map shows about 350 km 2 of relatively high land 
in her project area, by my estimate, so there might easily be 250 to 300 Bar¬ 
tholomew phase sites on the higher land in her area. Additional sites of this 
phase, like Currie, undoubtedly exist on the lower flood-prone lands. Still 
more surely exist beyond her area’s confines. 

Bartholomew-like Sites to the North 

In a preliminary paper, Rolingson (1970) noted the lack of mounds for about 
50 km (ca. 30 miles) above Boydell, after which other mounds were associated 
with “quite different” cultural materials. We now refer to this as the Tillar 
complex or phase of late to protohistoric Mississippian culture (Jackson 1992; 



174 


MARVIN D. JETER 


Jeter 1986; McKelway 1990), but we also know now that there are Plaquemine¬ 
like components in that locality. 

About halfway between Boydell and Tillar, my surface surveys found sev¬ 
eral small sites with varying proportions of grog- and shell-tempered ceram¬ 
ics, possibly representing various episodes during a Plaquemine-Mississippian 
transition, rather than overlapping separate occupations. One site produced a 
Mill Creek (southern Illinois) chert hoe chip with high polish on one surface. 

Just north on the bayou, intensive salvage at the Abies Creek site recovered 
predominantly Tillar burials and ceramics but also a few sherds from an 
ephemeral Plaquemine component (Jackson 1992:86). At nearby Harrell Bend 
on the bayou, a small-scale salvage effort produced mostly shell-tempered 
sherds but also several late Coles Creek to Plaquemine types, plus an Ashley- 
like point (Wesolowsky 1974:20-31). 

At the Taylor site, on the bayou in northeastern Drew County, there were 
once four mounds around a plaza. Testing of two of them revealed early Coles 
Creek construction starts in both (Jeter, ed. 2007; Jeter et al. 1991). Only one, 
Mound 3, had a substantial above-ground remnant. Its flat-topped Stage III 
surface was occupied during late or transitional Coles Creek times, with an 
archaeomagnetic date of “late 1100s” (Dan Wolfman, personal communica¬ 
tion, 1993) associated with Yicksburg-like ware, Caddoan Holly Fine En¬ 
graved sherds, flakes of probable Crescent Quarry (near St. Louis) chert (John 
Kelly and Neal Lopinot, personal communications, 2001), and one flake of 
Mill Creek chert, plus an arc of post molds from a circular structure and 
a smudge pit containing a number of charred corncobs. The flat Stage IV 
burned surface produced an early 1200s Plaquemine period date (Wolfman, 
personal communication, 1993). Stage V had lost its upper surface but yielded 
some later materials. Another Taylor mound was allegedly the source of a pipe 
fragment that has been identified as being of Missouri flint clay (Bruce Smith, 
personal communication, 1982). 

My limited surveys farther up Bayou Bartholomew found additional 
Plaquemine-like sites into central Lincoln County, as did a contract project 
(Giardino 1979:126). A few generally small mounds are known up to this vi¬ 
cinity, but they have not been excavated under control. Surface collections 
from the Yorktown Mound, on the bayou north of Star City, consist mainly 
of Coles Creek ceramics but include a transitional variety of Coles Creek In¬ 
cised and an Evansville Punctated rim. 

The "Louisiana Bartholomew” Locality 

Probably related are sites along Bayou Bartholomew in northeast Louisiana, 
including the Matheny mound group (Kidder 19903:67,1994). It was mapped 



OUTER LIMITS OF PLAQUEMINE CULTURE 


175 


in 1880 as including three mounds in a nearly linear configuration, but only 
two were visible by the early 1900s (Kidder 1994:138-139, Figures 2 and 3). 

Matheny Mound A is about 7 m high and over 40 by 40 m at the base, 
with a flat top ca. 15 by 15 m. Construction started, as at Taylor, early in the 
Coles Creek period over a Baytown midden. Second and possibly third stages 
may have been added during a Plaquemine occupation, and the fourth and 
final stage represented a Mississippian component (Kidder 1994:144-145). 
Mound B was lower and severely damaged. It apparently had a similar origin 
and “abundant Plaquemine remains” on its plowed surface, along with a few 
Mississippian sherds (Kidder 1994:146). 

Overall, Kidder (1994:149) stated, “the Plaquemine culture is better repre¬ 
sented than any other component” despite the lack of undisturbed deposits, 
and he added that C. B. Moore had excavated a Plaquemine cemetery west 
of the mounds. Moore (1909:166-169) reported 13 adult burials, in extended- 
supine position with varied orientations, plus two layers of massed bones, a 
bundle burial, and several isolated skulls, with a total of 14 ceramic vessels. 
Only one vessel was obviously shell tempered. 

Subsistence, Agriculture, and Maize 

Subsistence data are scarce for this phase, because of lack of intensive excava¬ 
tions and flotation. At the McArthur site, seven irregular pits or midden rem¬ 
nants produced the remains of deer and other mammals, turkey, turtles, and 
fish, plus some shellfish and nut hulls (Rolingson 1993:80-82, Table 26). Rol- 
ingson’s (1993:42,106-112,130, Tables 20, 29, 31) other Bartholomew sites pro¬ 
duced some similar faunal remains and a few nut hulls, but interpretations 
were limited by disturbance and poor preservation. 

Although Williams and Brain (1983:408) suggested that Coles Creek cul¬ 
ture was based on maize agriculture, subsequent research has not borne this 
out. Instead, it now appears that wild plant and animal foods, plus the Native 
Eastern domesticates, were the basis. Maize was present by the eighth century 
a.d. but apparently not important until the 1200s or later in these latitudes 
(cf. Lopinot 2003). Our late-twelfth century a.d. maize at Taylor is thus not 
surprising and is consistent with recent findings elsewhere. 

Maize has been found at Toltec in small amounts in a probable feasting 
context as early as the late-eighth century a.d. and less abundantly in a feature 
assemblage dominated by Native Eastern cultigens, along with some wild 
plant remains dating from circa a.d. 925 to 1025. Maize was present at related 
sites by a.d. 700-900 northwest of Little Rock and between a.d. 960 and 
1005 closer to Toltec (Rolingson 1998:105-106, 2003:23, 29; C. Smith 1996). 
Overall, the context was one of “considerable reliance on, and experimenta- 



176 


MARVIN D. JETER 


tion with, cultivated crops in the 750-950 period” (Rolingson 2003:23). Maize 
of the Eastern complex, which apparently evolved in the Midwest rather 
than in Mesoamerica, has been identified at the Caddoan George C. Davis 
site (Ford 1997:107), possibly as early as the late-ninth century a.d. (Story 
1997:96). Maize has also been found in a pre-Caddoan context, more defi¬ 
nitely in the 800s, at the Ray site in the Red River valley (Bruseth 1998:53). 

Over 3,000 fragments of maize were found at Lake Providence in northeast 
Louisiana in contexts dating circa a.d. 1150-1250. It was present in about 75 
percent of some 140 sampled features and 80 midden samples (Roberts 2005; 
Weinstein 2005; Wells and Weinstein, this volume). Farther south in the Ten¬ 
sas, maize became more common between a.d. 1000 and 1200, a trend that 
accelerated after a.d. 1200 but may not have reached the intensification stage 
until the 1300s (Fritz and Kidder 1993:8, 9-11). 

In the southern Tensas Basin, work at the Lledgeland site has indicated that 
“both wild and domesticated native seed crops. . . were heavily utilized in the 
early Coles Creek period. . . . Maize occurs in minor amounts beginning in 
the late Coles Creek period, but does not play a major role in subsistence until 
the Plaquemine occupation” (Ryan 2004: iii; see also Roberts 2004:217-219, 
224-226). This calls into question Kidder and Fritzs (1993) hypothesis of a 
nonagricultural food base for early Coles Creek heartland populations. In¬ 
stead, at Lledgeland, “a substantial degree of native seed cropping was under¬ 
way” as early as the late-eighth century a.d. (Roberts 2004:225). 

These findings reinforce part of Rolingson’s (1976:119) suggestion that Bar¬ 
tholomew subsistence “was based on corn-beans horticulture supplemented 
by wild resources including deer, various nuts, and other bottom-land flora.” 
However, no domesticated beans have been identified in these regions. In¬ 
deed, they are absent from Cahokia’s peak period and apparently were not 
significant in the eastern United States until after a.d. 1250 or 1300 (Hart et 
al. 2002; Hart and Scarry 1999). In their absence, acorns may have provided 
an adequate nutritional supplement to maize (Ford 1997:104-105). 

The Gran Marais and Cypress Swamp Phases 

Schambach (1979:30, Figure 3.1) defined the Gran Marais phase as represent¬ 
ing Plaquemine culture in the Felsenthal region. However, he soon changed 
its cultural affiliation to unknown due to proximity to Caddoan cultures and 
estimated its date at circa a.d. 1250-1350 (Schambach and Rolingson 1981:189- 
190, Table 18). Later, with more evidence in hand, he cautiously called it “a 
northern regional variant of the Plaquemine culture, although that concept is 
still so nebulous that close comparison is impossible” (Schambach 1990:122, 



OUTER LIMITS OF PLAQUEMINE CULTURE 


177 


Figure 78). From my perspective, I have leaned toward the Plaquemine desig¬ 
nation for this phase (Jeter et al. 1989:210; Jeter and Early 1999:52-55). It 
might be seen as essentially continuous with the Bartholomew phase, if not 
for the poorly known intervening uplands. 

In contrast to Rolingson’s sequence, which placed Bartholomew continu¬ 
ously between Coles Creek and Mississippian phases, the finer-tuned Felsen- 
thal sequence includes some gaps. At Bangs Slough, one component was made 
the basis of a new Cypress Swamp phase of the “Late Coles Creek-Early Mis¬ 
sissippi period,” estimated at about a.d. 950-1050 on the basis of ceramics and 
11 radiocarbon dates (Schambach 1990:116-118, Table 32). On one chart it was 
directly aligned with a Plaquemine cultural affiliation but also with a date of 
a.d. 1000 (Schambach i99o:Figure 78). The text stated it was “clearly ances¬ 
tral” to the Gran Marais phase and compared it to “Coles Creek and Plaque¬ 
mine adaptations to the east and south” (Schambach 1990:120-121). Gran 
Marais itself was again restricted to circa a.d. 1250-1350 and the protohistoric 
Mississippian Caney Bayou phase was placed around a.d. 1550-1700, leaving 
two-century gaps before and after the Gran Marais phase (Schambach 1990: 
121-122). 

However, this chronology itself is actually about 20 years old and may need 
revision. It used the Phillips (1970) period terminology and chronology, prob¬ 
ably because the Bangs Slough contract report had been prepared before the 
Lake George revisions were available (Schambach 1985), and the published 
report closely followed the contract report’s format. Kidder (1991:81-83) re¬ 
marked that Bangs Slough provided “the strongest, most consistent set of 
[radiocarbon] dates in the central and southern Lower Mississippi Valley.” He 
added that “the Felsenthal sequence is in many ways more secure than that 
originally defined” in the LMV to the east, but he also noted that the calen- 
drical dates needed calibration. Recent recalibrations for this time range have 
suggested that calendrical equivalents should be moved up to 50-100 years 
later (Knight 2003:135), so the Cypress Swamp phase might actually date circa 
a.d. 1000-1200. 

Artifacts 

This section will be dominated by discussions of ceramics, but I will note that 
Ashley points are fairly common. Some Homan and Alba-like points also may 
be associated, as discussed above (Hemmings 1982:229, Figure 58; Rolingson 
1981:73-75, 97, Figure 15; Waddell and King 1990:64, Figure 52). 

The Gran Marais phase is characterized mainly by, once again, Baytown/ 
Addis grog-tempered plainwares. The decorated ceramics, influenced by Cad- 



178 


MARVIN D. JETER 


doan practices, have such complex combinations of rim and body decorations, 
at times involving different decorative techniques on the two fields, that the 
rim-oriented Phillips type-variety system proved inadequate. Schambach (1981) 
consequently devised his innovative “descriptive” classification system. Some 
level or levels in its hierarchy of categories can be applied to virtually all deco¬ 
rated sherds, whereas their classification is often ambiguous for previously 
established types of the LMV or TMS. 

Nevertheless, the Felsenthal region is considered part of the LMV (Scham¬ 
bach 1981:103-104) and useful if tentative comparisons can be made to some 
familiar LMV types and varieties. These include Mazique Incised and a re¬ 
gional variant, Lapile Incised (Schambach 1981:166); Harrison Bayou Incised 
(a panregional type, fairly common in the LMV, but, as noted by Ford 
1936:96, Figures 1 and 2, Harrison Bayou itself is actually in northeast Texas!); 
Coleman-like Pargoud Incised (Schambach 1981:167); punctated or pinched 
variants (as in Avoyelles Punctated, Evansville Punctated, and Hollyknowe 
Ridge-Pinched or Caddoan types); and, more rarely, Plaquemine Brushed (or 
Caddoan brushed types). Also present are variants of Kiam Incised, a panre¬ 
gional type first described in the Caddoan literature (Suhm and Jelks 1962:89), 
with some resemblance to Coles Creek Incised, var. Hardy, often with diago¬ 
nal overincising. 

Introducing his descriptive system, Schambach (1981:106) specified that it 
was designed for the “clay-tempered [i.e., grog-tempered] Mississippi period 
decorated pottery” of the Felsenthal region (emphasis added). Subsequently, 
its coverage has been expanded spatially, temporally, and culturally, taking in 
later shell-(and grog-) tempered Caddoan pottery (Schambach and Miller 
1984:1121!) and earlier grog-tempered ceramics (Schambach and Waddell 
1990:54-58, Table 3; Schambach 1990:113!!). 

The Cypress Swamp and Gran Marais assemblages shared Baytown Plain, 
Harrison Bayou Incised, and Kiam Incised, on the type level (Schambach 
1990:116, 121). Brushed pottery was also present in both, but Plaquemine 
Brushed was not included in the lists because it was not sortable from Cad¬ 
doan brushed types (Schambach 1990:57, 61). Notably, only Cypress Swamp 
had Coles Creek Incised varieties, Evansville Punctated, and Hollyknowe 
Ridge-Pinched. Conversely, only Gran Marais had Avoyelles Punctated, Lapile 
Incised, and Pargoud Incised. Actually, this overall Gran Marais type list rep¬ 
resents the Shallow Lake site assemblage. At Bangs Slough, where the Gran 
Marais component was estimated as perhaps “50 years later than the Shallow 
Lake assemblage,” Harrison Bayou Incised was absent, apparently “replaced 
by Mazique Incised.” That would imply a late, Manchac -like variety of the 



OUTER LIMITS OF PLAQUEMINE CULTURE 


179 


Mazique type, which was represented by a Mazique -like variety in the Cypress 
Swamp assemblage (Schambach 1990:55, 62). 

Sites and Settlement Data in the Felsenthal Heartland 

An intensive bankline survey by Hemmings (1982) along the Ouachita and 
lower Saline rivers, in the heart of the Felsenthal region, found a number of 
Gran Marais components, representing temporary extractive camps in this 
flood-prone environment. Beyond the banklines, Hemmings called attention 
to seven Gran Marais mound centers, which apparently also served as mul- 
tiseasonal, if not permanent, base settlements, on or near the overlooking ter¬ 
race edges or on “pine island” ridges within the flood zone (Hemmings 1982: 
151-153, Figure 34). One center, Watts Field in Union County, has at least nine 
mounds, including two rectangular flat-topped mounds at the ends of a long 
plaza, and several adjacent midden zones (House 1982:69-71, Figure 14). 

Another Union County center, Shallow Lake, had at least five small mounds 
and one plaza, plus several dispersed midden zones (Rolingson and Scham¬ 
bach 1981:7-10, Figure 3). One mound produced Gran Marais materials asso¬ 
ciated with a circular structure, about 12 m in diameter, with widely spaced 
post molds (Rolingson and Schambach 1981:37-40, Figure 38) and a number 
of pit features. Radiocarbon and archaeomagnetic analyses suggested a date 
range of a.d. 1250-1300 (Rolingson and Schambach 1981:52-53). 

The Eagle Lake center, on a terrace edge in southern Bradley County above 
the Saline-Ouachita juncture, has four mounds, one of them fairly large, 
around an elongated plaza, in addition to two late prehistoric habitation 
zones. Surface collections, plus tests atop a medium-sized mound and well 
into (and below) the smallest one, suggest late Coles Creek to Plaquemine 
components, with no evidence yet of Mississippian occupation (Jeter 2007a). 

The Saline Valley and Other Tributaries 

In the bankline zone near the mouth of the Saline River, Hemmings (1982:1681!, 
255-263, Figures 68-69, Tables 23-25 and A-3) surface collected and briefly 
tested the False Indigo site, finding a small but dense concentration and scat¬ 
ter of over 1,000 sherds. Also present were two Ashley points and an Alba 
point, along with midden or pit remnants, all consistent with a briefly occu¬ 
pied, early Gran Marais phase extractive camp interpretation. 

A short distance upstream, at Jug Point Cutoff, Hemmings (1982:185-187) 
tested a small, compact midden lens associated with a later Gran Marais ce¬ 
ramic assemblage and an Ashley point (Hemmings i982:Tables 25 and A-3). 
Again, a brief seasonal extractive function was likely. Nearby at the Jug Point

2 site, he found a probable early Caney Bayou extractive camp, with nearly 75 
percent shell-tempered pottery and probably dating after a.d. 1400 (Hem- 
mings 1982:191-193; Tables 25 and A-3). It is mentioned here because its sur¬ 
face produced two Ashley points, hinting at a late survival of this type. 

In northwest Ashley County, the Gordon site (not the Gordon site near 
Natchez) was intensively excavated by amateurs (White 1987). It yielded evi¬ 
dence of Coles Creek occupations, plus a fairly substantial Gran Marais ce¬ 
ramic assemblage (White i987:Table 1) and a protohistoric Mississippian 
cemetery. Particularly noteworthy were several rim-body sherds referred to as 
“Gordon Brushed-Incised” (White 1987:9, 18, Figure 11). The “brushing” ac¬ 
tually is sloppily executed incising, using the criteria of Schambach (1981:144). 
In the less common variant, overincised diagonal lines are often present, and 
the body is often fingernail-punctated or sometimes plain. In the more com¬ 
mon variant, overincising seems to be absent, and the body is always plain. I 
regard both as varieties of Kiam Incised. 

Similar materials were found in more limited amateur investigations at the 
Gary site (3AS247) on the Saline about 5 km above Gordon (Scott 2007), at 
Gee’s Landing on the river in southwestern Drew County (White 1970:14, 
Figure 15), and at the Fraser site on a low terrace just east of Warren (White 
1987:18, 32). A newly discovered small mound site, a few miles to the north, 
also appears to have had one or more Coles Creek-Plaquemine occupations. 

Brief salvage excavations at the Saline-Fifteen site, on the upland edge over¬ 
looking the Saline Valley in northeast Bradley County, produced evidence of 
transitional, late Gran Marais to Caney Bayou occupation. Four separate test 
units found arbitrarily defined lower midden deposits with about 50-percent 
shell-tempered pottery below an upper midden with about 70-percent shell- 
tempered ware (Jeter 2007b). Still farther north, occasional finds in the 
largely wooded or pastured landscapes suggest that Plaquemine occupations 
of small sites continued into Cleveland and western Lincoln counties (Jeter 
and Early 1999:52-55). A small site in northeast Cleveland County is our 
northernmost Plaquemine candidate. 

Between the Saline and Ouachita rivers, the situation along smaller streams 
such as L’Aigle and Moro creeks is not at all clear, because of lack of fieldwork. 
Only minimal information is available for the Felsenthal region between 
Moro Creek and the Ouachita Valley. An extensive survey in the central Cal¬ 
houn County uplands located 49 small sites, 12 of which produced a total of 
only 121 sherds, more than half of them from one site. Five sites yielded evi¬ 
dence of one or more Mississippi period occupations, but some may represent 
the Caney Bayou phase rather than Plaquemine culture (House 1986).

Upstream in the Ouachita Valley 

Weinstein and Kelley (1984) extensively surveyed bankline levees and natural 
rises in the Ouachita Valley from Calion to Camden, with testing of selected 
sites and a regional reconnaissance. They suggested that the maximum north¬ 
westward extent of any LMV culture had occurred during Plaquemine times, 
almost reaching the Camden vicinity, with Caddoan culture beyond in the 
Middle Ouachita region of the TMS. Going up valley, their first tested site 
with a significant Gran Marais component was Bangs Slough (Weinstein and 
Kelley 1984:337-375). It was later tested more extensively by the Survey, result¬ 
ing in a major report (Schambach 1985, 1990). 

At Little Mud Lake, a short distance up the valley, testing produced evi¬ 
dence of Archaic, transitional Coles Creek, Gran Marais, and Caney Bayou 
occupations (Weinstein and Kelley 1984:382-414). A slightly disturbed burial 
included the remains of a large adult male, placed in extended-supine position 
with the head to the east, fragmentary bones of an infant, and a few inter¬ 
mixed bones of a newborn (Weinstein and Kelley 1984:403-412, Figures 7-44 
through 7-46). Near the adult was a ceramic elbow pipe, tempered with grog, 
finely crushed shell, and bone, with a barred oval design (a “Southern Cult” 
motif) on its front and L-shaped variants on its sides (Weinstein and Kelley 
1984:403, Figure 7-43A). The fill contained early Gran Marais ceramics, along 
with an Alba-like point. A sample from the adults ribs produced a radiocar¬ 
bon date centered on the early a.d. 1200s (Weinstein and Kelley 1984:412, 
Table 7-47). An associated pit contained another grog-tempered pipe, with 
some attributes of both Caddoan and LMV pipes (Weinstein and Kelley 
1984:406, Figure 7-43B). The skeletal remains were thoroughly analyzed. The 
adult had pronounced occipital flattening, plus evidence of multiple episodes 
of metabolic upset between the ages of 1.5 and 6.5 years (Mires and Owsley 
1984). 

A short distance upstream, Boone’s Mounds was tested by C. B. Moore 
(1909:90-91) “without success.” Even then, the main mound had been par¬ 
tially eroded by the river (Moore i909:Figure 91). Subsequent relic-collectors’ 
efforts were more productive. The Survey’s Southern Arkansas University Re¬ 
search Station has photographed a number of their artifacts, sketch-mapped 
the site, and made additional collections. Weinstein and Kelley (1984:419- 
446) partially mapped, collected, and tested the site. It presently includes eight 
mounds, in various stages of preservation. Seven are arranged in a squarish 
trapezoidal pattern around a plaza. Apparently they were all truncated py¬ 
ramidal mounds, from 2 to 6.5 m above the adjacent surface. The other

mound, off to the east, is now only “an amorphous, low rise” that “has suc¬ 
cumbed to prodigious pothunting activity” and may have been a domed bur¬ 
ial mound (Weinstein and Kelley 1984:424-430, Figures 7-51 and 7-61). The 
deep, extensive middens and lower mound stages appear to date to the Coles 
Creek period and Gran Marais phase, whereas only part of the site and some 
mound tops were used by Caney Bayou peoples. 

Whole or nearly complete Gran Marais vessels from Boone’s Mounds were 
illustrated by Weinstein and Kelley (i984:Figures 7-53 through 7-55) and in¬ 
clude an Addis Plain open bowl with a scalloped rim (cf. the Boydell bowl), 
an Anna Incised open bowl, an Evansville Punctated jar, and a Lapile Incised 
jar with similarities to the Sanson Incised type (cf. Phillips 1970:159). Also 
present are several specimens of Caney Bayou, Caddoan, or “multicultural” 
types. An archaeomagnetic date range of a.d. 1270-1355 from one mound was 
attributed to the Gran Marais phase (Weinstein and Kelley 1984:421). In sum¬ 
mary, this was the “paramount site” of this phase in this portion of the region 
and “construction of most, if not all, of the mounds was probably completed 
during this time” (Weinstein and Kelley 1984:505). The site has been acquired 
by The Archaeological Conservancy. Several smaller Gran Marais sites are 
known in this vicinity (Weinstein and Kelley 1984:505, Figure 9-7). 

Beyond this cluster, only two Gran Marais components were found in the 
middle reaches of the survey and none in its upper reaches. The Keller Place, 
a short distance back from the river, described by Moore (1909:91-96), was 
more recently visited by Schambach, then by Weinstein and Kelley (1984:124- 
130), although it was out of their project area. It has at least six mounds, plus 
midden areas. Moore (1909:9^! ) gave a height estimate of 13 feet for Mound 
A, which he described as quadrangular, and 9.5, 3, and 2 feet respectively for 
three “circular” mounds. He found “human remains throughout” the second 
mound, representing at least 52 individuals. He also recovered 52 vessels with¬ 
out shell tempering, mostly badly crushed, but including some complete 
specimens (Moore i9C>9:Figures 94, 96, 97, Plate VI). One was a miniature 
with a decoration combining two Southern Cult motifs, the ogee and the 
barred oval. Also found were a pipe with a notched and engraved design and 
a copper-covered wooden rattle shaped like a large carnivore canine tooth 
(Moore i9C>9:Figures 92, 93, 95). Keller ceramic vessels in private collections 
include two Coleman Incised jars and one Kiam Incised jar with a punctated 
body (Weinstein and Kelley 1984:127, Figure 6-23). The site appears to have 
minor Coles Creek and Caney Bayou components, before and after a major 
Gran Marais component.

The Paw Paw site, a short distance upstream from Keller, has a succession 
of middens on a relict natural levee. It has been tested extensively and found 
to have been occupied variously between the Middle Archaic and Mississippi 
periods. It has major Coles Creek components and two Gran Marais compo¬ 
nents, including a deep midden (Kelley 1992:229-230; Weber 1973:8). Writing 
before the Gran Marais phase and the transitional Coles Creek concept had 
been defined, Weber (1973:68!!) made three subdivisions of “Plaquemine” 
strata, based on decorated ceramics. In the earliest, late varieties of Coles 
Creek Incised predominated. In the middle, sherds comparable to Mazique 
Incised, var Manchacwere dominant. In the latest levels, Plaquemine Brushed 
was most prevalent. 

The "Louisiana Felsenthal” and Lower Ouachita Regions 

Schambach (1981:105) tentatively placed the southern boundary of the Felsen¬ 
thal region near the juncture of Bayou Bartholomew with the Ouachita, a 
short distance above Monroe, Louisiana. Little modern work has been done 
in that locality, but some similarities to Arkansas have been found (Price and 
Heartfield 1977). The region’s southwestern quadrant was explored by Moore 
(1913) with little success. Recent work has produced some data from the Scott 
Place on Big Corney Bayou, just above its confluence with Bayou D’Arbonne 
(Harty 2005; Saunders 1998). Two of the five mounds are flat-topped, about 
3.6 m and 1.5 m high. In one, Moore encountered a burnt feature, which was 
relocated in 1998 and produced a radiocarbon date centering on a.d. 1250. No 
diagnostic sherds were associated, but those found elsewhere included Coles 
Creek Incised, var Hardy. Another mound site, about 25 km up the same 
stream, seems contemporary but ceramically closer to Caddoan culture (Harty 
1997:136-137). 

The major Plaquemine center in the Lower Ouachita region is Pargoud 
Landing, at Monroe (Gibson 1996:69). It may have had six mounds, the larg¬ 
est about 8.5 m high; at least one contained burials (Gibson 1996:70; cf. Kid¬ 
der 1990a:64). A "Pargoud phase” had been named (see Jeter et al. 1989:21^, 
Table 17) but was not really discussed until Kidder (19903:63-65, Figure 4) 
summarized and mapped it. He remarked that it probably belonged to “the 
same, as-of-yet undefined, culture as the Gran Marais phase . . . heavily influ¬ 
enced by Lower Mississippi Valley groups, probably by way of the Bartholo¬ 
mew phase of Plaquemine culture.” Meanwhile, Schambach (1990) moved 
Gran Marais back to Plaquemine cultural status, a subject not addressed by 
Kidder (1990a, 1991).

Subsistence, Agriculture, and Maize Again 

Again, flotation has been inadequately applied. Not surprisingly, macro¬ 
remains from flood-prone bankline sites include deer and small animal bones, 
mussel shells, some fish bones, and possible nutshell or seed fragments (Hem- 
mings 1982:171, 185, Table B-i; Kelley 1990, 1992). 

Schambach (1979:30, 1981:105-106) first hypothesized that some form of 
slash-and-burn agriculture had been practiced in the Felsenthal uplands. But, 
in the Bangs Slough report, he suggested that agriculture or even “horticul¬ 
ture” might have been “absent or unimportant in the Felsenthal region in all 
periods ” (Schambach 1990:120-122; emphasis added). Kidder (1991), however, 
remarked that sampling and recovery had been inadequate, and I (Jeter and 
Early 1999:53-54) have suggested that too much emphasis has been placed on 
the flood-prone lowlands, which even now have never been claimed for agri¬ 
culture. 

Other sites have produced indirect evidence with regard to late prehistoric 
agriculture. Faunal data from the lowland Paw Paw site suggested, among 
other possibilities, that late Coles Creek “clearing of gardens for horticulture 
was responsible for changes in small mammal frequencies” and that schedul¬ 
ing conflicts might have decreased summer and fall deer hunting and mussel 
collecting (Kelley 1990, 1992:237-238). 

Even if agriculture was well established by Plaquemine times, it may not 
have involved significant production of maize. The early Gran Marais adult 
male burial at Little Mud Lake “showed no evidence of dental caries, suggest¬ 
ing that his diet did not include large quantities of domesticated carbohy¬ 
drates such as maize” (Weinstein and Kelley 1984:412) but instead had a 
“moderate degree of dental wear” suggestive of “abrasive hunting and gather¬ 
ing diets” (Mires and Owsley 1984:565). Analyses by scanning electron mi¬ 
croscopy of a sample of teeth from protohistoric burials at the Gordon site 
found molar surfaces “fairly smooth” but with some large and small striations, 
indicating “a relatively soft diet, few abrasive particles, and the consumption 
of hickory nuts . . . substantially different from all other Lower Mississippi 
Valley molars... a distinctive diet” (Harmon and Rose 1989:331). These teeth 
also had a fairly high caries rate, possibly suggesting maize or other agricul¬ 
tural carbohydrates in the diet (Harmon and Rose 1989:324, 331-332, Table 38). 
Fritz and Kidder (1993:10) questioned the correlation between increased caries 
rates and maize, or even domesticated starchy seeds, suggesting instead that 
changes in wild plant processing technology might be implicated. More re¬ 
cent work suggests that starchy-seed domesticates were significant by early 



OUTER LIMITS OF PLAQUEMINE CULTURE 


I8 5 


Coles Creek times (Roberts 2004; Ryan 2004) and maize was at least present 
in the late Coles Creek subperiod. 

At Saline-Fifteen, the regions first direct evidence of maize emerged. Lopi- 
not (2007) found that it was virtually ubiquitous in feature and midden flota¬ 
tion samples. He suggested that its cultivation probably went beyond mere 
gardening and possibly involved production of surpluses. The maize itself has 
produced one date. Some if not most of it might belong to the Caney Bayou 
component, but the features, from which most maize remains were recovered, 
had relatively low percentages of shell-tempered pottery. Although the samples 
are small, this suggests that the features may represent the Gran Marais com¬ 
ponent, as does the AMS i-sigma range, cal. a.d. 1280-1300 (Beta-218342). 

Other plant remains included abundant hickory nuts, and acorns were 
common (Lopinot 2007). Persimmon and sumac were also present, but do¬ 
mesticates of the old Eastern starchy/oily seed complex were absent. In this 
regard, this site resembles the protohistoric (ca. a.d. 1600) Goldsmith Oliver 
2 site at Little Rock (Lopinot 1990). Faunal remains (Scott 2007) suggested at 
least multiseasonal, if not year-round, occupation and a strong reliance on 
deer, plus a few smaller mammals, along with fish, turtles, mussels, and even 
some calcined crawfish claws (cf. Hemmings 1982:185). 

Schambach’s original intuition about upland maize farming by Gran Marais 
peoples may well have been correct, at least for the later portion of this phase. 
Hemmings (1982:271) also suggested that the higher terrace margins, near the 
mound centers overlooking the Felsenthal lowlands, had provided land for 
farming. Such local ecotonal positions were probably emphasized (cf. also 
Saline-Fifteen). 


The Uplands 

The arbitrary boundary between the Bartholomew-Macon and Felsenthal re¬ 
gions runs along the upland drainage divide between Bayou Bartholomew and 
the Saline-Ouachita rivers (Jeter 1982:78-80, Figure 6-2). However, the up¬ 
land zone, about 40 km (ca. 25 miles) wide, is generally heavily wooded, 
punctuated by pastures and some small fields. Although known sites are rela¬ 
tively scarce and small, the database is quite inadequate, so it is not clear 
whether there is a clinal gradation or definite break between these regions’ 
Plaquemine phases or whether the uplands might have been occupied by a 
third group with a discernibly different assemblage. The few known upland 
sites are typically located along small streams and suggest cultural similarities 
with functional differentiation, that is, smaller and less permanent sites closer 



i86

to the drainage divide (e.g., Mooney et al. 2004:14^; University of Arkansas 
at Monticello Research Station files). 

There are hints of differential use of the uplands, most notably at the Clark 
site in eastern Ashley County, on the upland edge. There, in 1970, ama¬ 
teurs salvaged at least 50 vessels from a site that was being destroyed by sand- 
pitting. Preservation was very poor, but at least 10 to 12 burials were appar¬ 
ently of adults in the extended-supine position, with heads mainly to the 
north, some possibly in rows. The vessels are mainly crude, grog-tempered, 
relatively deep jars, some plain, some with combinations of sloppy Gran 
Marais rim incising and body punctating or pinching. Some vessels resemble 
Caddoan specimens, but there are more similarities to vessels from Pargoud, 
though at Clark, punctated body decorations were more common (Jeter 
1982:105; Jeter et al. 1989:216). No evidence of habitation was noted, so this 
may have been a specialized mortuary site. 

A similar situation, on a smaller scale, had been found at the Norrell site 
in northwestern Ashley County, again very close to the upland edge. In 1968, 
amateurs excavated 14 poorly preserved burials, all adults in extended-supine 
positions with heads generally to the southeast. Several were probably in rows. 
Nine vessels were recovered. They generally resemble those from the Clark 
site. Again, no evidence of habitation was observed. Sites like these may rep¬ 
resent a major mortuary practice of the peoples of these phases, possibly com¬ 
parable to the Mangum “Plaquemine necropolis” on an upland knoll in 
southwestern Mississippi (Bohannon 1963). 

Antecedents of Plaquemine Culture 

Were the changes from Coles Creek to Plaquemine culture largely gradual and 
continuous or mainly abrupt and discontinuous, and were their causes more 
likely endogenous or exogenous? I suspect complex combinations of such 
processes and causal factors, on varying spatial, temporal, and cultural scales 
(cf. Jeter 2003a). 

On the basis of work at major centers like Winterville and Lake George, 
Brain (1969, 1989) suggested that the change was rather sudden and at least 
partly exogenous, engendered by Mississippian out of Coles Creek, as it were: 
“an intrusion that had a vitally stimulating effect, which resulted in the cli¬ 
mactic Plaquemine culture” (Williams and Brain 1983:376). This was seen as 
being evidenced by “Cahokia horizon” artifacts around the late 1100s, with 
the Winterville phase of Plaquemine culture as a hybrid of Mississippian and 
Coles Creek traits (Brain 1989:108-110,117-122; Williams and Brain 1983:374- 
375). Griffin (1990:68-72) argued that Cahokian influence had been over-

emphasized and that any such contacts had occurred significantly earlier, 
around a.d. 1050 in the then-extant chronology (Griffin 1990:71). Recent re¬ 
calibrations would move this into the 1100s (cf. Emerson and Girard 2004). 

Rolingson (1976:119) suggested that the Bartholomew phase might repre¬ 
sent instead a northward “intrusion of Plaquemine peoples . . . out of either 
the Tensas Basin or the Ouachita . . . Valley.” Belmont (1985:279) found a 
Boeuf Basin settlement shift from south to north between Coles Creek and 
Plaquemine times (cf. Kidder 19903:67), indirectly supporting Rolingson’s hy¬ 
pothesis. However, there is also evidence for in-place continuity from Coles 
Creek antecedents, which are difficult to recognize because of the dominance 
of plainware. For Boydell Mound A, House saw “a strong case . . . for conti¬ 
nuity across this span of a.d. 900 to 1200 and beyond” (House and Jeter 
1994:77). Intensive surveys around Boydell (Jeter et al. 2007) produced arti¬ 
facts suggestive of at least two and possibly eight small Coles Creek sites. At 
Taylor Mound 3, the late 1100s Stage III surface yielded terminal Coles Creek 
artifacts, topped by Stage IV with an early 1200s date (Jeter, ed. 2007). 

Schambach (1979:30) remarked that at least some mounds in each of 11 
major Felsenthal groups were built or begun during the Coles Creek period, 
and all of these groups appeared to have been maintained, added to, and used 
as cemetery areas by Plaquemine people. Later, he saw the Cypress Swamp 
phase as transitional and “clearly ancestral” to Gran Marais (Schambach 
1990:120-121). Weinstein and Kelley (1984:505) found in Gran Marais “a con¬ 
tinuation of site occupation,” with Boones Mounds continuing as the para¬ 
mount site, as during Coles Creek times. Data from Paw Paw also support 
continuity (Weber 1973). 

Down the Ouachita Valley, Gibson (1996:69) saw Plaquemine culture as 
“little more than an evolved pottery complex, not a radically new way of life.” 
He added that although realignments of settlements took place, they could 
have been merely changes of locations or “adaptational, as peoples took to the 
swamps paralleling the rivers.” There seems to have been a strong Coles Creek- 
Plaquemine continuum in the Tensas (Rolingson 1976:118; cf. Hally 1972:3081!). 

Sociopolitical Organization, Change, and Relations 

Social organization has not been intensively explored for Plaquemine phases 
in these regions. But it can at least be outlined on several scales: within phases, 
between phases (or site clusters), between regions, and by comparisons with 
the LMV and greater Southeast. 

About all we have for the dubious Bellaire phase are hints of associa¬ 
tions with a few sites and that elite-looking serpent-cat pipe. For the Bar- 



i88 


MARVIN D. JETER 


tholomew phase, Rolingson (1976) noted the presence of small ceremonial 
centers, plus a simple, size-based hierarchy of non-mound sites and an “out¬ 
standing lack... of status goods” in burials (Rolingson 1976:116). She did 
add, though, that “some status distinctions” might be indicated by finds of 
better ceramics and a figurine at a ceremonial center. Along the bayou, I have 
noted a tendency for nonlocal quartz crystals to be associated with mound 
centers and perhaps also burial sites. Another indication of distinctions is 
the possibility that marginal individuals were buried at small hamlets like 
McArthur, while higher-status people may have been buried in mounds as at 
Boydell and/or at specialized upland cemeteries, such as Clark. Use of charnel 
houses, as evidenced by bundle burials, suggests more elaborate treatment for 
some of the populace. 

The Cypress Swamp phase has been identified only at one extractive site. 
The Gran Marais phase is associated with some large mounds and multi¬ 
mound sites, and the apparent hierarchy of such sites may reflect a “complex 
chiefdom” though site functions and seasonality may be factors (Weinstein 
and Kelley 1984:511-512). Despite a few Southern Cult finds, definite high- 
status burials are unknown. However, it is of interest that some of the largest 
Gran Marais centers are close to the apparent border with Caddoan cultural 
territory and that Southern Cult items have been found in that vicinity. Simi¬ 
larly, the multimound Taylor site is near the northern limit of the Bartholo¬ 
mew phase and has produced some likely Cahokian materials. 

Meanwhile, east of the Mississippi very large mound sites like Winterville 
and smaller mound centers were flourishing, though again high-status burials 
are unknown. To our south, especially in the Tensas Basin, similar things were 
going on (Hally 1972). By comparison with those heartland ceremonial cen¬ 
ters, the Bartholomew and even Gran Marais centers look relatively simple. 

Another large-scale question deals with interactions between Arkansas 
Plaquemine peoples and other Plaquemine groups, Mississippians, and Cad- 
doans. The most distinctive ceramic and arrow point types have different dis¬ 
tributions, which might be related to differing male and female roles in inter¬ 
regional communication and/or marriage and residence rules. Ashley points 
may suggest a relatively restricted male communication zone, including south¬ 
east Arkansas and regions to the west. It did not extend east across the Mis¬ 
sissippi or much south of the present Louisiana state line, and was smaller 
than the preceding Homan distribution zone. Such an interaction zone may 
relate to communications about how to shape points rather than actual ex¬ 
change, as the points were made predominantly on local pebble raw materials. 

Assuming that the pottery was basically produced and decorated by 
women, they apparently had a different zone of communication and interac-

tion. It extended about as far north and perhaps as far west (the “boundary” 
with Caddoan ceramics was certainly permeable, at least for some decorative 
techniques and styles), but it also reached across the Mississippi and signifi¬ 
cantly farther to the south, as indicated by the basic ceramic paste recipes, 
decorative techniques, and designs. This possibility of a larger interaction 
zone for Plaquemine women would be in accord with some recent Old World 
studies, which indicate that “surprisingly, in general females seem to have 
stirred the genetic melting pot by dispersing their DNA more widely than 
their brothers” (Pennisi 2001:1733), implying that “patrilocal societies . . . have 
dominated during the past several millennia, most likely emerging with the 
growing dependence on agriculture,” although these findings are still tentative 
and contested (Pennisi 2001:1734). There is a tremendous potential for DNA 
studies in the LMY, but because of political considerations it may remain 
unfulfilled (Jeter 2002a:i95-i96, 2003^186-188). 

On a still larger scale, an interesting contour map suggests that chiefdom 
organization spread very rapidly down the Mississippi Valley (Anderson 
i999:Figure 15.5), from northeast Arkansas around a.d. 950 to the Red River 
mouth by about 1000. Whether or not this is precisely correct (it postdates 
major developments at Toltec), it certainly suggests that chiefdoms preceded 
Plaquemine culture and were fueled largely by the Native Eastern domesti¬ 
cated plants and wild resources, before the southward spread of significant 
dependence on maize. 

Other recent studies have found some evidence for incipient stratification 
by late Coles Creek times in northeast Louisiana (Ryan 2004:247-248; Wells 
1998). Gibson (1996:60) professed a “general impression ... of population re¬ 
duction and growing sectionalism.” Whereas there had been 17 known Coles 
Creek mound centers along the Ouachita in Louisiana, there were only 13 with 
Plaquemine components, “usually minor, and . . . dominant only at six sites” 
(Gibson 1996:69), perhaps indicating unsettled times. Some of this instability, 
along with settlement shifts, could be symptomatic of sociopolitical factors. 
Perhaps there was a disintegration of earlier Coles Creek-Plaquemine spatial- 
cultural continuity in the Tensas-Lower Ouachita regions, followed by some 
northward migration and, especially in the Felsenthal region, closer affilia¬ 
tions with Caddoan peoples. Maybe some people voted with their feet to es¬ 
cape incipient chiefly elitism along the Mississippi River. 

Environmental Factors 

Perhaps there were also exogenous factors, such as climate change. Rolingson 
(1976:1041!) not only began studying the southeast Arkansas environment via 
nineteenth-century General Land Office notes and historic flood data but also

looked for connections with global climatic change. She suggested that a 
warm, moist climatic optimum between about a.d. iooo and 1200, followed 
by a relatively warm, dry climate, might have made the alluvial valley envi¬ 
ronment more attractive. A Little Ice Age, dating around a.d. 1430-1850, 
might then have been a factor in a post-Bartholomew population drop (Rol- 
ingson 1976:109—110). 

The dates for these global changes have recently been pushed back and 
their nature has been clarified, with implications of cultural impacts. Accord¬ 
ing to LeBlanc (1999, 2001:45; LeBlanc and Rice 2001:12), a “Medieval [Euro¬ 
pean] Warm Period,” with virtually worldwide, relatively warm and wet 
conditions, occurred about a.d. 900-1150. During that span, maize-based 
populations grew substantially in the agriculturally marginal Southwest. This 
period also saw the rise of Cahokia, where some see a “Big Bang” of consoli¬ 
dation around a.d. 1050, followed by a century or more of relative prosperity 
and cultural climax or hegemony (Emerson 2002:135-136; Pauketat 2002). It 
appears that this was not initially fueled by maize, which was present but up 
to a.d. 1100 or later was only one of a number of cultigens, along with Native 
Eastern plants, in a “multicropping” situation (Lopinot 2003:144-145). In the 
LMV, Coles Creek cultures flourished and began their transitions to Plaque- 
mine, apparently with even less dependence on maize (Fritz and Kidder 1993; 
Kidder and Fritz 1993:293-295; Roberts 2004, 2005). 

By the late 1100s, populations in the marginal Southwest “may have caught 
up with the increased [carrying] capacity, and by the middle 1200s the climate 
began to deteriorate into . . . the Little Ice Age” (LeBlanc and Rice 2001:12). 
There were significant “drier and colder” conditions (LeBlanc 2001:45). In the 
Southwest, “conflict. . . was the consequence” (LeBlanc and Rice 2001:12), 
with large-scale warfare beginning around a.d. 1250 (cf. Lekson 2002). 

In the less marginal Midwest, between a.d. iioo and 1250 maize became 
dominant (Lopinot 2003:146). Cahokia prospered on a reduced scale for some 
decades but suffered a “precipitous and abrupt decline” around a.d. 1300. This 
is attributed by some to “political and social collapse” (Emerson 2002:137-139) 
but the picture of subsistence during the decades of decline is “less clear” 
(Emerson 2002:138), and climate change may have been an underlying factor. 

Between Cahokia and Plaquemine country, maize also took over between 
a.d. 1100 and 1250 (Lopinot 2003:144, 146). A “shift to greater control by 
[chiefdoms] ” accompanied by the spread of early Southern Cult martial ico¬ 
nography and aggregation of formerly independent chiefdoms “may have be¬ 
gun in earnest after about. . . 1250” (Morse and Morse 1983:247-250, 271). 
Whether a change to colder, drier conditions was a major factor remains to be

explored on a region-by-region basis, but Mississippian elements expanded 
southward into northern Plaquemine territory during the 1300s and beyond 
the present Arkansas-Louisiana line by around 1500 (Jeter et al. I989:i7iff, 
Figures 17-21), as adverse climate peaked (LeBlanc 2001:45). Meanwhile, 
within northeast Louisiana Plaquemine culture, maize agriculture may not 
have really intensified until shortly before 1400 (Fritz and Kidder 1993:11; but 
cf. Roberts 2005; Wells and Weinstein, this volume). 

Other aspects of such a process might have included settlement-subsistence 
shifts. One alternative to emphasizing maize in this sunny “Sportsman’s Para¬ 
dise” would have been to turn back to more reliance on hunting, gathering 
wild plants, and wetland-riverine resources. Much of the western Plaquemine 
territory is taken up by lowlands, including very low, seasonally flooded wet¬ 
lands. A detailed comparative analysis of the Felsenthal situation with that in 
the Catahoula Basin of eastern Louisiana would be of great interest (Gregory 
1969; Gregory et al. 1987; Jeter et al. 1989:213). 

Mississippian(?) Successors 

Shell tempering gradually became more common in Arkansas Plaquemine as¬ 
semblages until it became dominant and they became Mississippian for ar¬ 
chaeologists. Inconsistently, the dominance of shell tempering has not con¬ 
ferred full Mississippian status on other societies such as Caddoan, Fort 
Ancient, and Oneota. The dominance of shell appears to have marched down 
the Mississippi Valley at an average rate of about 60 to 75 km per century 
(Jeter 20031x184; Jeter et al. i989:Figures 16-21). By the mid-i300s, it had 
crossed the Arkansas River. By the 1500s it had moved into northeast Loui¬ 
siana. 

I continue to interpret this process as mainly one of cultural diffusion of 
shell-tempering technology rather than migration with population replace¬ 
ment (Jeter 1986:49, 2002a:2io), but there are other possibilities. Noting Neo¬ 
lithic expansion northwestward into Europe at about 100 km per century 
(Cavalli-Sforza 1996), I wonder whether our situation was also largely or 
partly a case of population replacement via migration (“demic diffusion” in 
Cavalli-Sforza’s terms) or some complex combination of these processes, along 
with some biological interbreeding (Jeter 20031x183-188). The large-scale 
DNA analyses necessary to test this hypothesis seem unlikely to be conducted. 

Meanwhile, several lines of evidence suggest a good degree of cultural con¬ 
tinuity. In the Yazoo Basin, “Mississippianization” was “a gradual affair” 
(Williams and Brain 1983:392). In southeast Arkansas, like the Plaquemine 
peoples before them, the regional Mississippians had dispersed settlement pat-

terns of small hamlets, farmsteads, and temporary foraging sites, focused on 
a local ceremonial (mound and/or charnel ho use/cemetery) center, rather than 
the nucleated agricultural villages and larger polities of the Mississippians to 
the north. In a preliminary paper, Rolingson (1972) referred to the Bartholo¬ 
mew phase as a rural variant of Plaquemine culture. Independently, I used the 
phrase “rural Mississippian” for these same regions (Jeter et al. 1979), borrow¬ 
ing the phrase from Goldstein’s (1976) work in west-central Illinois. 

Furthermore, there is some artifactual evidence for continuity. Major deco¬ 
rative ideas apparently spread from south to north (e.g., Mazique to Barton 
rectilinear incising, Coleman to Winterville and other curvilinear incising, 
Evansville to Parkin fingernail punctating, Plaquemine to Grace brushing), 
while the transition from grog to shell tempering spread in the other direction 
(Hally 1972:624-625). Although settlement concentration shifted from the 
Bartholomew locality to the Tillar vicinity, our surveys in between have 
turned up small habitation sites with varying percentages of shell- versus grog- 
tempered pottery. I see them as something like Ford’s ideal seriation sub¬ 
jects, catching brief intervals of time in the process of change from grog to 
shell tempering. In his Felsenthal bottomland surveys, Hemmings (1982:1551!, 
263-266) found evidence of varying percentages of grog- and shell-tempered 
ceramics in the Gran Marais-Caney Bayou transition. Similarly, at Saline- 
Fifteen (Jeter 2007b), four test units all produced about 50-percent shell- 
tempered sherds from the lower portion of a midden and over 70 percent from 
its upper portion. 

More Distant Successors? 

If the rural Mississippians of southeast Arkansas were indeed basically the 
descendants of rural Plaquemine peoples in these same regions, who were 
their further protohistoric and early historic descendants, in the ethnic/tribal 
sense and linguistically? One possibility, assuming still further continuity, is 
that Tunican speakers, perhaps including the Koroa, who were ethnohistori- 
cally documented in these regions in the late 1600s, were their descendants 
(cf. Jeter 1986; Kidder 1988; Rolingson 1976:118; Schambach 1981:106). Brain 
(1988:273) suggested that “the” Tunica homeland at the time of Spanish con¬ 
tact in 1541 was in northwest Mississippi but that “Tunica forebears” had ar¬ 
rived there from southeast Arkansas a short time earlier, “leaving behind those 
who went on to produce the Tillar complex.” A radically different view of the 
Tunican homeland, as being in the Oklahoma-Arkansas borderlands along 
the Arkansas Valley, was later proposed by Schambach (1999). I disagree with 



OUTER LIMITS OF PLAQUEMINE CULTURE 


193 


his placement (and Brain’s) but agree that Tunicans had not yet been based in 
southeast Arkansas by Spanish-contact times. 

I recently suggested another alternative, a “Tunicans and Northern Natch- 
ezans” scenario, implying major protohistoric discontinuities (Jeter 2002a:2o6- 
213, Figure 2). I still believe that this provides a better explanation of what 
Soto and his Merry Men found along their winding 1540s transect of Arkan¬ 
sas. Using the Hudson (1985, 1993) revision of the route for the locations of 
various Indian provinces and settlements, but assuming that Swanton (1939) 
was basically right about which Indian language families their names repre¬ 
sent, the Tunican names are clustered along the southeastern to southern 
Ozark margins and adjacent lowlands, from extreme northeast Arkansas (Pa- 
caha) to well up the Arkansas Valley (Tanico). This Tunican homeland place¬ 
ment is between the extremes suggested on the east by Brain and to the west 
by Schambach. 

More relevant here, this also places speakers of Natchezan languages all over 
the rest of eastern Arkansas, including all of southeastern to south-central 
Arkansas, and well up the Arkansas Valley, in the 1540s. I suggest that this 
implies a basic human biological and linguistic “Northern Natchezan” conti¬ 
nuity in and near southeast Arkansas from late prehistoric times, perhaps back 
to a.d. 1000 or earlier, until contact in the 1540s. Meanwhile, the cultural 
(archaeological) assemblage had been changing from Coles Creek to Plaque- 
mine in the 1100s and, largely via technological diffusion, to Mississippian in 
the 1300s to 1400s. Similarly, a bit later, the Caddoan biological, ethnic, and 
linguistic traditions were probably continuous in and near southwest Arkan¬ 
sas, but their ceramics were also becoming mostly shell tempered. 

Rolingson (1976:118) also mentioned possible connections between the 
Bartholomew and subsequent Wilmot phases and the historic Taensa, instead 
of Tunican speakers. The Taensa were almost certainly Natchezan speakers, 
first documented in northeast Louisiana in the late 1600s, but I have sug¬ 
gested that they may have migrated there from eastern Arkansas and/or north¬ 
western Mississippi in the late 1500s to mid-i6oos (Jeter 2002a:2io-2ii). 

After the Spanish eyitrada, and possibly because of it (Ramenofsky and 
Galloway 1997) but not necessarily so (Brain 1988:293), the Tunican and 
“Northern Natchezan” peoples of Arkansas may have been decimated by Eu¬ 
ropean diseases during the later 1500s and earlier 1600s, the 130-year “Proto- 
historic Dark Ages” with no direct European contact at all but some indirect 
contact via trade goods (Jeter 2007c; M. Smith 1987,1990). Alternatively, they 
may have been decimated by severe droughts between the 1540s and 1590s

(Burnett and Murray 1993:235-236; Stahle et al. 1985; Stahle et al. 2000; cf. 
Mainfort 2004:6-7). In any event, I suggest (Jeter 2002a:2ioff) that they be¬ 
gan moving southward during this period, as per the general trend in the rest 
of the interior Southeast (cf. Smith 1987, 2000, 2002). 

By the time of the first French contacts in the 1670s and 1680s, the “North¬ 
ern Natchezans” were already out of Arkansas and northwest Mississippi and 
may be represented by peoples such as the Taensa, whose Mississippian ar¬ 
chaeological assemblage in their supposed northeast Louisiana homeland sur¬ 
prised Phillips (1970:945). Some remnant Tunicans were then in the Lower 
Arkansas Valley and southeast Arkansas but were out of Arkansas themselves 
by a.d. 1700 (Jeter 1986). In their place, or near it, in the vicinity of the 
Arkansas-Mississippi river juncture, were the Quapaw. I have suggested that 
they had come from well up the Ohio Valley around 1660, as very late arrivals 
in what came to be known as their historic homeland by this fluke of discov¬ 
ery (Jeter 2002a:2i3ff)—but that’s another story. 

To summarize, I see a basic biological and linguistic continuity of south¬ 
east Arkansas populations of late prehistoric (including Plaquemine) to middle 
protohistoric (Mississippian) “Northern Natchezans,” on the margins of more 
elaborate cultural entities. Finally, they were caught up in the storm of “Co¬ 
lumbian consequences” (Jeter 2002b) and forced to migrate at some time be¬ 
tween the 1540s and 1670s southward toward their “Southern Natchezan” kin.

Ian Brown, David Hally, and T. R. Kidder, and our Louisiana and Mississippi 
colleagues, especially Doug Wells and Joanne Ryan, and also including Jon 
Gibson, Pete Gregory, Rich Weinstein, David Kelley, Joe Saunders, Chip

Various members of the Arkansas Archeological Society have helped over 
the long haul, most notably Ed and Patsy White, who have been formally 
involved in Arkansas archaeology since the 1960s. Especially memorable are 
the Gordon site project, our survey work around the Boydell site, and our 
work at Eagle Lake, performed along with Bob Cooper, the late Armin Dres- 
sel, and a number of other Society members and University of Arkansas at 
Monticello students. My former assistant Hank McKelway helped us with the 
Boydell survey and a number of other efforts, including some in the Felsenthal 
bottomlands, where it was our pleasure to assist Tom Hemmings and his crew 
a bit and to learn a lot. My present assistant, Bob Scott, has worked very 
productively with our collections. As always, I am grateful to my beloved 
blushing bride of a decade now, Charlotte Copeland, who accompanied me 
on the arduous highway journey to Charlotte, North Carolina, and back, and 
provided constant support and encouragement while I was expanding, then 
contracting, the manuscript for publication. 

This essay is dedicated to my distinguished Survey colleagues Martha Rol- 
ingson, Frank Schambach, and John House, with great respect and apprecia¬ 
tion for a quarter century of collegial research, providing much of the infor¬ 
mation that I have used (if not misused) here. By the time I got here, Martha 
had already done the groundwork and first major publications on the Bar¬ 
tholomew phase and Frank was well on the way to defining the Gran Marais 
phase and setting up the innovative descriptive ceramic classification system. 
Martha has gone on to great things at Toltec, and I wish her a long and pro¬ 
ductive retirement. Frank has contributed very extensive and welcome e- 
mailed comments and discussions. More recently, he has announced his own 
impending retirement; may it bring still more significant publications! And 
when I first arrived, John was starting the final salvage at the doomed Boydell 
Mound A. When I joined him there, I asked, “Just what is this Plaquemine 
culture, anyhow?” and he replied, “It’s. . . just a bunch of sherds.” Through 
the efforts of “all of the above,” I think it is something more than that now. 
However, I am responsible for any errors or misinterpretations that may be 
found in this essay.

Contemplating Plaquemine Culture 

Tristram R. Kidder 


The essays in this volume demonstrate that Plaquemine research is alive and 
well. Moreover, prospects for further research are excellent; new ideas are be¬ 
ing explored and old ones put to the test. Central problems in Plaquemine 
research emphasized in these contributions include, Where does this society 
(or is it “these societies”?) come from? How do we identify, define, and con¬ 
ceptualize Plaquemine in relation to its ancestors, its contemporaries, and its 
descendants? What are the spatial, economic, ritual, and political variations 
among Plaquemine societies and how does this variability reflect on concepts 
of Plaquemine as a cultural construct? What external influences affect the 
historical development of Plaquemine peoples? What is the place of Plaque¬ 
mine in the larger social and economic landscape of the Southeast? 

These new ideas are developing at a time when research on Mississippian 
societies throughout the Southeast is at an exciting new stage: increasing evi¬ 
dence of regional variation is complemented by emerging ideas of economic, 
political, and ritual domination by a limited number of centers, notably Ca- 
hokia, Etowah, and Moundville (Anderson 1997; King 2001, 2003; Knight 
1997; Knight and Steponaitis 1998; Pauketat 2002, 2004). The essays in this 
volume place Plaquemine in a local and regional context and serve not only 
as a regional synthesis of a poorly understood culture and temporal period in 
the Lower Mississippi Valley (LMV) but also as a springboard for developing 
new research and for probing the larger issues of how late pre-Hispanic socie¬ 
ties in the Southeast developed and were maintained. 

In his landmark summary of the archaeology of the LMV, Phillips (1970:5— 
8, Figure 2) made an important but often ignored distinction in terminology. 
He defined the Mississippi period as a temporal unit but distinguished Missis¬ 
sippian from Plaquemine culture. These are subtle nomenclatural distinctions, 



CONTEMPLATING PLAQUEMINE CULTURE

but they bear serious consideration in light of our emerging understanding of 
the southeastern cultural landscape after circa a.d. 1000. Phillips needed these 
terms to set Plaquemine apart as a unique cultural entity, but he also recog¬ 
nized the remarkable cultural, material, political, social, settlement, subsistence, 
and ritual variability among the populations now lumped into Mississippian 
“culture” during what is usually referred to as the Mississippian “period.” Not 
all people living in or at the margins of the Southeast after a.d. 1000 were 
culturally Mississippians and perhaps it is time our terminology caught up 
with this apparent reality. In the following discussion I use the term Mississippi 
period as a temporal unit for the time frame from circa a.d. 1000 to European 
contact. Plaquemine and Mississippian are reserved to denote different cultural 
groups or, probably more accurately, groups practicing different cultural be¬ 
haviors. Archaeologists working with the late pre-Hispanic populations in the 
Southeast should give thought to the value of distinguishing temporal units 
from cultural content. 

Like many culture historical constructs in the Southeast, Plaquemine is 
built on a foundation made of fired clay. This use of ceramics as an indicator 
of cultural affiliation is most notable in the distinction between Mississippian 
and Plaquemine. Mississippian culture in the Mississippi Valley has often 
been associated with the use of shell as a tempering agent in pottery (Phillips 
1970). Shell temper in pottery has been used for some time to denote the 
distinction between Mississippian and Plaquemine and is the basis for assum¬ 
ing that people who used one or the other of these tempering technologies 
were culturally distinct populations. Research presented in this volume (e.g., 
Livingood, Wells and Weinstein) reinforces arguments that shell tempering 
has been overemphasized as a marker of cultural distinction. While there is 
no doubt different groups in the LMV had diverse behaviors and distinct 
cultural affiliations, to suggest that the use of a single technological attribute 
is sufficient to distinguish large-scale cultural differences is probably simplistic 
and does not do justice to the remarkable complexity witnessed in late prehis¬ 
tory. In the LMV, shell-tempered pottery is neither an absolute hallmark of 
Mississippi period occupations nor is it a certain marker of cultural affiliation. 

Shell tempering is most common in the northern portions of the valley and 
the technology appears to have been slowly spreading southward after a.d. 1200 
(Hally 1972; Williams and Brain 1983). In the Delta region of the coast shell 
tempering appears to have been introduced or diffused from farther east, no¬ 
tably the Mobile Bay area of Alabama (Brown 2004; Kidder 2004b). Pottery 
manufactured in the area between Vicksburg, Mississippi, and Baton Rouge 
was most commonly tempered with a mixture of well-crushed grog supple-

mented with bone, shell, and even vegetable matter alone or in combination 
(identified as Addis ware) (Phillips 1970; Ryan 2004; Williams and Brain 
1983). Mississippi period ceramic technology is quite sophisticated, with ves¬ 
sels often being very well fired with thin walls and flat or round bases. Vessel 
shapes are very diverse and probably functionally specialized. In addition to 
standard bowls, jars, and beakers, Mississippi period vessel assemblages fre¬ 
quently include bottles, jars of various forms, bowls with complex vessel 
shapes, and unique or exotic compound vessels. 

Mississippi period ceramic decoration in the LMV embodies both hold¬ 
overs from earlier times as well as new styles and expressions. Rectilinear pat¬ 
terns so common in Coles Creek times diminish in frequency but are never 
fully replaced. Simple rectilinear incising parallel to or set at an angle to the 
rim of simple vessels is a familiar characteristic in most assemblages. Brushing 
becomes common, and various curvilinear incised design styles come into 
vogue by the thirteenth century. Across the region so-called Mississippian 
styles are frequently found on local (non-shell tempered) wares while ances¬ 
tral (mostly rectilinear) styles are in many instances executed on shell-tempered 
vessels. Painting, most often monochrome reds or red and white polychrome 
designs, is a minority style in the northern and central parts of the valley but 
never catches on in the Delta region or along the coast. Many of the designs 
or design combinations are unique to specific sites or regions, but some pan- 
southeastern styles can be detected. A common shared trait is the sun circle, 
which is manifest in a variety of forms (including running scroll, cross-in-circle, 
guilloche, and swastika). Although pottery with Southeastern Ceremonial 
Complex designs and motifs is found in surrounding regions, especially to the 
north and east, it is rare in the Mississippi Valley south of the mouth of the 
Arkansas River. In the Mississippi Delta vessel fragments with Southeastern 
Ceremonial Complex design characteristics have been recovered and indicate 
an extensive trade relationship with Pensacola (Moundville-related or influ¬ 
enced) groups along the eastern Gulf coast. A better grasp of Plaquemine 
ceramic technology, style, and decoration is important for our understanding 
of temporal, economic, and social variation; however, as noted by Livingood 
(this volume), the returns on traditional type-variety research at present are 
limited. New analytic methods and approaches are required to breathe new 
life into our rather moribund approach to ceramics that historically empha¬ 
sizes typology over any other information. 

In reading these essays there is a sense of deja vu. Many of the issues raised 
here echo those surrounding the debates on Mississippian Emergence in the 
1980s (Fortier and McElrath 2002; J. Kelly 1987, 1990; B. Smith 1984, 1990). 



CONTEMPLATING PLAQUEMINE CULTURE 


199 


Then, as now, there were debates about cultural identity and cultural, social, 
economic, and political variability; I will focus on these issues for the rest of 
this discussion with a few excursions into related matters. 

One of the issues raised by these essays is that of analytical scale (notably 
spatial scale and temporal resolution). Issues of scale are embedded in ar¬ 
chaeological research and are certainly not new to the archaeology of eastern 
North America (Blakeslee 2002; Neitzel 2000; Neitzel and Anderson 1999). 
Concepts of Plaquemine cultural identity and variability play out at different 
scales of analysis and thus these debates are critical because they frame theo¬ 
retical and methodological investigations of Plaquemine archaeology. 

At what spatial level do we analyze Plaquemine? Scholars working in the 
LMV have oscillated between polar extremes in identifying Plaquemine as a 
cultural entity. For example, James Griffin (1967) in his summary of eastern 
North America classified Plaquemine as a “variant” of Mississippian culture, 
and Jeffrey Brain (1978, 1989, 1991) has argued that Plaquemine arose from 
local roots as a consequence of stimulation by northern “Mississippian” neigh¬ 
bors. More recently, I have championed a parochial definition emphasizing 
the local roots of Plaquemine (Kidder 1998b, 2002, 2004b). Regardless of 
their merits, these discussions emphasize that scale matters in understand¬ 
ing Plaquemine. The discussions in this volume and in earlier papers direct 
our focus toward the processes of “Mississippianization” in the LMV. This 
emphasis is very relevant, as it places the archaeology of the LMV within 
the larger context of discussions of how Mississippi period societies evolved 
and how they were connected and integrated. As a theoretical dimension 
these issues challenge us to explore how “Mississippian” is internalized and 
expressed—or if it is at all. Such a challenge removes us considerably from 
debates about shell versus non-shell tempering. While these essays show that 
we can argue about the how and why and specific details of what makes 
Plaquemine a distinctive cultural entity, we should not lose sight of the broad¬ 
est context because, no matter how we parse it, Plaquemine is a “Mississip¬ 
pian” culture when scaled to a continental perspective. 

Acknowledging the relevance of the spatial scale also begets a comment 
about temporal resolution. The origins of Plaquemine seem to be reasonably 
fixed at circa a.d. 1150-1250, with a.d. 1200 as a reasonable but arbitrary be¬ 
ginning date. However, we should recognize that how we view temporal reso¬ 
lution is important to our interpretation of Plaquemine history. Clearly, fine¬ 
grained temporal resolution is vital for our understanding of the historical 
development of societies through time. This challenge becomes critical when 
we explore the nature and form of apparently contemporary material culture 



200

variability (and, by extension, social and cultural variability). The essays in 
this volume demonstrate that contemporary Plaquemine groups manifest 
considerable variability across space. Defining the temporal boundaries of this 
variability and exploring time-space relationships within the LMV will be 
critical, as will using these data to explore how this region fits within the 
broader “Mississippian” world. There appears to be a growing sense that Mis- 
sissippian origins are the result of rapid transformations, possibly at a few key 
centers (Pauketat 1992, 2004). This punctuated equilibrium model has impor¬ 
tant ramifications for understanding Plaquemine but it requires temporal sen¬ 
sitivity and a continued emphasis on solid, high-resolution chronologies. 

Part of the issue of identity is recognizing boundaries, and many of the 
essays in this volume implicitly touch on this issue. What is the core of Plaque¬ 
mine? How do we define this core? These issues are especially evident along a 
north-south geographic axis. The valley walls largely (but clearly not entirely) 
bound Plaquemine, but is the geographic and cultural core centered on Larose, 
Baton Rouge, Natchez, or Greenville? If mound building defines the core then 
the center is between Greenville, Mississippi, and Jonesville, Louisiana; but 
should we be influenced by mass? Perhaps we should be asking whether there 
is even a core of Plaquemine culture. This issue is not entirely an esoteric 
argument among specialists. If the study of Plaquemine is to have relevance 
beyond the LM Y then understanding where Plaquemine exists is as important 
as understanding what it is. Models of cultural origin (e.g., Mississippianiza- 
tion vs. indigenous origins) turn on how cultural processes took place and 
where (and when) they occurred. 

In this regard, Jeter’s documentation (this volume; see also Jeter and Wil¬ 
liams 1989) of “rural” Plaquemine in the northwest “frontier” region suggests 
several important issues. One, of course, is that there is such a concept as a 
frontier or non-core population. And by his use of the term and his explicit 
discussion, Jeter clearly feels that there is a core for Plaquemine. Jeter also 
invokes the concept of a cosmopolitan population living in the major river 
valley in contrast to “rural” groups in small tributary valleys. Research in the 
Ouachita Valley provides evidence that there is a considerable Plaquemine-like 
occupation extending north to the Felsenthal region (Kelley 1984; Kidder 
1990a; Schambach 1990). Are these groups, sometimes identified as “Plad- 
doan” (a supposed fusion of Plaquemine and Caddoan cultural traits), really 
peripheral, or do they deserve their own status as equal partners in some sort 
of larger Plaquemine political and cultural universe? Similarly, work by Liv- 
ingood (this volume) in the Pearl River valley demonstrates that character¬ 
istics of Plaquemine culture moved outside of the valley wall confines of the

Mississippi and invites the question of where the eastern boundaries of this 
culture lie. 

Perhaps more important, these populations living “on the edge” provoke 
the question of how they developed the characteristics we recognize as Plaque- 
mine. Are these groups derived from populations that were once living in the 
core area (presumably the LMV proper) and that budded off to inhabit new 
territories? Are they local indigenous populations that have adopted Plaque- 
mine cultural traits? If we recognize peripheral populations then we encourage 
questions about how these populations interacted and how (and if) they were 
related. In this regard I would note that the distribution of Plaquemine popu¬ 
lations is largely isomorphic with that of Coles Creek. 

Scholars have in many instances observed that the geographic, ethnographic, 
and historical “center” of Plaquemine culture can be defined by the ethno- 
graphically known Natchez, who were the final manifestation of Plaquemine 
in historic times (Brain 1978,1989; Brown 1985a, 1985b; Brown and Brain 1983; 
Neitzel 1965, 1983). But the Natchez were not the only inheritors of the 
Plaquemine legacy. Rees (this volume) points out that the Natchez were not 
the biological end of Plaquemine; there are living Plaquemine descendants 
today in the Chitimacha. Further, the archaeological boundaries of Plaque¬ 
mine culture encompassed at the time of European contact significant ethnic 
and linguistic diversity (Foster 1996; Haas 1940, 1956, 1971, 1979), with not 
only Natchezan speakers (e.g., the Natchez, Taensa) but also those who spoke 
Tunican (the Tunica, Koroa), Chitimacha (the Chitimacha, Ouacha/Chawasha), 
and southern Muskhogean (the Bayougoula). Thus, Plaquemine “culture” 
crosses ethnic and linguistic boundaries and reminds us that the archaeologi¬ 
cal definition of a culture is based on only one segment of what really defines 
culture in a contemporary context. 

But the crux of the identity issue is thus (to reframe Rees and Livingood’s 
[this volume] simplification): is Plaquemine Mississippianized Coles Creek, is 
it a local historical outgrowth from Coles Creek, or is it the result of a new 
population that had minimal ties to populations living in the Coles Creek 
“heartland.” These issues permeate all of the chapters in this volume. On a 
larger scale these are the same issues that have bedeviled archaeologists study¬ 
ing Mississippian cultures since the late nineteenth century (Phillips 1970; 
Phillips et al. 1951; Smith 1984) and that allow us to recognize that a better 
understanding of Plaquemine contributes to a fuller comprehension of how 
later pre-Hispanic societies in the Southeast developed after a.d. 1000. 

The Mississippianized Coles Creek argument was the outgrowth of Jeff 
Brains work at Winterville and Lake George (Brain 1978,1989,1991; Williams 



202 


TRISTRAM R. KIDDER 


and Brain 1983). As presented by Brain, Plaquemine was the climactic out¬ 
come of Coles Creek peoples receiving the fruits of Mississippian knowledge 
and wisdom, evidently transported in a relatively small number of pots. Else¬ 
where, I have argued that Plaquemine is the outgrowth of indigenous Coles 
Creek populations (especially, one presumes, the elite) coalescing in response 
to external challenges and events (Kidder 1998b, 2002, 2004b). One key factor 
I have cited to argue for a largely indigenous origin for Plaquemine is the 
absence of “Mississippian” material culture traits outside of a limited number 
of sites in the Yazoo Basin. 

Some of the best data on exogamous contacts between Coles Creek people 
and their northern neighbors come out of the new and exciting work at Lake 
Providence (Wells and Weinstein, this volume). Here we have important con¬ 
texts rarely witnessed and a well-dated and precisely defined stratigraphic se¬ 
quence showing the development of this site (Weinstein 2005). The presence 
of abundant Mississippian material culture elements, many sourced directly 
to Cahokia, is hard to ignore. Wells and Weinstein, however, carefully (and, 
to my thinking, quite reasonably) avoid assigning causality to the Cahokia 
connection. Clearly, however, it is impossible to ignore this connection and 
these data provide an opportunity to rethink notions of external causality and 
internal historical processes. I suspect that we will find that the evidence in¬ 
creasingly points to a combination of causal factors leading to the transition 
from Coles Creek into Plaquemine. 

The Lake Providence data are all the more intriguing because that site is 
essentially fully contemporary with the later occupations at Raffman, located 
roughly 38 (straight-line) km to the west and south. Raffman, which is physi¬ 
cally larger and has more and bigger mounds than Lake Providence (Kidder 
2004a), has an entirely different ceramic assemblage in the period a.d. 1000- 
1200 (Roe, this volume). Despite considerable work at Raffman there is al¬ 
most no evidence of long-distance trade or exchange of any sort and certainly 
nothing like the abundance of data from Lake Providence. Subsistence data 
also indicate that Raffman and Lake Providence were very different. At Lake 
Providence there is considerable evidence that the site’s inhabitants were en¬ 
gaged in a maize-based subsistence economy while the contemporary popula¬ 
tion at Raffman was only occasionally using corn (Roberts 2005; Trachtenberg 
1999). Roe suggests that at sites such as Raffman complexity of the sort ex¬ 
pected for Plaquemine is already present in advance of maize agriculture, 
long-distance contacts, or the expansion/expression of Plaquemine cultural 
identity (see also Kidder 2004a). These two sites emphasize as we have never 
seen before the existence of extensive cultural variability (at least as measured 



CONTEMPLATING PLAQUEMINE CULTURE 


203 


by ceramics and other material culture traits) at the time of the “transition” 
to Plaquemine. How we understand these issues has yet to be resolved, but 
the work presented in this volume is a first step to appreciating such variability. 

We also should be cognizant of the evidence for both western and eastern 
long-distance contacts circa a.d. 1000 - 1200 . One can make an argument that 
the east-west axis from Moundville to the Great Bend of the Red River is just 
as important for the movement of trade items (especially prestige goods) as a 
north-south axis descending from Cahokia (Brain and Phillips 1996; Kidder 
1998c; Steponaitis et al. 1996). Taken in concert, these data emphasize again 
that events in the LMY are not occurring in a vacuum; understanding Plaque¬ 
mine requires a pan-southeastern perspective. 

Ian Brown (this volume) advocates a slightly different view of the transi¬ 
tion to Plaquemine, suggesting that the evidence for the long-assumed conti¬ 
nuity (cultural and perhaps biological) from Coles Creek to Plaquemine may 
not be as strong as it is generally thought. His model argues that the Plaque¬ 
mine folk of the Natchez Bluffs region may be derived from a migrant popu¬ 
lation presumably from more northern (but not that far north) regions. To my 
view the data are not clear on the issue of population origins and I am more 
inclined to see continuity. However, this work provides an important perspec¬ 
tive that cannot be ignored. We know that historic populations moved and it 
is not unreasonable to see precontact groups moving about as well. 

Brown’s hypothesis further emphasizes the remarkable variability that ex¬ 
ists within the Plaquemine “world” (or perhaps it really emphasizes differ¬ 
ences among archaeologists working on Plaquemine issues). Brown’s data de¬ 
rive from the Natchez Bluffs region, which is directly across the Mississippi 
River from a series of major sites (e.g., Osceola, Routh, Fitzhugh, Raffman, 
Lake Providence) that have been argued to demonstrate convincing evidence 
of continuity from Coles Creek into Plaquemine (Hally 1972; Kidder 1998b, 
2002). At this point I would not be especially surprised to find these two 
adjacent areas had distinctly different political and perhaps even population 
histories. 

Brown’s chapter also introduces us to the complexity and subtlety of the 
emerging (existing?) political landscape. His hypothesis of shifting political 
capitals is one that merits attention and should be tested. It certainly fits ex¬ 
isting data from the LMV (Brown and Brain 1983) and elsewhere (Anderson 
1996b; Blitz 1999; Hally 1996; Scarry 1996). These concepts remind us that 
these people had distinct histories and these histories count when we examine 
the social, political, and cultural trajectories of Plaquemine “culture.” 

Additionally, Brown’s discussion serves to focus our attention on the tran- 



204

sition from Coles Creek. Here the question resolves itself in the following 
form: How simple was Coles Creek? This argument is critical for modeling 
Plaquemine as an exceptional departure from what had come before. As noted 
by Roe (this volume) and Jeter (this volume), recent research suggests that 
Coles Creek leaders had the capacity to mobilize labor and to direct it in 
specific and seemingly complex ways before about a.d. iooo. In fact, if we 
emphasize earth moving and mound construction as a key attribute of com¬ 
plexity and a significant manifestation of the emergence of permanent, cen¬ 
tralized leadership, one might locate the source of Mississippian emergence in 
Coles Creek times rather than at a.d. 1100-1200 (Kidder 2002, 2004a, 2004b). 
Some characteristics that traditionally define Mississippi period societies (e.g., 
large mound sites constructed around an open plaza, hierarchical settlement 
patterns) are present at sites such as Pritchard Landing, Raffman, and Osceola 
in advance of Plaquemine hallmarks such as shell-tempered or Addis pottery. 

Assuming for a moment that Coles Creek is perhaps more complex than 
we sometimes think and that Brown’s porridge is, as he suggests, simmering 
by a.d. 1000, then perhaps it is time we consider situating the presence of 
long-distance trade goods in the context of how different communities were 
jockeying or contending for power. One of the major and incontrovertible 
shifts in the Tensas Basin of northeast Louisiana in the period circa a.d. 1150- 
1250 is a movement from more interior locations toward those situated along 
the Mississippi River. Raffman, Mott, and Pritchard Landing are all in decline 
(for lack of a better term) by a.d. 1200 while Transylvania, Fitzhugh, and 
Routh are in ascendancy (Kidder 2002). Lake Providence at circa a.d. 1150- 
1200 was a minor center, all things considered. Could the elites of this mi¬ 
nor center have been trying to leverage Lake Providence’s location on the 
river in an attempt to increase its political and social prestige—especially at 
the expense of its more interior and evidently less cosmopolitan neighbors? 
In contrast, could Lake George, located in the interior, be manipulating long¬ 
distance trade goods to capture power from Winterville and Mayersville, 
which were located on the river? While such scenarios are wholly hypothetical 
they do suggest that we place long-distance trade in a context of local political 
and social behavior and that we assume the local populations were actively 
engaged in defining themselves. These issues also suggest that we should keep 
in mind the significance of the shifting physical geography of the Mississippi 
Valley and its (potential) impact on the cultural and political landscape. 

In sum, cultural changes in Plaquemine times (e.g., bigger mound groups 
arranged in a hierarchical settlement pattern, increasing emphasis on maize, 
greater material culture diversity) were occurring throughout the LMV and 



CONTEMPLATING PLAQUEMINE CULTURE

can be recognized as historical trends dating prior to a.d. 1000 . To me, the 
major architectural and material culture changes in the Mississippi period 
have clearly local Coles Creek antecedents. There is no doubt that people liv¬ 
ing in the LMY, especially those in the northern range of the region, were 
feeling the economic, political, and possibly religious influence of Mississip¬ 
pi cultures from the north and east. I suspect that local elites were mobiliz¬ 
ing contacts with populations and polities beyond the LMV as part of a 
strategy to enhance or solidify their political and social position. Unspecified 
Mississippian influences, however, cannot account for the significant changes 
taking place in the Mississippi Valley after a.d. 1000 . Perhaps because of the 
rich resources of the region, and in contrast to other parts of the Mississippi 
Valley, overt warfare and hostility were not elements constraining social and 
settlement organization. We know from ethnohistoric documents, however, 
that armed conflict and interpersonal competition were important elements 
of the social and political landscape. Plaquemine groups in all parts of the 
valley and along its fringes exhibited a high degree of variability and differen¬ 
tiation. Our research in the future should not ignore this pattern. 

After a.d. 1200 local (and recently arrived?) populations continued to refine 
their adaptation to the rich resources of the region while selectively adding 
new technologies and concepts to existing cultural systems. Political centrali¬ 
zation in the Mississippi period was an outgrowth of competition among and 
between individuals and communities in Coles Creek times. These political 
shifts were likely enhanced or encouraged by external contacts and opportu¬ 
nities. What changes after a.d. 1200 is the scale of events, not their underlying 
structure. Can the origins and perpetuation of Plaquemine be both endo¬ 
genous and exogenous? The essays in this volume suggest the answer is yes. 
These studies demonstrate that the culture we know as Plaquemine is far more 
complex, varied, and nuanced than we have traditionally believed. The chal¬ 
lenge now is to take these ideas and to test them against the archaeologi¬ 
cal data.

ARCHAEOLOGY/ANTHROPOLOGY 


PLAQUEMINE 

ARCHAEOLOGY 



Edited by Mark A. Rees and Patrick C. Livingood 
With a Preface by Stephen Williams _ 



Plaquemine, Louisian*, about 10 miles south of Baton Rouge on the banks of the Mississippi 
River, seems an unassuming southern community for which to designate an entire culture. 
Archaeological research conducted in the region between 1938 and 1941, however, revealed 
distinctive cultural materials that provided the basis for distinguishing a unique cultural 
manifestation in the Lower Mississippi Valley. Ptaqmmin* Arch otology brings together 
eleven leading scholars who map a clearer understanding of Plaquemine culture and its 
relationship to other Native American societies. The authors provide a thorough, focused 
review of previous research, recent revelations, and directions for future research. They 
present pertinent new data on cultural variability and connections in the LowerMississippi 
Valley and interpret the implications for similar cultures and cultural relationships. This 
volume incontrovertibly demonstrates the accomplishments and importance of Plaquemine 
peoples in the long history of native North America.
