July 30, 2007 



WWC identified 69 
studies of 32 programs 
and practices 




8 studies 
met evidence 
standards with 
reservations 




English language learners are students with a primary language 
other than English who have a limited range of speaking, reading, 
writing, and listening skills in English. English language learners 
also include students identified and determined by their school 
as having limited English proficiency and a language other than 
English spoken in the home. 

This review focuses on programs to improve the English 
language literacy and/or academic achievement of elementary 
school students who are English language learners. For a 
program to be included, the majority of instruction has to be 
conducted in English (approximately 80%) but teachers might 
occasionally provide some native language support. The review 
focuses on programs for English language learners in grades 
K-6. It also includes studies in which students may no longer be 
considered to have limited English proficiency by their school but 
still have limited English language skills. 

We looked at 73 studies of 32 programs that qualified for our 
review. Of these, 16 studies of 12 programs met our evidence 
standards— 8 without reservations, and 8 with reservations. 



Twenty programs reviewed had no studies meeting WWC 
evidence screens, three of which were eligible for inclusion 
in this topic review but did not have studies. Additionally, 20 
studies could not be categorized by an intervention and are not 
cited in the report.'' (The initial identification of eligible programs, 
practices, and studies ended in March 2006). 

The review focused on three outcome domains: reading 
achievement, mathematics achievement, and English language 
development. 

In looking at the three outcome domains for the 12 interven- 
tions, the following produced potentially positive effects on 
reading achievement and English language development: 

• Bilingual Cooperative Integrated Reading and Composition 

• Instructional Conversations and Literature Logs 

• Vocabulary Improvement Program 

Eight other programs and practices had potentially positive 
effects in one domain. One program had no discernible effects in 
two domains (see the WWC Intervention Rating Scheme) . 



This review summarizes the first 
wave of intervention reports 
produced in 2005-06. 

www.whatworks.ed.aov 1. Four additional studies use single-case designs and are still under review. The WWC is currently developing standards for the review of single-case studies.

Intervention ratings for English language learners 

Each English language learning program that had at least one study meeting in the intervention and comparison conditions, and the consistency in findings 

WWC standards with or without reservations received a rating of effectiveness in across studies. 

at least one outcome domain: reading achievement, mathematics achievement. The research evidence can be rated as positive, potentially positive, mixed, no 

and English language development. The rating aims to characterize the evidence discernible effects, potentially negative, or negative. Table 1 shows the effective- 
in a given domain, taking into account the quality of the research design, the sta- ness ratings for the 12 programs and practices in the three domains (empty cells

Note: The Extent of Evidence Categorization, developed to tell readers how much evidence was available to determine the intervention rating for each study, is in Appendix A1 . Three programs had research findings in two domains, and eight 
programs had research findings in one domain. No programs had research findings in fhe mathemafics achievement domain. WWC intervention reports describe each program and provide information on the students, the cost, and 
the scope of use. To view the intervention reports, please click on the program name or go to www.whatworks.ed.aov . Following each program name is the developer's website address. The evaluated research addresses some but 
not all grade levels targeted by these Interventions. Grade levels are related to student age and may affect outcomes. For a comparison of targeted grade levels and grade levels in the studies reviewed by the WWC, see Appendix A2.

Average improvement indices for each domain 

The WWC computes an improvement index for each individual finding. In addition, 
within each outcome domain, the WWC computes an average improvement index 
for each study as well as an average improvement index across studies (see 
Technical Details of WWC-Conducted Computations) . 

The improvement index represents the difference between the percentile rank 
of the average student in the intervention condition and the percentile rank of the 
average student in the comparison condition. The improvement index can take on 
values between -50 and +50, with positive numbers denoting results favorable to 
the intervention group. Unlike the rating of effectiveness, which is based on four 
factors, the improvement index is based only on the size of the difference between 
the intervention and the comparison conditions. 

Reading achievement 

The reading achievement domain consists of student literacy outcomes includ- 
ing phonemic awareness, phonics, reading fluency, vocabulary, and reading 
comprehension. The vocabulary measures included in the reading achievement 
domain consist only of measures that deal with the ability to define or use words 
that appear in text the student reads. We reviewed outcomes in this domain for

10 English language learning programs, and the average improvement index 
ranged from 0 to +29 percentile points (figure 1). 

Mathematics achievement 

The mathematics achievement domain includes measures of content knowledge 
(number sense, properties, and operations; measurement; geometry and spatial 
sense; data analysis, statistics, and probability; and algebra and functions) as well 
as an understanding of mathematical concepts, procedures, and problem solving. 
Mathematics instruction involves the use of language, and thus we are interested 
in effective methods for teaching mathematics to students with limited proficiency 
with the English language. In this topic review, no studies that met WWC evidence 
standards with or without reservations addressed mathematics achievement. 

Engiish language development 

The English language development domain consists of oral or written proficiency 
outcomes including measures of listening comprehension, receptive vocabulary, 
grammar, syntax, and other linguistic features of the English language. The vocab- 
ulary associated with English language development relate to either expressive or 
receptive language in testing situations with no text to be read. We reviewed out- 
comes in this domain for eight English language learning programs and practices, 
and the average improvement index ranged from -1 to +31 (figure 2).

1 . According to WWC criteria, if a program finds a stafisfically significanf effect, there is less than a 5% chance that this difference is due to chance. The level of statistical significance was calculated by the WWC and, where necessary, 
corrects for clustering within classrooms or schools, and for multiple comparisons. For an explanation about the clustering correction, see the WWC Tutorial on Mismatch . For the formulas the WWC used to calculate the statistical 
significance, see the Technical Details of WWC-Conducted Computations . 

2. For rating purposes, the WWC considered the statistical significance of the findings and the magnitude of the effect, also called the effect size. An average effect size is the sum of all the effect sizes of the student outcomes in a study in 
a single domain divided by the number of those outcomes. The WWC considers an average effect size across all student outcomes in one study in a given domain to be substantively important if it is equal to or greater than 0.25. 

3. In this topic review, no studies that met WWC evidence standards with or without reservations addressed mathematics achievement. 

4. No studies showed statistically significant or substantively important negative findings in the domain. For a detailed description of the outcome measures, see Appendix A2 in the WWC intervention report at www.whatworks.ed.aov .

Appendix A4 
Methodology 



WWC Topic Report 



Seventy-three studies, which provided data on 32 Engiish 
ianguage learning interventions, were ciassified for the strength 
of their design. To be fuiiy reviewed, a study had to be a random- 
ized controlled trial or a quasi-experimental design with evidence 
of equating between treatment and comparison groups. Twenty 
studies could not be categorized by an intervention, and are not 
cited in the report. 

Eligibility for review 

Quasi-experiments eiigibie for review include those equating 
through matching or statistical adjustment, regression disconti- 
nuity designs, and singie case designs. Aithough singie case 
designs were identified for the Engiish ianguage iearning review, 
they were not included in intervention reports as we are currently 
developing evidence standards for regression discontinuity 
designs and singie case designs. 

The review considered the properties of measurement instru- 
ments, the percentage of students, ciassrooms, or schoois in the 
study sampie that were not inciuded in the reported resuits, and 
any sample characteristics or events that might serve as aiterna- 
tive explanations for the observed effect. For detaiis please 
see the WWC Evidence Standards . Long-term outcomes were 
preferred over immediate outcomes for inclusion in our anaiysis 
of program effects. 

The research evidence for programs and practices that have 
at ieast one study meeting WWC evidence standards with 
or without reservations is summarized in individual interven- 
tion reports posted on the WWC website. See http://www. 
whatworks.ed.gov . So far, 16 unique or independent studies of 
12 English language learning interventions have met evidence 
standards with or without reservations. The lack of evidence 
for the remaining programs and practices does not mean that 
those programs and practices are ineffective; some programs 
and practices have not yet been studied using a study design 
that permits the WWC to draw any conclusions about their 
effectiveness. And for some studies, not enough data were 
reported (such as descriptive statistics of the findings) to 



English Language Learners 



enable us to confirm statistical findings, so they were not fully 
reviewed. 

Rating of effectiveness 

Each English language learning program that had at least one 
study meeting WWC standards received a rating of effectiveness 
in at least one outcome domain; the rating of effectiveness aims 
to characterize the existing evidence base in a given domain. 

The intervention’s effect based on the research evidence can 
be rated as positive, potentially positive, mixed, no discernible 
effects, potentially negative, or negative. 

The rating of effectiveness takes into account four factors: the 
quality of the research design, the statistical significance of the 
findings, the size of the difference between participants in the 
intervention and the comparison conditions, and the consistency 
in findings across studies (see the WWC Intervention Rating 
Scheme) . 

The level of statistical significance was reported by the study 
authors or, where necessary, calculated by the WWC to correct 
for clustering within classrooms or schools and for multiple com- 
parisons. Because of these corrections, the level of statistical 
significance as calculated by the WWC may differ from the one 
originally reported by the study authors. For an explanation, see 
the WWC Tutorial on Mismatch . For the formulas that we used to 
calculate statistical significance, see Technical Details of WWC- 
Conducted Computations . If the average effect size across all 
outcomes in one study in a single domain is at least 0.25, it is 
considered substantively important, contributing toward the rat- 
ing of effectiveness. See the technical appendices of the English 
language learning intervention report for further details. 

Extent of evidence 

The WWC categorizes the extent of evidence in each domain as 
small or moderate to large (see the What Works Clearinghouse 
Extent of Evidence Categorization SchemeL The extent of 
evidence takes into account the number of studies and the

WWC Topic Report 



total sample size across the studies that met WWC evidence 
standards with or without reservations.'' 

Improvement index 

The WWC computed an improvement index for each individual 
finding. In addition, within each outcome domain, the WWC 
computes an average improvement index for each domain and 
each study as well as a domain average improvement index 
across studies of the same intervention (see the Technical 



Details of WWC-Conducted Computations^ . The improvement 
index represents the difference between the percentile rank of 
the average student in the intervention condition and the percen- 
tile rank of the average student in the comparison condition. The 
improvement index can take on values between -50 and +50, 
with positive numbers denoting results favorable to the interven- 
tion group. Unlike the rating of effectiveness, the improvement 
index is based only on the size of the difference between the 
intervention and the comparison conditions. 



1. The Extent of Evidence Categorization was developed to tell readers how much evidence was used to determine the intervention rating, focusing on the 
number and size of studies. Additional factors associated with a related concept, external validity— such as the students’ demographics and the types 
of settings in which studies took place— are not taken into account for the categorization.

1. This program is sometimes known as Direct Instruction using the Reading Mastery texts or SRA Direct Instruction— Reading Mastery. 

2. The study did not use a comparison group. 

3. Lack of evidence for baseline equivalence: the study, which used a quasi-experimental design, did not establish that the comparison group was equiva- 
lent to the intervention group at baseline. 

4. Confound: there was only one school in one study condition and two in the other, so in the analysis it was difficult to separate the effects of the interven- 
tion from the effects of the school. 

5. The sample is not appropriate to this review: data were not disaggregated, so the WWC could not examine the results for the sample that is relevant to 
this review. 

6. The study had only qualitative data. 

7. The comparison group was inappropriate to the focus of the review: students in the intervention group were in ESL and bilingual classrooms, and 
students in the control group were not in classrooms designated for ESL or bilingual students. 

8. The outcome measures are not relevant to this review. 

9. The sample is not appropriate to this review. 

10. Confound: there was only one teacher in each study condition, so the analysis could not separate the effects of the intervention from the effects of the teacher. 

11. Incomparable groups: the intervention and comparison groups cannot be considered equivalent. 

12. Confound: there was only one teacher in both study conditions, so the analysis could not separate the effects of the intervention from the effects of the teacher. 

13. Complete data were not reported: the WWC could not compute effect sizes. 

14. The effects of two interventions were studied: the WWC could not examine the results for the intervention that is relevant to this review. 

15. Confound: the analysis could not separate the effects of the intervention from the effects of the school. 

16. Incomparable groups: the language of instruction differed between groups. 

17. Incomparable groups: there were differences in the amount of native language used. 

18. For studies in which outcomes of the intervention appropriate to this review were examined, two had confounds, in which there was one school in one of 
the study conditions (Arizona) or one school in each study condition (Francis Scott Key), so the analysis could not separate the effects of the interven- 
tion from the effects of the school. Complete data were not reported in one study (El Vista), so the WWC could not calculate effect sizes.
