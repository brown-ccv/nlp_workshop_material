PREFACE 



A report by the Population Reference Bureau, Inc. on "America's Minorities - The Demographics 
of Diversity," predicts that half the school population In the United States will be made up of 
ethnic minorltes early in the twenty-first century. Already the four largest groups - African 
Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanlcs and Native Americans make up a third of the school-age 
population. It, therefore, seemed appropriate to acknowledge the efforts of authors in this 
population. 

This bibliography of fiction and nonfictlon books was drawn from standard reviewing documents 
and other sources including on-line sources. It was prepared to give users an Idea of the kinds of 
materials available. It Is not meant to represent all titles or all formats which relate to the 
literature by authors of nonEuropean heritage writing In the United Staces in English or whose 
writing has been translated Into English. While we have consulted our sources carefully and have 
endeavored to eliminate authors not members of the designated ethnic group, and members of the 
designated group who are from Canada, Mexico, Central and South America or from Africa or Asia, 
we acknowledge the probability of errors In this bibliography and beg the user's pardon In such 
cases. We have also included collections of literature and folklore even If collected by persons not 
members of the designated group when the literature Itself was all or partly by ethnic authors 
and If that folklore was developed In what Is now the United States or has received major 
modification in that area. Presence of a title 1n the bibliography does not Imply 
advocacy by the Department of Education. 

The bibliography is divided Into sections by the four major ethnic groups, African American, 
Asian American, Hispanic American and Native American. Each section Is In classed order, that 
is, In the order materials might appear on the shelves of a library. Numbers assigned are from 
the Dewey Decimal system and are approximations of call numbers which might be assigned In a 
library or library media center. Fiction books are labeled with an "F" and Easy books for lower 
elementary and preschool are labeled with an "E". Entries give author where pertinent, title, 
publisher if known, and annotation. Most materials Included were In print at the time the 
bibliography was prepared. Those known to be out of print are marked o.p. Publisher's address 
Is given when known for companies not Included In BOOKS IN PRINT. IL Introduces the Interest 
Level when known or estimated. Abbreviations for ethnic groups will be explained In the 
appropriate section.

ASIAN AMERICAN LITERATURE 



Section Introduction 

This section of the bibliography covers literature by authors of Chinese, Hawaiian, 
Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, East Indian and other Asian ancestry who are or were U. 
S. citizens or long-term residents. We have not made any distinction between first 
generation Immigrants and descendants of whatever subsequent generation. As specific a 
designation of ethnic group is given as possible. We acknowledge that sometimes our 
knowledge or that of our sources may have been Incomplete so that we no doubt have sins 
of omission and commission. We acknowledge that there are many ethnic groups covered 
by rather broad designations, but It seemed Important to encourage users to learn of the 
literary efforts of some Asian Americans. While our primary purpose Is to serve 
elementary and secondary schools and we have designated grade levels when reviews 
and/ or other sources indicated them, we do not assume those grade levels are definitive 
or complete. When an author was not designated or was too multiple to acknowledge, we 
have used abbreviations to reinforce that this section of the bibliography deals with 
Asian American authors. Those abbreviations include AS (Asian American), HAW 
(Hawaiian American), CA (Chinese American), JA (Japanese American), SA (South 
Asian American which Includes India), and V (Southeast Asian American). Among the 
sources used to Identify possible authors, titles and annotations for this component of 
our bibliography are ASIAN AMERICAN BOOKS, 1 993 Catalog of the JACP, Inc.; and 
ASIAN AMERICAN LITERATURE: AN ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY, edited by King-Kok 
Cheung and Stan Yogi (Modern Lang, 1988).
