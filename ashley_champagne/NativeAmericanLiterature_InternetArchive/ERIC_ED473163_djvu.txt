ABSTRACT 



The purpose of this research was to assess and analyze the 
frequency and trends of multicultural counseling articles in thirteen 
journals published by the American Counseling Association (ACA) from 1980 to 
1996, with specific focus on four racial and ethnic groups prevalent in the 
United States: African American, Asian American, Latino, and Native American. 
The results of the research show that all thirteen journals published 
articles on racial and ethnic groups; however, the greatest number of these 
articles were published by the "Journal of Counseling and Development" and 
the "Journal of Multicultural Counseling and Development." The majority of 
these articles dealt with racial and ethnic groups in general, followed by 
articles with specific focus on African Americans. Less attention was given 
to Latinos, Native Americans, and Asian Americans. There was a balance 
between empirical and nonempirical contributions. The subject focus of all 
the articles concentrated mainly on counselor training issues. (Contains 24

Analysis of Multicultural Counseling 
Articles Published

ABSTRACT 



The purpose of this research was to assess and analyze the frequency and trends of 
multicultural counseling articles in thirteen journals published by the American Counseling 
Association (AC A) from 1980 to 1996, with specific focus on four racial and ethnic groups 
prevalent in the United States: African American, Asian American, Latino, and Native American. 

The results of this research show that all thirteen journals published articles on racial and 
ethnic groups; however, the greatest numbers of these articles were published by the Journal of 
Counseling and Development and the Journal of Multicultural Counseling and Development. 
The majority of the articles dealt with racial and ethnic groups in general, followed by articles 
with specific focus on African Americans. Less attention was given to Latinos, Native 
Americans, and Asian Americans. There was a balance between empirical and nonempirical 
contributions. The subject focus of all the articles concentrated mainly on counselor training 
issues.

Introduction 

Multicultural counseling literature has increased enormously in the past 30 years. During 
the 1980s there was concern as to the amount and direction of the literature in journal articles. 
Some authors considered the field of multiculturalism to be in its infancy and that it lacked a 
clear identity and solid direction at a critical juncture (Heath, Neimeyer, & Pedersen, 1988; 
Ponterotto, Casas, Suzuki, & Alexander, 1995). The direction of change was not clear (Heath et 
al., 1988; Pedersen, 1985; Ponterotto, 1986; Ponterotto & Sabnani, 1989). In 1988, a Delphi poll 
on the future of multicultural counseling (Heath et al.) predicted an increase in training and 
preparation of practitioners, particularly in the number of counselor education programs 
incorporating skill development. The panel of experts also predicted an increase in areas related 
to theory and research, as well as an increase in publications related to Latinos, Asians, and 
African Americans, with Native Americans being the group least likely to be the focus of 
articles. A ranking of the journals most likely to publish multicultural counseling articles was 
obtained. The ranking was comprised from the nominations of experts in the field. The three 
highest-ranked journals were the Journal of Counseling Psychology, the Journal of Counseling 
and Development, and the Journal of Multicultural Counseling and Development. This poll 
constituted an important frame of reference for the future since it identified major trends in 
multicultural counseling and paved the way for changes where needs were identified. A later 
study by Perez, Constantine, and Gerard (2000) identified an increase in multicultural articles 
(12%) published in the Journal of Counseling Psychology (JCP) spanning 1988 until 1997. 

Ponterotto (1986) conducted a content analysis of the Journal of Multicultural 
Counseling and Development. His recommendations included more diversified articles on ethnic 
minorities, more special issues, particularly on career development, and a special focus on 




4 



Multicultural Articles 2 

individual ethnic minorities. Five years later, another study (Bennett, Rowe, & Hill, 1991) on 
the contents of the same journal yielded an increase in articles on minority personality 
development and research utilizing multivariate analysis. However, the authors observed that 
there was still a lack of ethnic representation among Asian Americans, Latinos, and Native 
Americans. A recent analysis including articles published in the Journal of Multicultural 
Counseling and Development between 1985 and 1999 (Pope-Davis, Ligiero, Liang, & 
Codrington, 2001) identified a continued need for articles focusing on Asian American and 
Latino counseling issues. Ernst and Ramirez (1994) conducted a similar study of the Journal of 
Mental Health Counseling during the first 10 years of publication (1979 -1988). Results 
indicated that minimal attention was given to minority groups and multiculturalism in general. 
Furthermore the literature consistently shows an imbalance, since most of the existing research 
studies published in scholarly journals were based on African Americans and to a lesser extent on 
Asian Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans (Leung, 1995; Ponterotto, 1986; Pope-Davis et 
al., 2001; Sue & Sue, 1990). 

Das (1995) noted that since the mid-1960s a substantial amount of literature dealing with 
the mental health needs of racial and ethnic groups has been published. This literature provides a 
useful base of knowledge for practitioners. Nonetheless, some experts in the field think that 
further research is needed, particularly in the areas of counselor education and training programs, 
counseling and mental health, and counseling process and practice (Ponterotto et al., 1995; Sue & 
Sue, 1999). There has been a call for more directed research that may, in turn, give the 
profession a better understanding of more appropriate counseling interventions specific to 
various ethnic groups (Sue & Sue, 1990,1999). Published reviews have been identified 
numerous multicultural publications pertaining to multicultural counseling issues (Atkinson & 



Multicultural Articles 3 

Lowe, 1995; Bennett et al., 1991; Ernst & Ramirez, 1994; Ponterotto, 1986; Ponterotto & 

Sabnani, 1989; Sue & Sue, 1990,1999). A large number of published books contain information 
with the aim of aiding practitioners in counseling ethnic minority groups (Aponte, Rivers, & 

Wohl, 1995; Paniagua, 1994; Pedersen, 1985, 1994; Ponterotto, et al., 1995; Sue & Sue, 1990, 

1999). However, authors (Bennett et al., 1991; Ernst & Ramirez, 1994; Essandoh, 1996; 
Holcomb-McCoy & Myers, 1999; Leung, 1995) continue to stress the need for more studies on 
minority personality development; career development; the effects of race and ethnicity on 
diagnosis, process, treatment, and outcome; multicultural counseling competencies; and 
professional issues and ethics. 

Currently, a major concern among counseling professionals is the amount and strength of 
empirical research regarding ethnic and racial groups: "After three and a half decades of research on 
cross-cultural issues in counseling, it seems appropriate to ask if there is empirical support for training 
more ethnic therapists, acquiring knowledge of ethnic cultures, and modifying traditional forms of 
treatment" (Atkinson & Lowe, 1995, p.389). Comprehensive definitions of multiculturalism have 
included information about race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and disabilities, to name a few. Sue 
(2001) stressed the need for a better balance for all “group identities related to culture” (p. 792) 
pertaining to race. When clinicians experience discomfort related to race issues and focus on other 
group differences “...race becomes less salient and allows us to avoid addressing problems of racial 
prejudice, racial discrimination, and systemic racial oppression” (Sue, p.792). The issue of empirical 
research and attention given to multicultural counseling, particularly to the four ethnic and racial 
groups prevalent in the United States, becomes even more important in view of the current cultural 
diversity in the United States and its projected increase. By 2005 the U.S. Census Bureau (2000) 
projects that 13.3 percent of the U.S. population will be Latino, 13.1 percent African American, 4.6

Multicultural Articles 4 

percent Asian American, and 0.9 percent Native American. By the year 2050 Latinos, African 
Americans, Asian Americans, and Native Americans are estimated to reach 24.3, 14.7, 9.3, and 1.1 
percent of the population, respectively. The largest increase in population is estimated to be among 
Latinos and Asian Americans. It is expected that by the year 2050 the Latino population will 
outnumber the nation’s combined number of African Americans, Asian Americans, and Native 
Americans (U.S. Census Bureau, 2000). 

In addition to the many authors from various disciplines who referred to the importance of 
multicultural competencies, professional associations have also increased their efforts toward 
reaching this purpose. The American Personnel and Guidance Association (APGA) was established in 
1952 and assumed its present name in 1992, the American Counseling Association (AC A). One 
identified goal of ACA is to promote organizational changes “to create an organizational structure 
that is more responsive to the multicultural and developmental needs of those counseling 
practitioners, researchers, educators, and students who play a pivotal role in the present and future 
mental health care system in the United States” (D’ Andrea & Daniels, 1995, p. 22). 

The Journal of Counseling and Development is the flagship journal of the ACA. One 
purpose of the ACA, through its divisions and their publications is to enhance professional identity. 
Divisions are organized around specific interest and practice areas to provide specialized knowledge. 
The Association for Multicultural Counseling and Development (AMCD), a division of ACA, was 
created to “improve cultural, ethnic and racial empathy and understanding by programs to advance 
and sustain personal growth” (American Counseling Association, 1997). 

Although the contents of the Journal of Multicultural Counseling and Development and 
the Journal of Counseling and Development were reviewed comprehensively (Bennett et al., 

1991; Ponterotto, 1986; Ponterotto & Sabnani, 1989; Pope-Davis et al., 2001), as well as the

Multicultural Articles 5 

contents of the Journal of Mental Health Counseling (Ernst & Ramirez, 1994; Streicher & 
Gerstein, 1994), ten other journals published by ACA have not been assessed solely on their 
multicultural content. These journals tend to have a specific focus that attracts specialized 
practitioners in mental health, school counseling, measurement and evaluation, family counseling 
therapy, and group work. 

The purpose of our analysis was to determine the inclusion of articles pertaining to racial 
and ethnic counseling issues within selected ACA journals over a 16-year period: A review of 
counseling articles addressing needs of other groups with diverse cultural identities was beyond 
the scope of this analysis and hence, was not included. Furthermore, the inclusion of articles on 
specific minority groups was assessed noting the empirical nature of the articles. Finally, this 
analysis evaluated whether the articles focused on vocational counseling, counselor training, or 
counseling techniques. 

Methodology 

This research analyzes the publication frequency of multicultural articles published in 
thirteen journals of the American Counseling Association (ACA) from July 1980 to June 1996, 
with particular focus placed on African Americans, Asian Americans, Latinos, and Native 
Americans. The thirteen journals reviewed were the following: Career Development Quarterly 
(CDQ), Counseling and Values (C & V), Counselor Education and Supervision ( CE & S), 
Elementary School Guidance and Counseling (ESG & C), The Family Journal: Counseling and 
Therapy for Couples and Families (FJ), The Journal for Specialists in Group Work (JSGW), 
Journal of Counseling and Development (JC & D), The Journal of Humanistic Education and 
Development (JHE & D), Journal of Mental Health Counseling (JMHC), Journal of 
Multicultural Counseling and Development (JMCD), Rehabilitation Counseling Bulletin ( RCB '),

Multicultural Articles 6 

Measurement and Evaluation in Counseling and Development (MEC & D), and School 
Counselor (SC). All of these journals were published prior to 1980, with the exception of The 
Family Journal: Counseling and Therapy for Couples and Families, which began publication in 
March 1993. 

Only full-length articles dealing with ethnic and racial groups were taken into 
consideration. The lead author, a Latina female, reviewed all articles to determine inclusion and 
categorizing for this analysis based on content pertaining to multicultural counseling issues. A 
reliability check by another rater was not included at the time of this analysis. Messages from 
presidents and editorial pages were excluded. A review of books or texts related to multicultural 
counseling was beyond the scope of this analysis and was not included. The subject focus of 
each article and whether the articles were of an empirical or nonempirical nature were analyzed. 
The articles were carefully tallied both by individual journal and by all thirteen journals to obtain 
the total number of multicultural articles published. They were also arbitrarily divided among 
four-year spans from July 1980 to June 1984, July 1984 to June 1988, July 1988 to June 1992, 
and July 1992 to June 1996, to provide a closer examination of any trends within the sixteen year 
period. Percentages were drawn from the numbers of articles obtained merely to facilitate the 
understanding of the data and for comparisons. 

For the purpose of this study, the articles were considered empirical when the authors 
dealt directly with a population and processed their information using statistical analysis. Case 
studies were also considered to be empirical. The remaining articles were considered to be 
nonempirical when the authors offered conclusions and suggestions based on nonstatistical 
studies.

Multicultural Articles 7 

This analysis defined articles that addressed multicultural counseling issues in a broad 
sense without being specifically focused on any one racial or ethnic group as “Ethnic and Racial 
Groups in General.” The remaining ethnic groupings were derived from the specific foci of the 
articles. For example, an article that addressed counseling issues of Latinos, African Americans 
and Whites was classified as “Latino, Af-Am, and White” (see Table 1). 

Regarding subject focus, articles about vocational issues were considered “career.” 
Specific treatment techniques were considered “counseling techniques.” Articles about ethnic 
and racial groups with nonempirical research contributing to the knowledge of practitioners due 
to their conclusions were considered “counselor training.” 

The data were then added individually per journal for the period July 1980 to June 1996. 
The total number of articles grouped by ethnic groups, research focus, and subject focus was 
separately tallied for all 13 journals, (see Tables 1-3). 

Results 



July 1980- June 1996 

Table 1 shows the overall number of multicultural articles of the thirteen ACA journals 
selected for this analysis. All journals published articles on multiculturalism, yielding a total of 
588. Predictably, the largest numbers of articles were consistently published by the Journal of 
Multicultural Counseling and Development (41%) and the Journal of Counseling and 
Development (20%). 

In general there is a good balance between empirical and nonempirical articles. From the 
period of July 1980 to June 1996 300 articles were empirical (51%) and 288 were nonempirical 
(49%) (see Table 1). 



Multicultural Articles 8 

Of the 588 articles written on multicultural ism from July 1980 to June 1996, 319 

focused on counselor training (54%), 159 were devoted to counseling techniques (27%) and 1 10 
were on career and vocational counseling (19%) (see Table 1). 

Racial and Ethnic Groups in General had the highest number of articles (299), 
representing 51% of all the articles (see Table 2). There were 145 articles (25%) written about 
African Americans; this group consistently received the highest attention after Racial and Ethnic 
Groups in General. Less attention was given to Native Americans with 43 articles (7%) and 
Latinos with 42 articles (7%). Asian Americans received the least attention with 21 articles 
published (4%). Twenty-two articles were devoted to comparison studies between African 
Americans and Whites, four articles compared Latinos and Whites, and five compared Asian 
Americans and Whites. Two articles were published in which African Americans, Native 
Americans, and Whites were used for comparison studies (see Table 2). 

An interesting trend can be observed in the overall publication pattern (see Table 3). 

There was a steady increase in the number of articles in general over 16 years. Also, during 
1992-1996 all of the journals included in this analysis published articles on multiculturalism. 

This increase attests to a heightened interest in multiculturalism. Furthermore, more articles 
were written on Racial and Ethnic Groups in General rather than on specific ethnic and racial 
groups. The majority of the articles examined counselor training (see Table 1). This pattern is 
encouraging because these articles are useful in assisting practitioners in becoming aware of the 
needs of ethnic and racial groups in general as well as issues in the field of multicultural 
counseling.

Counseling and Development, and School Counselor published articles on all the individual 
ethnic and racial groups from July 1980 to June 1996. However, the Journal of Multicultural 
Counseling and the Journal of Counseling and Development consistently published more articles 
on African Americans, Asian Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans (see Table 2). The 
other six ACA journals included in this analysis did not include articles on specific groups. 

Discussion 

Despite the fact that all journals published articles on diverse groups, there is a higher 
number of articles pertaining to ethnic and racial groups in general than on a specific group. 
African Americans received the most specific attention in the past 16 years with 145 articles 
(25%) written. In addition, 4% of the articles were based on comparison studies between African 
Americans and Whites, compared to only 0.9% of the articles comparing Asian Americans and 
Whites, and 0.7% comparing Latinos and Whites. There were no studies comparing Native 
Americans and Whites. 

The fact that 51% of the multicultural counseling articles analyzed concern ethnic and 
racial groups in general emphasizes the trend in the literature addressing multiculturalism issues 
in general. These articles supplied information to providers regarding more generic multicultural 
training, skill development, competencies, and general strategies for counselors. However, the 
number of articles written and published on specific groups (25% on African Americans, 4% on 
Asian Americans, 7% on Latinos, and 7% on Native Americans), compared with those of ethnic 
and racial groups in general (5 1 %), unfortunately remains limited and points to the need for more 
specific counseling focus with respect to specific ethnic and racial groups. 

In view of the projected increases in ethnic and racial populations in the United States by 
the year 2050 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2000), particularly among Latinos (24.3%), Asian Americans

(9.3%), and to a lesser degree Native Americans (1.1%), the paucity of articles written (7% on 
Latinos, 4% on Asian Americans, 7% on Native Americans) in relation to within-group 
differences is compelling. Ponterotto (1986) recommended an increased representation of 
diversified ethnic groups in the Journal of Multicultural Counseling and Development, calling 
for more special issues dedicated to Latinos and other ethnic and racial groups on particular 
subject areas. This analysis supports the identified need for increased attention towards effective 
strategies and information about counseling Latinos. Bennett et al., (1991) identified a need for 
broader representation of ethnic group inclusion. One main reason for the importance of more 
studies on specific minority groups is that it is important to recognize that African Americans, 
Latinos, Asian Americans, and Native Americans have unique cultures. Generalizing counseling 
techniques or counselor training without specific knowledge pertinent to different groups can 
limit counseling effectiveness. Several subgroups, for example, based on generational status, 
acculturation levels, and socio-economic status, as well as language differences, particularly 
among Asian Americans, exist (Paniagua, 1994). These within-group differences merit more 
specific studies in order to provide more effective counselor training and techniques. However 
minimal the publications, each journal consistently published articles on one or two ethnic and 
racial groups but gave no attention to the other two groups, which caused a disproportionate 
imbalance. All of the journals except The Family Journal, the Journal of Mental Health 
Counseling, and Rehabilitation Counseling Bulletin included articles on Native Americans. 
Counselor Education and Supervision and the Journal of Humanistic Education and 
Development did not publish any articles focused specifically on African Americans. Perhaps an 
increase in African American scholars within counselor education programs contributed to the 
increased proportion of articles with particular focus on African American counseling issues.

Multicultural Articles 1 1 

Conversely the lower number of articles with a Latino, Asian American, and Native American 
counseling focus might be attributed to fewer scholars representing particular groups. 

Another point worthy of attention was the inclusion of special issues on multiculturalism 
published in eight of the ACA journals. These special issues attest to the support of the 
counseling profession’s goal to promote cultural, ethnic, and racial sensitivity. 

Finally, this analysis could be enhanced with additional categorizing by at least one 
additional researcher. An expanded focus towards the counseling needs of other diverse groups, 
such as, Gay and Lesbians clients, is also needed. 

Conclusions and Recommendations 

This article sought to analyze the frequency of multicultural counseling articles in thirteen 
journals published by the ACA from July 1980 to June 1996. It is evident that the most attention 
was given to ethnic and racial groups in general. However, the number of articles focused on 
specific groups, with the exception of African Americans, were consistently low. In view of the 
projected population increases of Latinos and Asian Americans by the year 2050, along with 
predictions that these populations will tax more mental health providers, it is important for 
counseling journals to include a greater balance of articles on specific minorities, as well as to 
publish more research related to subgroup cultural differences and their commonalties. As found 
in the Delphi poll conducted by Heath et al., (1988), it was predicted that there would be an 
increase of 50% in the number of publications related to Latinos, a 25% increase in those related 
to Asians, and a 32% increase related to African Americans, with Native American publications 
remaining least likely to change. At this juncture more than 10 years later, this prediction seems 
to have been realized for African Americans (29%) and Native Americans (7%), but articles on 




14 



Multicultural Articles 12 

Latinos (7%) and Asian Americans (4%) published in the ACA journals have not reached the 
predicted percentages. More research is needed to better understand and rectify this trend. 

Perhaps the diverse journals of the ACA should solicit articles on specific populations. 

On a larger scale, the ACA might also promote, through its divisions, the importance of 
multiculturalism in the different areas of counseling services. Systematic assessments should 
also be conducted in different journals at regular time intervals survey their inclusion of various 
ethnic and racial groups. Additional attention can be devoted to within-group needs. 

Specifically, in the Latino culture, Mexican Americans, Cuban Americans, Puerto Ricans, 

Central and South Americans have much intracultural diversity. This could be better addressed 
with focused attention on various counseling issues for certain subgroups rather than an all- 
inclusive generalizing of Latino counseling needs. 

As the minority population continues to grow, coupled with socioeconomic changes and 
pressures, it is of paramount importance that counselors be sensitive and prepared to work with 
more populations effectively. Although books related to this subject are very useful, journals 
contribute greatly to the profession when practitioners need to access the most current 
information on specific areas. For this purpose journal articles should address counseling and 
relevant multicultural issues.
