Foreword 



As the third Samford Summer Writing Institute draws to a close, it is appropriate to 
reflect on the program's goals and achievements. The Samford University Writing Project 
was born out of the dream of Dr. David Roberts. The founder of two writing projects in 
the past, Dr. Roberts knew first hand the value of writing instruction. Peggy Swoger, a 
veteran writing project teacher, brought her classroom experience with writing to the 
institute. David and Peggy knew that teachers must find the power of self -expression 
within themselves in order to empower their students. 

During the two years following, almost fifty dedicated teachers have given five full 
weeks of their summer "vacation" to attend the summer institute. This is a testimony to the 
value they place on their profession and their students. They view writing as a means of 
encouraging diversity and critical thinking and as an instrument for building self-esteem 
within themselves and in the children whose lives they touch. 

These participants have become consultants for the Sanford University Writing and 
have presented workshops during the school year which were attended by nearly two 
hundred teachers from the Birmingham area as well as educators from all over the state. In 
this way, the influence of the writing project is being extended. 

The writing project wishes to thank Samford University, the Orlean Bullard Beeson 
School of Education, and the National Writing Project for their continuing support. The 
goal of the program has always been to enhance all areas of learning through writing. This 
goal is being realized by the support given to teachers committed to improving themselves 
so they can give more to the children they teach.

Goal Statement: 

In January, 1992, 1 "rushed in where angels fear to tread!" I was one of the last in 
our system to begin Writing Workshop, and I jumped in with both feet with just a tad 
more than a nodding acquaintance with Nancie Atwell. As inexperienced as I was, I 
discovered some very good things about my students. There were talents in my sixth 
graders that I had not seen in the previous eighteen weeks of school, even though we had 
done a lot of writing. That's when I decided I HAD to get into the SUWP to learn about 
Writing Workshop, how to set it up, and how to "nudge" my students and me toward 
being prolific AND proficient writers.

that when a teacher stops learning, that teacher stops teaching. I do not want to 
be that teacher.

Summary of Presentation: 

Richard Graves presented the works of a variety of authors and poets who related 
in their writings their own experiences with rivers. He captivated us with his own 
experiences with rivers throughout his life and then asked us to reach into our memories 
and write about our own. Many of us were amazed that using the reflective attitude 
modeled by Dr. Graves allowed us to discover river relationships we didn't know existed.

DAILY LOG 




June 10,1992 

This is gossip columnist Jo Rnr» Trenary reporting on the social event of the 
season. Writing Project members convened ot Somford University on May 9 
to discuss plans for the 5 weeks they will spend together analyzing their 
personal involvements with writing. Members of that group included such 
social standouts as Scott Barrentine, intellectual jock from Macfldiry High 
School, and Lara Hester, known for her involvement in People for the Ethical 
Treatment of Animals. Interesting that also a part of the group was Nina 
Elmer-Tucker. Vou remember her. She was the woman who went on thai for 
being responsible for the death of her deuoted cat. Lara end Nina together 
for 5 weeks? It could be very stimulating! I ll keep you all posted on any 
exciting developments. 

Rlso a part of the group were Sharon Powell, Canadian explorer, Pat 
Ulillett, witty, fairytale writer, orud feminist Jane-Marie Gray. Jane-Marie 
already has her recruitment sights on "marshmallow H Katherine Morris who is 
often easily manipulated by her own students. Cherokee Chief Dave may 
have his hands full with that combination. He might also have problems 
motivating Jeanne Dorset who enjoys her involvement in her favorite water 
sport, M lying on a raft in the summer sun." Joy Deming will take time away 
from her throughbreds to participate in the 5 week course. Diane Weber, in 
spite of the guilt she feels for being away from her own children, has also 
agreed to participate. Samford instructor David Dedo has agreed to bring his 
expertise in writing to the group as has Jeanne Rverhart, famous for her 
musical talents. Dorothy Ward, socialite from Hewitt Trussville, joined the 



ERLC

group "looking for answers." This group should be able to prouide the 
answers to a uariety of questions! 

Chief Daue Roberts flanked by Carol Dean, known for her organizational 
skills, discussed types of ' free-writing," characteristics of response groups, 
and group assignments to be completed by the neat meeting. Efforts were 
made to intermix the diuerse personalities present at this euent, and all 
seemed to go well; howeuer, 5 weeks of intermixing may produce less 
congenial results. Vou can bet that this columnist will be present at the next 
meeting, prepared to inform my public of any unusual happenings that might 
occur. Until then, this is Jo Ann Trenary, your link to the socially prominent in 
ths writing world, saying "adieu. 1

July 7, 1992 



I woke up this morning at 5:52 A.M. even though my alarm was set for 6:32 A.M. 
I should have known that this was going to be the start of a Terrible. Horrible. No Good. 
Very Bad Day ( I do apologize to Judith ViorstH) 

I started a load of laundry before I realized that I did not have any more quarters 
to dry the load. I think I'll run away to Alaska, j 

Determined that something good is going to happen, I decided to go jogging for the 
fourth time in my life. I actually managed to make it out of my apartment without 
anything happening. I must have jogged (okay I was only walking very fast) at least 2 
blocks when I realized that I had accidentally locked my keys in my car. I am definitely 
going to run away to Alaska!! 

Only the fact that I had to pick up Jeanne prevented me from heading to the 
airport immediately. I told myself that I could leave as soon as class was over. 

Things started to look better as soon as I spotted the bagels 
and strawberry cream cheese Lara had brought. I love strawberry 
cream cheese! Even Carol "Ansel Adams" Dean made me feel better 
by asking me to help her with her camera. It didn't even break. I 
glanced around the room, shell-shocked faces glared back at me. 
Well was this just a Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day for 
everybody? I sure hoped not. This was rny day to be in a bad mood 
and I didn't want to share it with anyone else. 

Jeanne A. set the tone for the day as she read her captain's log 
from yesterday. How did she know that we were going to be focusing 
on water? After she read her log we settled down to write in our 
journals. We were stimulated by the simulated soothing ocean 
sounds surfacing from the coffee pot. (How's that for a sentence?) 
Things were starting to settle down for me. I had avoided bad luck 
for over 30 minutes!!!! 

The different committees reported on their progress. We 
decided that response group #2 will host the potluck this week. The 
anthology committee asked everyone to turn in their resumes by 
Monday, July 13. The publicity committee met with Mary Wimberley 
from Information Services. It sounds like they know what they are 
doing. 

Dick Graves joined us as a guest presenter. Dr. Graves is from 
Auburn University and that's probably the only terrible, horrible, no 
good, very bad thing about him. He actually made my day into a 
Terrific, Happy, Not Bad, Very Good Day. He shared with us his 
passion for rivers. He helped us find our own passions, our own 
feelings about water. He lulled us with music, dazzled us with 
pictures, inspired us with poetry, and most importantly invited us to 
write. Pens and pencils flew as everyone eagerly took up his 
invitation. We then met in response groups and shared our writings. 
Everyone is so eager to help each other. We came back together in a 



34 

44 



large group where a few brave volunteers shared their pieces. I was 
stunned at the depth, the tears, and the memories that surfaced. 
This could easily turn into a philosophy class. I left for lunch 
bubbling over with thoughts and dreams. - 

After lunch we returned to discuss response groups. Everyone 
contributed ideas and suggestions on how to use response groups 
with students. Jo Ann emphasized the importance of the atmosphere 
of your classroom. We discussed the use of questions to help 
students focus on their writing. We also decided we wanted to 
start a good book file. 

It was then time for response groups. We shared pieces that 
we had started in May. I didn't want to stop talking. 

We ended the day with Dr. Roberts discussing our future 
classroom guests and giving us some reading assignments. 

I am now typing the log up in the lab. I have no idea if my laundry is still at the 
laundry mat. My feet have blisters from my excruciating run this morning. But my 
bags are not packed to go to Alaska. I think I have just found a new refuge.

SAMFORD UNIVERSITY WRITING PROJECT 
DAILY LOG 
July 8, 1992 

Yours truly, "keeper of the log" today, was fifteen minutes late and walked in during Dean 
Ash's (School of Education) morning welcome to the Writing Project participants! (Many 
Birmingham area residents can attest to the mess that is Route 280 during rush hours.) 
Fortunately, Jane-Marie's wonderful assortment of morning snacks allowed him to indulge 
in his usual response to stressful situations. 

The log from the previous day was read and approved (with minor revisions), and 
everyone (except the keeper of the log and Scott, who was out sick today) then settled 
down for some serious journal writing. 

Because the committees had no pressing agendas today, and only one response group 
required an anxiety attack concerning its pot-luck dinner, we had an early treat with the 
guest demonstration, trusting One Another in the Classroom," by Patricia Douglass of 
Thompson High School. Pat, in addition to being an obviously wonderful person, is also 
a very experienced and highly skilled English and Theater teacher. (And it doesn't hurt 
that she was a Workshop participant two summers ago.) The classroom activities she 
discussed are designed to "1) break down social and academic barriers, 2) generate 
empathy and self-esteem, and 3) supply a reason to-observe + listen + think + feel + create 
+ speak," which equals "learning about ourselves and our world 'from the inside out/" 

The two activities participants engaged in were "The Name Game" and the m I am' Poem," 
The Name Game, besides sharpening our ability to remember each others names, provided 
us with a classroom activity that can help to level students 1 social and academic "barriers." 
The "I am" poem certainly will help students to learn about themselves and their world 
"from the inside out." And, keeping with his "traffic jam mood," the keeper of the log 
produced a terribly morbid poem, which was also terrible! Thank goodness it was time for 
lunch and more stress response! 

The afternoon in the Mac lab was much better for the keeper of the log. He indulged in a 
favorite activity, answering simple computer questions, that makes him look like an expert. 
Most of the folks seemed to be busy cranking out their resumes, and those that the 
Anthology Committee collected looked very professional. 

The keeper of the log left the lab this afternoon happy, satisfied, and with no urge to eat!

Samford University Writing Project 
Log for July 9, 1992 



Good Morning all you listeners! This is SUWP RM 114 on your radio 
dial, coming to you daily from 8:30 to 4. This is DJ Dr. JD hoping 
you will stay tuned. 

The first item today is the refreshments of bagels with a choice of 
two flavors of cream cheese. Plus there is an assortment of 
vegetables with dip. The members of the writing workshop continue 
to eat well. All of this was delivered by our fearless program 
director Carol Dean. 

As we continue with the program, the early morning welcome is 
delivered by the "Dean of Deans," Provost Hull. Thank you Dr. Hull for 
helping us understand that what we are doing is important to 
more than just our classrooms. 

Next David Dedo ( who redeems himself by being on time today) 
reads the log for the previous day. Then without any prompting the 
good old SUWP listeners automatically turn to some serious journal 
writing. 

Early morning the station owner Dr. Roberts takes over the program 
to explain the reading assignment for the day. Thank goodness 
somebody understands that article. 

Late morning the arrival of the guest speaker arouses the interest 
of the participants. Karen Jean of Vestavia High School does not 
disappoint her listeners as she delivers the guest demonstration for 
the day. Karen explains several methods to help students learn about 
literature. Her explanation really hits home when she has her 
listeners explain the poem "January Chance," and some of us were 
not on the train. WOW! How enlightened we all will by the end of 
this program. 

The programs have been running over time all morning so we are 
behind schedule. Lunch was put off until nearly one. 

When we returned from lunch, our program director Carol Dean 
assigned us lab working time.

Daily Log or Writing A la Carte 

Memories of a less than savory evening with an Alabama 
State Trooper in Cullman County soon evaporated when I entered 
this morning into the Chez SUWP. The smell of coffee brewing and 
the sweet taste of coffee cakes were just the solace I needed, thanks 
to German Chef, Jeanne Averhart. 

At 8:30, the timely Maitre D Roberts greeted his diners in his 
usual smooth manner. Next, hostess Carol Dean presented a 
choice menu for the day. Afterwards, appetizer Joy Deming 
reported on the previous workshop in such a delicious way that our 
taste buds were whetted for the entree. The main course consisted 
of Karen Jean from Vestavia High School. She served succulent 
suggestions for getting seniors started in the writing workshop. And 
if that wasn't enough, Willis Jackson prepared for us well done tips 
on content area writing. He is a seasoned teacher from Ramsay 
Culinary School. In an essay assignment, concerns about racial 
strife, rising health costs, hopeless injustice, national debt, and 
educational priorities left us hungry for more. Willis promptly treated 
us to a selection of newspaper clippings garnished with facts. Willis 
reminded us that it's important to support your position with facts. 

After we were sated from feasting on quotes like JoAnn 
Trenary's, "Teachers should be paid more than football players," 
we met in response groups for dessert. Some of the best desserts 
will be sampled tomorrow by the entire group. After dinner cordials 
were served in the computer lab, during which demonstration dates 
were selected. All in all, the day's festivities were a gastronomic 
success. It's too bad Dorset and Ward couldn't partake. Ward did 
meet the deadline by rushing in her resume to the ruthless 
anthology committee before the main dining room closed. 

I have to rest now. I feel sluggish after eating so much. Now, I 
need to decide how I'm going to eat this 70 dollar speeding ticket.

8:05 a.m. ALL RIGHT! I may be FIVE-no, TEN--minutes early for

headed for Hwy 31 South. No such luck, however. Traffic had 
bottlenecked in Homewood since construction for the new-and- 
improved Homewood had started up once again. Orange and white 
barrels barricaded one lane right smack dab in the middle of all the 
traffic lights. I checked off my to-do list in my mind as I waited: 
Read my handouts; read my books; prepare music for my substitute 
who will play for me in church on Sunday; pull music for choir 
practice tonight; work on my compositions; direct choir practice; 
wash clothes for the workshop this weekend in Tuscaloosa; WRITE 
THIS LOG. ...WHEW! How am I going to get it all done? I silently 
whined as ! finally made it through Homewood onto Lakeshore. 

I walked into our classroom at 8:27. HA! Early again! (Please note it 
was still morning). Joy Deming's breakfast, lunch, and dinner bar 
awaited me. With a buffet of food to tranquilize my anxiety attack, 
I settled down to write in my journal as music played in the 
background. We then shared some haiku poetry. Why I shared my 
poem is beyond me. It was some trite piece about the beach. Instead 
of saying aHA..., the group was probably silently saying hmmmm (no 
brag, just fact). 

Next on the agenda were the committee meetings. JoAnn complained 
that her crew had not shown up to work on the anthology. (Members 
on her committee had volunteered to help with the scrapbook and had 
gone to that meeting, or, at least, somewhere else.) Scott Barrentine 
had the same problem, but he "met" anyway and reported that he had 
arranged for Channel 13 to visit during the last week of the 
institute (Pam Huff had better not show up for my demonstration!). 
Scott also said that there was a good chance Channel 42 could come, 
too~hopefully before Pam does. I worked with the administrative 
visits group, and we organized how we would handle follow-ups to 
the written invitations I had mailed. 

After a short break and more food from the breakfast, lunch, and 
dinner bar, Carol Dean presented a demonstration on writing across 
the curriculum. We wrote about thoughts and feelings we had had on 
the day the Berlin Wall fell and on the day the Persian Gulf War 
began. After discussing our experiences, Carol used these as a 
springboard for discussing Paul Revere and the Battle of Lexington

and Concord. After reading a short book about Paul Revere's famous 
ride, we then wrote journal entries that people who lived in his time 
might have written. Through her demonstration, Carol reminded us 
that history was far more than just dates. 

12:00 Break for lunch. We were on time! 

1:15. We met in response groups. 

2:00 Peggy Swoger visited and shared with us the importance of 
working with the community and with parents in enlisting their 
support for the reading and writing workshops. 

We then were dismissed to the computer labs to write, but I left my 
disk at home...Well--at least I was on time.

We were late getting started. Carol's group wouldn't heed her. 

"However," she said, "it's not the group leader." 

Pat brought a new ocean-sounds tape that she got. 

"But are we writing to a tape," asked Lara, "or just the coffee pot?" 

Peggy Swoger came to visit. In the student lounge she joined us, 
Where our readings we shared, ranging from grim to hilarious. 
We heard fish stories, fairy tales and poems not yet quite final, 
And of Jane-Marie's boots made of shiny white vinyl. 

We wrapped up the morning. In small groups we met, 
And got straight to work (although Carol's no threat). 
Discussed were our trials and the tricks of our trade 
And the many quirks each of us had teaching our grade. 

Afternoon was ?et aside for response groups to meet, 
Or to work in the computer lab and vrite something neat. 
Then off to Mt. Olive xo cook on the grill 
And eat as only SUWP members will.

The Royal Rostrum 



The twentieth of July in the year of nineteen hundred and ninety-two 

At 8:40 King David's Knights of the Round Table (actually it's a bunch 
of square tables) were summoned by Queen Carol Dean to commence 
writing in their royd^ journals. 

The knights snacked on a feast (one fit for a king) prepared by 
Princess Dorothy, while Lady Katherine read the log from the 
previous class meeting. 

Court jesters Dedo and Barrentine Chivalrously volunteered to 
come to the aid of a damsel in distress, Lady Mary Martha Rhodes, as 
they bravely carried crates of books for her. Lady Mary Martha , a 
representative from Literacy Education Resources, shared several 
texts she felt the knights could use to shield their students from 
boredom in the classroom and to arm them with great ideas as they 
continue their quest for excellence on the battlefield ( the 
classroom). 

Brave Princess Pat Willett led the round of presentations with 
her demonstration of theme writing. Princess Pat used music and 
photographs to inspire the knights to write about friends. The 
Birmingham City's middle school language arts specialist, (Queen) 
Dr. Sandra Harrell, courageously volunteered to share her piece about 
the characteristics she finds important in friends. Each knight 
courteously responded to Princess Pat's presentation ( I like 
alliteration) by scribing his or her recommendations and admirations 
in the form of personal letters to her . 

After a hearty lunch and a quick meeting around the round--l mean- 
tine square tables, the knights were dismissed to ride off into sunset 
(actually it was just to the computer lab) to dutifully work on his or 
her presentation or personal narrative.

Devil's advocate here, reporting on happenings in the SUWP. (It's appropriate for a 
devil's advocate to procrastinate, so it's most appropriate that I've composed this log on the 
morning of July 22!) Our sinful (that means delicious and fattening) snacks were provided 
this morning by Nina Elmer. After indulging, the group engaged in the usual thirty 
minute journal writing session. (Confidentially, some participants feel that being forced to 
listen to ocean sounds while journal writing must be punishment for some past sins!) 

After completing journal entries, the group, led by Carol Dean, had a profound discussion 
of how journals can be beneficial for both students and teachers. Following our short 
break (except for the devil's advocate, who only has LONG breaks), Joy Deming made a 
wonderful presentation on "Characterization." Using speeches of native Americans and 
having students (in this case the SUWP participants) write about their own family/ethnic 
backgrounds, Joy showed how the writing process can be incorporated in the teaching of 
literature and enrich both the students' reading and writing experiences. The last thirty 
minutes of the morning were used by the participants to write responses to Joy's 
presentation. (Curses! The devil's advocate can't find anything to criticize!) 

The afternoon was INTENDED for "Independent Reading, Writing and Research." 
(Participants: please consult your schedules!) The devil's advocate was pleased to see that 
no one was to be found in the Mac lab in the afternoon-you little devils!

Thank goodness it's Thursday! we hear several say 

As they saunter on in at the start of our day. 

I haven't got what it takes to match JoAnn's haiku 

But I'll make my log rhyme-which we'll have to make do. 

After journal writing in class to Jeanne's tape of sounds 
It was time for shared readings. We were off to the lounge. 
It was Dave's idea for the rules to be broken. 
We drank and we ate (Dave wished to be smokin'). 

Jeanne began with a poem. She worries about "her boys." 
What happened to their days of innocence and toys? 
Sharon told of an experience she had on the water 
It was merely a kayak, but life's what it taught her. 

We all had our time like Pat's "Dixie Deb" 

And Lara got us caught in a political web. 

Diane took us back. To her childhood we went 

To find out how those magical years had been spent. 

We turned serious a while. Dave "straddled the fence," 

Leaving a few of us behind, feeling rather dense. 

But Carol wrapped us up in the tale of her "dragon" 

Of course, we teach the right way. Our scores won't be laggin' 

After a break it was time for Jane-Marie's presentation 
She taught us how teachers could be rockin' the nation. 
Music videos no longer are every teacher's foe, 
But can benefit us all (well, those of us "in the know.")

Well, I had hoped to think of something truly creative for our log today. After recipes, 
poems (even haiku ), and a ship's log, surely there's something I can do. But the muses 
aren't singing, folks, and the well is bonr diy. Creative invention is-in other words-shot, 
kaPUT--/fm. So, you'll just have to settle for a regular, generic, and ordinary account of 
what happened at the SUWP on July 27, 1992. Regular, generic, and ordinary details 
follow.... 

8: 15 (or thereabcuts): Those who were present had coffee, assorted soft drinks, and Dave 
Dedo's wife's delicious pound cake. I believe something else was served, but I can't 
remember what it was because I didn't have any of it (I was trying to be good. Of course, I 
couldn't let the morning pass without having a small piece of cake.) 

8:40: I arrived while people began to write in their journals. I think the log had already 
been read The ten extra points Carol had given me last Thursday for being the last one to 
leave were probably lost at this point. (When I queried Carol about my status, she did say 
those points were on shaky ground.) 

9:00 Our committees met, and we gave brief summaries of deadlines for presentation 
write-ups and submissions to the anthology. 

10:00 Lara gave a demonstration of collaborative fiction writing. As part of our 
assignment, each group was given a small paper bag containing assorted items. Using 
these items, we created short stories. We wrote tales about elderly people, thieves, boy- 
girl fights, and King Mentholyptus (Yes, he was named after a Hall's cough drop.) 

11:45 Lunch break 

1:00 We reconvened for Jeanne's demonstration of "Reading Art" We drew pictures 
illustrating words such as rage and embarrassment and discussed why we chose to draw 
these words as we did Since we were all very artistic and were cognizant of all available 
artistic techniques, the analyses became quite deep. Jeanne also shared many resources she 
used to incorporate an appreciation of fine arts into her English classroom. After viewing 
many prints and art books, our final assignment was to write a poem about a painting of 
our choice. 

3:00 Response groups/computer time 

4:00 I'm outta here! ^

Directions for the Day: 

Start at Joy and Dorothy's Bagel and Muffin Factory located 
on the Samford University Campus. Don't forget to fill up! 
Next stop by Jane-Marie's log. It's one of a kind (or at 
least one of ten!) Quietly drive down Journal Drive, Don't 
get confused about directions, just remember to go the exact 
opposite of direction-deficit JoAnn, Now it's time to head 
to the gardens. Go East on Pat's Speedway. Be careful of 
any car being driven by "Look Ma, No Hands" Dorothy, Go 
through the Tanka Tunnel to Jeanne A's gazebo. You will pass 
Diane and Katherine's Cool, Shady, Refreshing Place on the 
right. It's across frcm the mall containing Scott's Bait and 
Tackle Shop featuring demonstration spear fishing, The Carol 
Ansel Adams Photography Studio, and Pat's Hat Shop, Don't 
forget to wander through the beautiful gardens. Stop at 
Nina's rock to kick your shoes off and dangle your feet in 
JoAnn's Lake of Deep Thoughts. (Hee Hee!) You could even 
float around on Jeanne D,'s raft, (That is if she is willing 
to share it!) Be careful of Lara's Trained Ant Farm, They 
are vicious. Don't forget the bargain sale at Katherine's 
Rock Quarry, Finally after lunch either make your way to the 
computer cave of despair or go find that note-writing 
librarian. 

Good Luck! ! 

Editor's Note: 

Dave Dedo must have gotten directions from JoAnn because he 
never even found the Samford Campus, Maybe he wound up at in 
the zoo! !

As I wended my way to the castle of Samford, I wondered what magical spells we 
novices of the rite of SUWP would learn this thirtieth day of the seventh month anno 
domini*. Being designated scribe for this mom (as I) was one of the special tests of 
apprenticeship to accomplish before we could leave the rigorous training and practice the 
wondrous skills learned that would bring back the curiosity to write in our children. 

When I arrived, I was wondcrstruck to see Dave, die wizard of SUWP. Our "faces 
on paper 19 had arrived. To remind us again of his tremendous power, on uttering a mystical 
incantation of 'no money, no picture', we willingly gave to him the money pieces to 
possess our own personal talisman of SUWP. 

After first sampling the tantalizing bread food called donuts with which the 
enchantress Trenary had us break fast and partake, we began with the Test Of Reading 
The Log prepared by the novice, Sharon The Storyteller. 

Our next challenge, directed by the handmaid to the rite of SUWP, Carol of Dean, 
was the Test Of Quiet journal Writing* This was done today without the conjuring 
of music to entrance our thoughts. Perhaps that is why The Dedo, that devilish advocate, 
felt compelled to enjoin the apprentices to take part in his rhetorical ideological argument on 
education . (The Dedo intrigues and fascinates us, moving as he does, between his strange 
worlds and protecting us from the control of barbarians.) We found much to take with us to 
Sharon's Pool of Deep Thoughts. 

Apprentice Barrentine (he of the princely looks) performed today 's Test Of The 
Proper Presentation by weaving an imaginative spell on love letters. We took part in 
decip hering the strange symbols and codes of the children we will teach (LYLAS, TLA, 
FFE) and transmitted friendly messages to those who were special to us. With these 
strengthened powers, we gathered into groups and tested the words to write what made 
sense by using the chant,* Whachadoinnotmuchhere'. Lara The Cheerleader and Hie Dedo 
translated the letters that each group had composed. (Earlier, the novice Lara had magically 
changed a common sheet of paper into a covering for a letter and had shared the secret with 
us.) 

We were granted time for an afternoon repast (Learning teaching magic is very 
exhausting!) 

When we eagerly began our afternoon, two great lords - Rick Lazenby, principal 
of Shades Valley, and his cohort of extensive vocabulary, John Booker - had come ftxftn 
the realm of the county to heed the words of Diane Of The Gifted, as she, too, completed 
her Test Of The Proper Presentation* To us she gave us the spell of having students 
find meaning in their writing by observing the simple foods of potatoes and pears. We 
again entered the mysterious letters which form words onto our paper and learned they 
were called a double entry journal. Our guests joined with us as we explored how words 
gain meaning from what is written before and later. (With such lesson experiences as these, 
it will not be long before our children students will be in awe and murmur respectfully, 
"opusculum paedagogum", when we pass them by.) 

It is a daily task for we apprentices to remove to the turret to complete our 
preparations for our final challenges of endurance, the Test Of The Position Paper 
and the Test Of The Portfolio* (These require much strength of resolution.) We had 
been admonished by Carol of Dean that we have a great deal to do to end our obligations of 
apprenticeship Here we spent the remaining hours practicing the tapping of the fingers 
upon the mystical computers* 

Now the sun has moved to hover over the roofs of the castle grounds as I pen these 
last letters and return to my village home.

Simply delicious delicacies prepared by Pat Willett were served. 

Attention directed to "Devil's Advocate Dedo M who needs our disks overnight. 

Mv ! Can we trust him? 

Forget? About anthology due date? Leader Carol reminds us. 

Oh, we have so little time left to compute our work! 

Really Carol! What did you do to this coffee? 

Do you expect us to drink it AND listen to the week's schedule? 

Well, Pat "The Celtic Woman Who Strews Berries" Willett read her fairy tale log. 
Ready for QUIET journal time? - NOT! ! 
It hasn't happened since week # two. 

Teacher Dr. Roberts arrives to discuss "What It Means To Be A Teacher/Consultant". 
It involves two approaches: school site workshops and Samford campus workshops. 
Now 45 teachers are involved in these five three-hour workshops. 
Gracious students Dorothy W. and Diane W. agreed to be co-editors of SUWP newsletter. 

Presentation time for Katherine "I'm lookin' cute in my hot polka dot dress" Morris. 

Really neat lesson on Animal Farm -- news reporting style! 

Oh , wonderful day! It's lunch time! 

Just in time (after lunch) for the next presentation of the day. 

Excellent lesson by Dorothy "I'm lookm' especially nice today in my green dress" Ward.

0:30 Where's Scott? Who needs a tape of soothing ocean noises 
when one is surrounded by rumbling and gurgling stomachs. I wonder 
how many times the word FOOD appears in the journals this 
morning? 



9:00 Where's Scott? Where's the FOOD? Where's Scott's response 
group? I have looked everywhere for the familiar red and white 
stripe shirt. No one has seen it anywhere. "Maybe he's in France 
buying fresh croissants," Diane suggest. We drag our weak bodies 
over to our response groups. Our paradigm has shifted in the writing 
project today whether we like it or not. Writing without FOOD. 
Discussing without FOOD. I'm starting to feel a little faint. I grab 
hold of the empty simulated wood grain table top that usually is 
covered with all kinds of delicacies to prop myself up. At least I 
don't look as bad as Nina does. 

10:15 Where's Scott? At least he might have been able to grab that 
plastic knife out of Nina's hand as she threatened Jane-Marie's life 
if we did not cough up the bag of pretzels and the half-eaten bagel. 
As I quickly stuffed the bagel into my mouth, I planned what I would 
wear to Jane-Marie's funeral, Nina's trial, and Scott's memorial 
service. 

10:30 Where's Scott? Slugging down cups of instant coffee 
without any sweetener because you-know-who was not here, sleuth 
Katherine finally decided to get an answer to the question of the day. 
Posing as a Sears Robuck Catalog Customer Representative surveying 
the satisfaction level of unsatisfied customers, she cleverly 
extracted the information we needed to know. Was he really sick we 
all pondered? Or did he get caught in the paradigm shift and is 
quantum leaping through time?

We didn't have time to ponder this new development as D.A.D. 
(Devil's Advocate Dave) held our hand through HyperCard. I wonder if 
JoAnn realized how hard Dave had to work to get every computer in 
the lab to eat her disk. (At least the computers had something to 
eat!!) I was really amazed at how the other computer functions 
decided to join in on JoAnn's fun. Carol, on the other hand, was able 
to breeze through the program even though she had managed to lose 
her tools somewhere. Maybe they ended up in Pat's trashcan. She did 
try to throw away everything on her disk and the hard drive. The 
tantalizing idea of lunch helped us to find our way out of the stacks. 

1:15 Where's Scott? Lara reported that the hand graphic in Dave's 
presentation looked suspiciously like Scott's REAL hand. All 14 
pairs of eyes gaze at Dave. Did he look like a cannibal? Did the lack 
of FOOD drive Dave to do something like this? Ok, maybe he had 
just trapped Scott in the hypercard stack. Dorothy did mention that 
there was no place like "home". Scoffs probably lounging in that 
cute little house in the hypercard menu eating all the FOOD he had 
prepared for today just laughing at our grumbling and complaining. 
So much for being a positive, role model. 

The afternoon proceeds with everyone frantically finishing papers, 
logs, and resumes. The computer room is jammed with people. We 
found out we had classmates we had never seen before. Maybe that's 
where Scott was - Maybe he was in disguise!! Oh well I guess we'll 
never know!! 



Author's Note: Scott, I hope you realize I only did this to you 
because it was not only your day to bring food but also to write THIS 
LOG THAT I ENDED UP HAVING TO DO BECAUSE I AM THE LOG 
COMMITTEE!! Ok, I've calmed down and decided that I've abused you 
enough!

Ship's Log 
5 August, 1992 

Ship Wrecked at Samford 

There once was a mighty sailor man 
a skipper brave and true, 
13 passengers aboard this ship 
for a short vacation cruise. 

A storm came up... 

The tiny ship was tossed... 

If not for the courage of the fearless crew 
the SUWP ship would be lost. 

The ship set ground on the shore of this 
Samford promised land. 
After five long weeks of survival skills 
they faced just two more days. 

They tried one more time for quiet journals, 

Abused Scott in the morning log. 

The food returned, 

and Scott did too, 

But no one seemed to care. 

" Our captains tried just one more time, 
JoAnn launched a few more tricks, 
workshop how-to's 
and conferencing tips, 
and notebook ideas to share. 

Then Carol tried to gain respect 

with her mini-lesson spread 

on leads about Scott 

(not the missing one) 

and be-ing verbs and "said." 

They escaped for lunch 
but were found at last 
for sharing time again, 
with Peter Pan 
"letting it all hang out" 
individuality, and hair spray. 

Then one more time they faced the beast upstairs 
with twenty-three blinking eyes. 
They typed and trashed and out-circuited him, 
then escaped with much surprise. 



They packed our bags for one more day 
The rescue ship drew near. 
The prime objectives of this ship 
had at last come clear. 

Carol Gilligan, Skipper David, too, 
and first mate called JoAnn, 
no movie stars, just a writing crew 
here on Samford SUWP land. 



log by Mate Diane Weber 
(with help from Waldo) 




The day began typical of any last day - in chaos . There was 
the general clamor to print out "just one more piece . " The 
scrapbook committee was still in training for their gold medal • 
The "type-A" anthology committee was frantically taping page 
numbers. But, with my usual finesse, I managed to cajole everyone 
into one last morning meeting. It was worth the effort, of course, 
because we were treated to Diane ' s "musical 11 log . After we 
completed evaluations, the chaos resumed. 

But what order finally emerged I The scrapbook is certainly 
worthy of its Olympic theme! A million thanks to obsessive Jane- 
Marie and her diligent crew - Lara, Katherine, and Sharon. I'm 
glad I won't be on the committee to compete with this book. And 
the anthology is ready for the printer! I've never known that to 
happen before, at the earliest, Friday afternoon. 

The luncheon was outstanding! The food was delicious, and, 
since it was salads, no calories, right (especially not Jeanne's 
dessert)? But the real treat for the day was the poetry written 
from friend to friend. What a wonderful memento of a summer of 
fun! 

But this log is not intended to just recount today's 
activites. For the past two summers at the end of the institute, 
I always enjoyed reading Peggy's reflections of the summer. Now I 
want to try to give voice to my thoughts about '92. 

It is incredibly difficult to sum up an experience like the 
five weeks of summer institute. Sixteen teachers of varied 
backgrounds, levels of experience, and grade levels meeting 
together for a common purpose — to improve the quality of education 
for the children we teach. We wrote together, shared together, 
laughed together, and cried together ... and we became trusted 
friends, a community. The greatest thing we can do for our 
students, I believe, is to take that experience back into the 
classroom. 

I feel like we all spent the summer "Crossing the River." 
Joy's beautiful and courageous piece touched a chord inside each of 
us. She expressed so movingly the river she crossed this summer. 
But I think we each had our own. For some, the waters seemed more 
perilous than for others. 

I asked, "Are you a writer?" 

Joy answered: "I had doubts but, yes, I am. I have a voice.... At 
first I didn't think I had any stories, but I do. That was a real 
fun discovery - that I do have stories." Joy, yes you do have 
stories, and what a voice! 

Jane-Marie says: "I am an 'essay' writer, not a 'narrative' 
writer. " Can you believe that came from the pen of the person who 
wrote about the white vinyl boots? She also says that writing this 
summer has "opened my mind to a variety of styles of writing I 
never imagined I was able to do." Well, now you know. Let's get 
something published! 



57a 



Pat has a 1 way 8 been a writer, even now she is keeping a family 
journal as a keepsake for her children and theirs. What a 
priceless heirloom - their own "doll named Lucy" to treasure* She 
says, "i hope that my love for writing can be conveyed to my 
student s. who knows? Through my love for this craft, one of them 
may carry through what I've begun." There's no doubt of that. 
Won't it be fun to see which one? 

Jeanne A. says: M I seem to have the ability to strike a common 
chord in others. I've learned I can make people laugh. But I can 
also touch hearts and feelings. Yes, I am a writer, and I like 
that!" Will any of us ever again see an article of clothing on a 
department store floor and not have to struggle to suppress a 
laugh? Thanks for your type-A insight, 

Sharon says: "I have found how powerful my words are.... I always 
had a hard time taking myself seriously as a writer. I hope now I 
can be aware of the power I possess." Sharon, ask your 

grandmother about the power of your words. Thank you for sharing 
yourself and your love of literature with us this summer. 

Lara says: "I want to teach my students in a way they can have fun 
and that will bring meaning to them personally. Writing is an 
excellent tool to use for this accomplishment." You're so right, 
Lara. Please don't be overwhelmed by too many expectations. You 
have so much to offer your students; you're going to be a great 
teacher. 

Jeanne D.says: "I take in the world around me; I examine the world 
within. In my writing, I try to fuse the exterior with the 
interior to create meaning or 'beauty.'" The students at Hayes 
Middle School are fortunate to have someone to expose them to 
beauty and to give them the opportunity to create their own 
someone who believes in them so that they learn to believe in 
themselves . 

Diane writes of dreams put "on-hold" in order to raise a family. 
She speaks of the fulfillment found in encouraging young writers. 
"But," she says, "most of all I recognize that I, too, am still a 
writer; the flame still flickers and needs only the freedom to 
grow. " Does anyone who read "Sweet Milk and Summer Seeder" doubt 
that flame? Don't give up your dream 1 

Katherine says of the summer writing, "I have learned of the 
importance of revision and also the pleasure in revision. It is a 
wonderful thing to feel the strings of authorship, and I can see 
how authorship can fully develop only with the labor and sharing of 
revision." what a great revelation to take and share with our 
students! Katherine, thank you for sharing yourself with us this 
summer.

Scott sayss "I have realized the ability to write lies within a 
part of us, yet it often stays hidden." I'm so glad you looked 
inside and found the poet hidden in there. When you share that 
with your students , I think you'll be amazed at the number of lives 
you'll touch. Thank you for touching our lives this summer. 

Dorothy says: "I find that I write best -as anyone does - when I 
write from the heart. It takes a lot of garbage in my head and on 
paper before I can capture that feeling and ride with it." You 
certainly captured the essence of Peter Pan. You had knew what you 
wanted to say and had the courage to stick with it. What a 
treasure 1 

Nina, I'm sorry that I don't have your portfolio at home as I write 
this. Thank you for sharing your poetry with us this summer. I'm 
expecting you to have some published, and I want a copy. 

David D., You have been a great sport this summer, have taken an 
unmerciful amount Qf kidding. But you have added a level of 
insight heretofore missing in our summer institutes, and we 
appreciate you for that. (I will treasure my poem, and, you're 
right, I'll never see another snake that I don't think of you.) 

JoAnn, what can I say? I have told you privately, but now I say 
publicly, "Thanks! You have been great! I can't imagine 
attempting to conduct the workshop this summer without you." 

David R. , thank you for giving me the opportunity to be involved in 
the writing project at Samford. I don't know anything I have ever 
been professionally involved with that has meant as much to me. 

This has been a terrific five weeks. It's hard to believe it's

Poetry: Tanka and Renga 



BACKGROUND: 

The writing of poetry is a way to get to the heart of thoughts and feelings. The 
Japanese tanka and renga poetry forms, as in all poetry, pack a lot of meaning into carefully 
chosen words. 



APPLICATIONS: 

Because students do not have to worry about meter and rhyme, tanka and renga are 
good poetry forms to use to help students learn to pick and choose details to express their 
thoughts and feelings. 



OBJECTIVES: 

1. To use the Productive Thinking skill (Taylor's Talents). 

2. To learn to write a tanka. 

3. To leam to write a renga (link verse). 

4. To practice using metaphor. 

5. To practice using personification. 



MATERIALS: 

1. Pen/pencil 

2. Paper 

3. Haiku written during JoAnn Trenary's presentation 



PROCEDURES: 

1. Historical background 

a. Late 400's new ideas and technology arrived from China 

b. Eighth century Japan - major form of court poetry; ancestor of haiku 

c. Serious verse written in native language rather than Chinese 
& Lyric poem: 31 syllables 

5-7-5-7-7 

e. Topics: nature, changing glories of seasons, courtship, love 

f. May use metaphor, personification 

2. Divide looseleaf into four columns and head up SPRING, SUMMER, 

AUTUMN, WINTER 



59 

72 



3. List many, varied, unusual nature details for each season (Taylors Talents: 

Productive Thinking). List things you would see, hear, smell, feel, taste in 
a particular season. 

4. Share with the group some of the details that were listed. 

5. Distribute samples of of tanka. 

6. Talk about pattern and content: lyric poem 

5 lines: 5-7-5-7-7 

use of metaphor and personification 

7. Using your four-column chart, choose a season and write a tanka. 

8. Share tanka with group. 

9. Meet with response group to write a renga and bring your haiku. 

10. Format of renga: link verse (haiku originated as opening verse of a renga) 

5-7-5 7-7 (repeat stanzas in that pattern) 
point is NOT to tell a story; connected to stanza just before but 
moves in some new direction 

11. Decide on whose haiku to use as a starting point; the next person adds the 7-7 

stanza; the next person another 5-7-5 stanza, and the last person a 7-7 
stanza until everyone has made a contribution. 

12. Share renga with group. 

13. Group feedback: Did you like writing Japanese poetry? Why? Did you dislike 

writing Japanese poetry? Why? (It's important to try your hand at various 
forms of poetry because a student won't know if suits him/her until tried.)

LOVE LETTERS IN THE CLASSROOM 



BACKGROUND: 

This presentation is the result of writing that takes place in many of student's lives. The 
ability to communicate with friends through letters is evident in our classroom, but 
sometimes not as evident when it comes to required material. 

The presentation itself brings out the hidden talents of our students and focuses on their 
communication skills. It opens the minds of our students to a world of writing they didn't 
know was a part of their classes. 



APPLICATION: 

Writing letters in the classroom is applicable to any grade level. Secondary teachers may 
see better responses from the junior high students because of their fascination with friendly 
and love notes in class. 

CLASSROOM OBJECTIVES: 

Students will: 

1. Recognize that there are four basic purposes for writing: to 
narrate, to describe, to explain, and to persuade. 

2. Determine their own purpose for their writing. 

3. Identify the audience for their writing. 

4. Consider their own experiences as they chose a subject to write 
about. 

PROCEDURE: 

1. The students will be given a general background on why skills and techniques are 
important along with the idea that our students must enjoy writing. 

2. The students will then be asked to give examples of their codes and symbols found 
within the letters that they write to their friends. 

3. After displaying these codes and symbols on the board, the students will then give 
examples of opening lines found in their letters. 

4. Students will then be informed of the pans of a friendly letter and how they parallel 
those found in the letter they write to their friends. 

5. The students will then write a letter to any given friend in 

or out of class. These letters will be given to the individual that they were intended for and 
some will be read in class. 

6. The class will then be divided into response groups and given specific instructions on 
writing letters to each of the response groups.

Writing Workshop: Integrating Computers into the Composing Process 



Background: 

Currently, researchers are attempting to discover the effects of "thinking aid" programs that 
are used to supplement word processing software by guiding students through the entire 
composing process. The shortcoming with this type of software is that it is too "generic." 
This is, it seems to be of limited value considering the wide variety of approaches to the 
composing process seen in freshperson composition texts today. 

The text that I use in my freshperson courses, Four Worlds of Writing, is a good example. 
It's very specific approach to the genesis of discourse, invention, thesis, organization, and 
audience make the effectiveness of generic "thinking aid" software questionable. 

One approach to this problem is to develop our own "thinking aid" files to supplement the 
texts that we use. Because composing is a non-linear, recursive process, I have decided 
to produce files on HyperCard, a program that allows you to organize material in a 
conceptual, non-linear fashion; therefore it "mimics" the composing process of the 
students. 

Description/Application: 

HyperCard produces files in the format of "stacks." A stack is any number of cards related 
to a central concept Therefore it is possible to create stacks that are related to particular 
components of the composing process (that are presented in the text book). While students 
compose, if their processes become recursive, they can "jump" to the appropriate stack of 
cards to lead them through that particular component of the composing process. 

In addition, these files can easily be interactive in nature. As students move through a 
stack, they will encounter explanations of the component being worked on, see examples 
of that work and blank cards to record their own work. Instructions to refer to the text, 
instructor, or response group can also be included.

WRITING TO LEARN THROUGH LITERATURE WRITTEN 
BY NATIVE AMERICANS 



BACKGROUND: 

This presentation is an outgrowth of my desire to have students care more about one 
another, to understand and be more tolerant of another culture, and to realize there could be two 
sides to an issue or event. 

In addition I agree with Donald Murray in Write to Learn that writing increases your 
awareness of the world around you, and reading can provide a subject for writing. 



APPLICATION: 

Writing to learn through literature written by Native Americans is applicable to all levels of 
high school. Elementary teachers could use it in a history lesson or by supplying stories on their 
grade level. There is a wealth of books and other information about Native Americans available at 
the local library. 

CLASSROOM OBJECTIVES: 

My objectives are designed for students to become more responsible toward other people 
and their backgrounds, and to become more sensitive about differences among people. 

1 . Students will develop an awareness that another culture "setded" this country. 

2. Students will develop an awareness that this culture has been sterotyped. 

3. Students will realize that Indians were citizens of this nation but were conquered by 
strangers who knew nothing of their beliefs or values. 

4. Students will become aware that ,as prisoners, Indians were striped of their homes, land 
and beliefs. 



PROCEDURES: 

Students' homework was to read the Native Americans' writings in the literature book. 
Students were instructed to find out what country their parents or grandparents are descendants of 
or learn about a family tradition that they liked. 



LESSON PRESENTATION: 

1. Pre- writing assignment is to write about students' roots, background or a family tradition 
that they like. Pre-writing is timed for 15 minutes.

2. Students were asked how Hollywood portrays Indians, These descriptions were written 
on the blackboard to contrast how the Indians portrayed themselves in the literature. 



3. For writing purposes as we read these selections students were asked to put themselves in 
Black Hawk's , Chief Joseph's place or imagine themselves as one of the Indians who has been 
captured. Another suggestion could be to write about injustices . What is injustice, have they 
been the object of an injustice, have they been a party to inflicting an injustice on someone or 
have they seen an injustice done and not done anything about it? 



4 . Read aloud "Black Hawk's Farewell," "The Surrender of Chief Joseph," and Chief 
Joseph's article "An Indian's Views of Indian Affairs" 



VARIATIONS : 

1. Read Native American poetry and compare with American poetry. 

2. Read a legend ("The Blackfeet Genesis is an example) and write your own legend 

3. Use for a comparison and contrast writing lesson.

A Writer Reads Art 

BACKGROUND: 

This presentation is a model for integrating fine arts and language arts into an 
extended thematic and skill - developing unit with emphasis on using visual an to initiate 
and enhance student writing. 

APPLICATION: 

"A Writer Reads Art" is applicable to any grade level and subject area. 
OBJECTIVES: 

My objectives are designed to foster creativity, perception, expression, and self- 
esteem in my students; they also "teach communication, give students a sense of 
civilization, and provide tools for critical assessment" (NCTE, 1988). 

1. Students will develop a more keen perception. 

2. Students will communicate in several different modes. 

3. Students will use words, symbols, and images to create and recreate meaning. 

4. Students will not only gain insight into their common political and cultural 
heritage, but also into their own personal struggle. 

PROCEDURES: 

1. Create atmosphere by immersing students in visual ait, using art books, prints, 
postcards, and discussion. 

2. Illustrate relationship between visual art and writing by using examples of 
writing that has inspired art and art that has inspired writing. Example: "The Lady of 
Shallot" 

3. Explore and discuss extended metaphor of writer as painter. Writer and painter 
share the same purpose, but each uses different media. 

4. Have students produce visual images to express concepts and emotions. 
Examples: poverty, rage, embarrassment. Have students share and explain images. 

5. Have students search for word phrases that create pictures in their minds. 
Allow students to use any medium to reproduce images visually. 

6. Have students select piece of visual art to contemplate. 

7. Have students freewrite on their perceptions of art work. 

8. Have students "paint" with words a poem or story that follows the theme of art 

work. 

9. Have students share in response groups and revise poem or story.

CONNECTING READING AND WRITING 
USING AUTHOR PROFILES 



BACKGROUND: 

Connecting reading and writing can always be done by having the students read 
good literature. By providing ample time to write after they read, the students will 
hopefully adopt helpful writing skills used by their favorite, most widely read authors. 

APPLICATION: 

This lesson is designed to enhance student writing by letting them learn about the 
lives of the authors about which they read. By building author profiles, the students 
incorporate research skills while collecting helpful information about the lives of their 
favorite authors. Profiles help the students learn about how these authors 1 lives influenced 
their writings. The students can then view themselves as real authors as they write about 
their own life experiences. 

CLASSROOM OBJECTIVES: 

My overall objective is to allow the students to learn about a variety of authors with 
whom they can identify and possibly emulate as they develop a writing style of their own. 

1 . Students will utilize listening skills by first listening to a poem by Edgar Allan 

Poe. 

2. Students will freewrite their opinion of what kind of person would have written 
this poem. 

3. Students will realize how this author used his own life experiences in his 
writing. 

4. Students will write a descriptive paragraph utilizing devices used by this author 
as well as incorporating their own experiences into the piece. 

5. Students will share this piece with a response group, making necessary 
corrections. 

6. Students will think of an author whom they would like to research. 

7. Students will use sources such as biographical indexes, encyclopedias, 
periodical literature, and card catalogs to reasearch their author. 

PROCEDURES: 

L Explain that there are two basic ways to connect reading and writing. One is by 
learning to write from other writers (Atwell, 228 & 252). Another is by developing a sense 
of authorship through creating author profiles ( Calkins, 230). 

2. Model sample author profiles by reading samples from index cards. The author 
sketches are taken from Something About the Author, (pp. 167-91) and "Stories from 



i 



70 #3 



Author's Lives" from Lucy Calkin's book, Writing Workshop: A World of Difference. 
(pp. 134-9). 

3. Read "Annabel Lee M (Poe,170-182). 

4. Freewrite on what kind of man they perceive Poe to be. Read samples and 
discuss any questions they have about Poe. In this discussion, point out incidents in his 
life that were used in his writings. For example, editor Anne Commire includes Poe's 
reference to his first school house in England "My earliest recollections of a school life 
are connected with a large, rambling, Elizabethan house. . ." (Poe, p. 174). In Ei ght Tales 
of Terror. Poe describes a similar setting in "The Fall of the House of Usher" (p. 93). Say 
that the reason I used Poe for an author profile is because he is a good example of someone 
whose life is reflected in their writings. 

5. Read a sample of Poes* very descrptive language. Tell the students to look at 
the detail he uses in his descriptions. Tell them that detail has to be used in other types of 
writing as well. 

6- Introduce the writing activity. After modeling a sample missing person's report 
(Bushman, p. 61), they will break into response groups to write one of their own. They 
can describe someone in the room, or one of Poes' characters they have read about. 

7. After sharing the reports, talk about why detail was so important in the 
descriptions. Read another descrptive paragraph by Poe. One describing the room of the 
Usher estate in "The Fall of the House of Usher" (Poe, pp. 98-99). Then write about a 
place they can think of, being as descriptive as possible.

Plugging Into Students' Interests: 
Using Music Videos in the Writing Classroom 



BACKGROUND: 

According to Aileen Pace Nilsen and Kenneth L. Donelson, in their boo k Literature for 
Today's Young Adults , there are several reasons for potential success when integrating 
music videos in the classroom: 

1. Videos combine two things teenagers are interested in: 
music and television. 

2. Videos are usually short, only three or four minutes 
long, which provides adequate class discussion /writing 
time. 

3. Videos provide "stepping stones to develop abilities 
that will help students in approaching literature and 

a r writing because they are usually rich in imagery and 
symbolism." 

While many people argue that music videos are neither drama nor literature, if the broad 
definition of literature includes all writings in either prose or verse that are of an imaginative 
nature and reflect a particular culture, then both of these qualify as literature. They 
can be used to help students gain a broader and better understanding of convennonal print 
literature and can serve as an excellent basis from which to write. 

APPLICATION: 

Music videos can be used in the drama, speech, creative writing and English classroom. 
OBJECTIVES: 

1. Students will view videos. 

2. Students will chart comparisons/contrasts of video and songs. 

3. Students will work in response groups to create comparison- 
contrast paragraphs. 

4. Students will share paragraphs on the overhead transparency 
machine. 

PROCEDURES: 

1. Show one music video to students 

2. Fill in practice chart of various aspects of the video 

3. Show another music video 

4. Fill in the other side of the chart 

5. Briefly discuss the similarities and differences in the two videos 

6. Show two other similar videos 

7. Have students fill in chart, noting similarities and difference in videos 

8. Have students write comparison and contrast paragraphs 

9. Have students share paragraphs on the overhead transparency machine 



72 

8,; 



MATERIALS: 



1. Pre-taped and previewed tapes of music videos 

2. Charts for comparison and contrast 

3. Transparencies and markers for overhead presentations 



EXTENSIONS: 

Using music videos is a great way to "plug into" students' 
interests while teaching several important skills: 

1. Identifying theme, imagery, symbolism and tone 

2. Writing critical reviews 

3. Writing business and friendly letters 

4. Writing to compare and contrast

COLLABORATIVE FICTION WRITING 



BACKGROUND: 

The large portion of what students write takes place individually. One way we as 
teachers can help students learn to cooperate as a group and be accepting of others' ideas is 
to have them write collaboratively. By working together in smail groups of three or four 
people, students can learn the importance of cooperation as well as have the chance to 
obtain useful ideas from peers. 

Fiction is a good type of writing for students to work on collaboratively. Fiction 
writing is hard for many students to compose, so a small group working together to form a 
single story provides for a variety of ideas. 

APPLICATION: 

Collaborative fiction writing can prove to be useful at both elementary and 
secondary grade levels. Just as individual writing is good for both levels, working 
together cooperatively in small groups will also benefit students at any level. 

OBJECTIVES: 

As a result of this lesson, students will.be better prepared: 

1 . To use their creative ability and imagination in writing. 

2. To work cooperatively in small groups. 

3. To illustrate their fiction writing skills. 
PROCEDURES: 

1 . The day before this lesson, the teacher will need to prepare the five item bags. 
The number of bags you prepare will depend on your individual class size. You may want 
to consider using small groups of three or four students. Fill each brown paper bag (the 
size of an ordinary lunch bag) with five random items. Choose selectively remembering 
that your students are going to use these items to create a fiction story. Number the outside 
of each bag. 

2. The teacher will introduce fiction writing to the class. Share several quotes with 
them from Donald H. Graves' book Experiment With Fiction. Choose ones that will allow 
students to be able to apply fiction to their own lives. Provide a handout of quotes if you 
choose. 

3. Write these terms on the board: first lines, leads, character introductions, 
character development, and ending lines. Using Graves' book you will need to define, 
discuss, and give examples of these terms as they relate to fiction writing. 

4. Use Graves' ten minute fiction writing experiment as a pre-writing assignment 
(pp 1 1-15). You may choose whether or not to give students a choice of selected topics. 



ERLC 



74 

87 



5. After the experiment, share your writing and ask for volunteers to share what 
they have written. Point out in each piece the elements of fiction writing (see #2) that 
already appear just from a ten minute experiment. 

6. Explain to students that you are going to break them up into small groups of 
three of four in order to write a short fiction story together. Tell them that each group will 
receive a small brown paper bag that contain five random items. Each bag of items is 
different. As a group, they are to create a short fictional story involving the five items 
inside their bag. The story may be a mystery, a romance, or even a story about the owner 
of the five items. Tell them that these are only suggestions and they may create whatever 
type of story they want. Tell them to be sure to directly involve the five items inside their 
bag. 

7. Break students up into small groups and give a numbered brown bag to each 
group. Designate one student to write the story down on paper. Give them the rest of the 
class period to write. At the end of class they are to return their bags to you with the items 
inside. Have them come into class the next day and pick up their numbered bag in order to 
complete their stories. 

8. Bring the class back together as a whole after students have had ample time to 
complete their stories. Have one person from each group come to the front of the room and 
read his/her fiction story. Have each one begin by displaying the five items that his/her 
group had to work with from the bag. Again you may point out the fiction elements that 
have been included in each story.

GETTING THE 'SCOOP' ON LITERATURE 



BACKGROUND: 

This presentation comes from a desire to give students an opportunity to work "hands on" with 
literature. Students often do not want to spend any more time thaan they have to with any piece of 
literature and therefore miss the opportunity to fully explore the many facets literature has to offer. 
This presentation gives a student a chance to work with the literature selection as a reader, writer 
and a presenter. 

Knowing what an interest our youth have in visual media, with CNN and MTV News as 
examples, they are already well-equipped to begin this activity. 

APPLICATION: 

This activity is designed for any secondary grade level and subject. Younger grades would 
probably need some assistance. This activity may also be used with a variety of literary genres: 
short stories, plays, poems, etc. 

OBJECTIVES: 

1. Students will read a literature selection. 

2. Students will engage in group discussion. 

3. Students will gain confidence as a speaker. 

4. Students will write while cooperating with a group 
PROCEDURES: 

1. Students read a selected piece of literature. 

2. Students break into groups. 

3. Students brainstorm over the many "news angles" possible. 

4. Students write various news reports and/or interviews. 

5. Students present their "news report" as a professional news team. 

6. Videotape for more fun!

Telling Tales To Learn: 
Reading and Writing About History 

BACKGROUND: 

I want students to be able to understand that history is not just a collection of dates 
and names to memorize. History is a collection of many peoples' life stories. This 
presentation focuses on the student as a storyteller. Every person has a story to tell 
whether it is about a trip to a store or to the beach. When students are able to recognize the 
stories in history they will see the connection between the past and the present. Janet 
Hickman states, "Stories in history are a good way to make it seem close, immediate, and 
real enough to interest children in the larger issue that they need to consider." 

This presentation focuses first on the student as a personal storyteller. The student 
chooses a family story to tell. The students learn to recognize the different aspects of 
stories. Then the student chooses a story from history to learn and to be able to retell. 
The student studies historical fiction, legends, and stories from different time periods. 
Finally the student writes historical fiction stories. Linda Christensen suggests, "Students 
reinvent history by writing through a real or imagined character from the past. They live, at 
least momentarily, the lives of the people they create." 

APPLICATION: 

This focus on storytelling is designed for fourth grade through sixth grade. The 
reading and writing aspect of this presentation tends to lend itself to the upper elementary 
grades. Teachers of the primary grades may use picture books to make it more applicable 
in these grades. The lower grades are a perfect audience for many of the upper grade level 
students' historical stories. These activities would span several months of building 
storytelling skills, recognizing aspects of stories, and reading various stories. 

CLASSROOM OBJECTIVES: 

1. The students will demonstrate their own voice in personal stories. 

2. The students will gain self-confidence, courage, and trust. 

3. Students will use critical thinking to compare stories from different views about 
the same incident in history. 

4. Students will read stories about fictional characters in history. 

5. Students will write historical fiction stories. 

PROCEDURES: 

1. To introduce the idea of stories, tell the students one of your own personal 
experience stories. Encourage the students to share any stories they might have orally with 
the class. It could be any story that they thought of while you were telling your story. 
Have them tell the story to a partner. 

2. Ask the students to go home and talk to relatives about a family story. It could 
be a story about an incident in the individual student's life or about a member of his 
family. Encourage the students to choose a story they like. Students may videotape the 
stories or put them on a tape recorder. Have the students practice telling the stories to 
classmates, tape recorders, and family members. A good book to use to introduce this idea 
is Knots on A Counting Rope by Bill Martin Jr. and John Archabault. Give each student a 
counting rope to keep track of his practicing. Videotape the students telling their stories 
when they feel comfortable. Then choose different audiences to listen to the stories. 




3. Let the students choose a story in history. I usually begin with a focus on 
Native American stories. Have each student read various stories to find one he would like 
to tell. After choosing a story to tell, the student needs to practice telling it. Aft it 
practicing, the student then needs tell his story to his response group. Each group helps 
improve the story until the storyteller is ready to present it to an audience. Let the class be 
the first audience and then expand. Make a videotape of each student's story. 

4. After much reading and discussing historical fiction stories introduce the idea 
of writing by using a historical journal set in a certain time period. Let each student decide 
on his own character and setting. Discuss the idea of realism. 

5. To culminate the unit, each student will write his own historical fiction story. 
Let the student chose a time period and setting from any of the ideas already studied. The 
student will research to make his story realistic. Encourage each student to publish his 
story.

TEACHING THE WRITING PROCESS THROUGH INTERVIEWS 

BACKGROUND: 

This presentation is an outgrowth of my love for and experience with high school 
publications. As a novice adviser, I quickly learned that interviewing was an excellent way 
to develop critical thinking skills, effective usage of quotations and leads, and revision. 

APPLICATIONS: 

Interviewing can be adapted to any grade level. By having students question each 
other, it can be an excellent "ice-breaker" to establish an environment of acceptance. 
Interviewing can also be a major research tool. According to Linda Rief in Seeking 
Diversity, "One of the most important strategies we can give kids for gathering information 
is how to conduct an interview." 

OBJECTIVES: 

My objective is to teach the writing process through interviewing. According to 
Rief s Seeking Diversity, 

1. Students will experience the entire writing process as writer, reader, speaker, 
listener.. 

2. Students will research a topic by brainstorming question, reflect on information 
by looking for surprise, finding specifics, and connecting ideas. 

3. Students will rehearse their own voices, reveal what they know, and restructure 
a meaningful text for thimselves. 

4. Students will learn skills in context: interviewing techniques, leads, and quotes. 

PROCEDURES: 

This unit can be covered in two days or even a week, depending on the amount of 
information you wish to cover. I also use an overhead projector for models/examples. 

1. Have students write a paragraph that discusses three newsworthy or interesting 
facts that classmates might like to know aboul them. (This idea was adapted from Fedler's 
Reporting for the Print Media, Chapter 15.) 

2. Have students choose a partner about whom they know very little. Select a 
partner yourself if there is an odd number of students. Have students read each other's 
paragraphs. 

3. Hand out 3 5x8 index cards to each person. Fold two of the index cards in half. 
Number each half consecutively, 1-4. The third "straight" card should be numbered 
section 5. 

4. Explain how to ask questions in an interview. I try to give no more than 4 
"tips" at a time. (I use suggestions and examples from Schumacher's Creative 
Conversations, Chapter 3). 

5. Section 1 -Students will then use the paragraphs (or their own imaginations, for 
that matter) as a basis to write 5 questions they would like to ask their partners. 

6. Section 2-Students will ask their partners these questions and record them in 
section 2. 

7. Section 3— Students should review the answers to the questions they asked. 
They should look for elements of surprise or things they would like to know more about. 
Then have students list 5 more questions that focus on that one thing in section 3. 



ERIC 



8. Before students ask their second set of questions, discuss the importance of 
direct quotes in an interview. I show effective quotes and discuss why they are effective (I 
use examples from Biagi's Interviews that Work). 

9. Section 4-This time I have students ask their new questions and record the 
answers in section 4. I ask them to look for direct quotes or significant words that might 
be effective when they write up their drafts. 

10. Explain effective leads. I use Nancie Atwell's examples from In the Middle, 
Chapter 6. Also explain that their compositions should have a body and a conclusion. 

11. Section 5— Have students compose a draft that would help a reader get to know 
the person they're interviewing. Rief s Seeking Diversity has short excellent models you , 
may show them before they begin. 

12. Have students share their drafts with their partners. Partners check information 
for accuracy and respond to what "stood out" or to what he/she likes. 

13. At this point I go over one or two elements of good writing before I have 
students revise their drafts. I talk about using active verbs and avoiding forms of the verb 
be, for instance. I model a bad writing example with this problem and ask for their help in 
revising it. Have students revise their drafts by looking for the problems just discussed. 

14 Ask if anyone would like to share his or her piece of writing. 
15. Discuss with students what they have leamed/done in view of the previously 
listed objectives.

THE COMPOSING PROCESS: MAKING MEANING 



presentation by Diane Weber 

"Making meaning with language is like making sense of the world " Ann E. Berthoff 
BACKGROUND 

My students and I begin each year with an exploration of language as a tool of the artist. 
We observe our world around us and try to see in it a freshness and new detail, and we try to relate 
that experience to our reader. We explore how we are all co-creators of reality for our readers, how 
we tap into shared experiences and reasonings. We then apply these discussions to the first step of 
revision process, which Donald Murray terms "Revising for Meaning." 

APPLICATION: 

The writing process is applicable to all levels of writing instruction. The middle and 
secondary students are capable not only of engaging in the writing process but also of thinking 
about their process and understanding the role of the writer in recreating an event or attitude for the 
reader. The Johns Hopkins model was designed for verbally talented eighth and ninth graders, but 
I have found the activities adaptable through the senior level of writing instruction. 

CLASSROOM OBJECTIVES: 

1. Students will develop an awareness of the relationship of the event, the writer, and the 

reader and the writer's role in the recreation of the event. 

2. Students will expand their perception of language. 

3. Students will sharpen and expand observation skills and develop a freshness of 

approach in description of observation subjects. 

4. Students will understand the recursive fluidity of the writing process. 

5. Students will use the writing process in class assignments. 

6. Students will learn to work in response groups. 

7. Students will revise for meaning. 

PROCEDURES: The Composing Process: "Back-and-Forthness" 

To have perceived or known anything at all, we have had to form the buzz and chaos of 
sensation and experience into stable and usable forms. We aren't given our worlds; we form them, 
and thinking and writing are extensions of what our composing imagination have had to do since 
the cradle. (Freshman English Manual. Mnrgnpttp TTnivprcity 1987-88) 

This presentation actually covers three class sessions at the beginning cf the term and is 
preceded by discussions and activities activities involving journal writing, observational writing, 
patterns of perception, and the writing process as a re-creation of reality for the reader (Sources- 
FQrmjng^hinkjng/Wnting by Ann E. Berthoff and Writing Instruction for Vp.rhallv Tinted 
Youth: The John Hopkin s Model ) 

In the days of the unit that are described below, we expand our discussion of perception 
and re-creation with an exercise on "Study of Two Pears" (by Wallace Stevens), using as our guide 
the third chapter of Writing Instruction We read and discuss pages 260-269 in Robert Pirsig's Zen 
and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance (1 Q74V and we experiment with creating paragraphs from 
seed sentences (beginnings and endings). We then compare our created paragraphs with the 
original paragraphs and discuss the author's diction, syntax, and detail, and the tools for 
successfully tapping into our "harmonious reasonings." 



9 

ERJC 



si 94 



Whether we want the responsibility or not, whatever we write, fiction or nonfiction, taps 
into these harmonious reasonings or collective experiences or unconscious and creates a reality for 
our reader. 

Methods of Tapping into Meaning 

1 . Analogy and metaphor 

a. examples: stoned, zonked, bombed, ugly as a toad, 

'You are the wind beneath my wings." 
What he said left a bad taste in my mouth. 
Idea is offshoot of another. The seed of an idea. 

b. synesthesia examples: honey voice (Homer's Odvssev ). loud colors 

silver silence (Wilde), sleep smell 

2. Denotation and connotation 

a. examples: 

b. game to play: Ping Pong (described in Forming/Thinking/Writing ) 

3. Cadence of sentences 

a. effect of short, choppy 

b. effect of long, flowing 

4. Sounds of words (round or sharp) 

5. Punctuation

FRIENDS: A LOOK AT PERSONAL WRITING 



"Language is the picture and counterpart of thought." -Mark Hopkins 



BACKGROUND: 

Atwell writes in IN THE MIDDLE that "...students learn actively through a social 
process that involves them in talking, doing, sharing, listening." 

Murray, also, in A WRITER TEACHES WRITING, states, "We write to think." 

"Learners have to find their own voices", is how Rief puts it in SEEKING 
DIVERSITY. 

In other words, we learn best when we write what has meaning for us. When 
teachers encouragingly support students in this kind of learning experience,students 
perceive that they are writing to learn, and not learning to write. 



APPLICATIONS: 

It's been my experience that my students write more enthusiastically when they 
have topics relevant to their lives. Often theyVe told me that they couldn't make it through 
a day without their friends. When they recognize the influence of others in their lives, they 
learn to build better relationships. Using writing is a helpful way for them to discuss their 
feelings about friends, and to foster thinking. 



OBJECTIVES: 

Students will write about friends and discuss the qualities that exist in a friendship. 
Students will compare/contrast characteristics of friends. 
Students will explore and make value choices concerning friendships. 
Students will share their writing through response groups and whole class 
activities. 



PROCEDURES: 

Show visuals of friends. (Music tapes relating to frienships may be played at this 
time). Ask students to think about people that are special to them as friends. 
Write on board: 

"Make new friends, but keep the old: 
One is silver, and the other is gold" 
-Old proverb 

Share meaning by having students think about the proverb. Have them recall old 
friends that aie still dear, and newer friends that will eventually be 'gold'. 

Have class think about and share titles of books they have read on friends and the 
reasons for the friendship. 

Give origin of word 'FRIEND 1 (comes from Germanic - Teutonic/Goths - who 
were warring people and originally meant 'love'). 



ERLC 



84 

97 



Note the positive connotation of the word 'FRIEND': (U.S.S.Friendship, 
unmanned spacecraft; Friendly Islands; Society of Friends, etc.). 

Share special friends (Ex: a favorite doll, stuffed animal, or photograph). Tell 
students about them as you show them. 

Use student response groups to have students collaborate in making lists of famous 
friendships in literature, real fife, tv, and fantasy and reasons for these friendships. Share 
with the class. 

As a class, discuss types of friends: positive - crossover (common to both types) - 
negative. Use Venn diagram with these headings. Have students share their ideas. 
Students spend fifteen to twenty minutes writing about the topic of friends. 
Students may share a favorite line or their entire piece. 

EXTENSIONS: 

Students may choose to write a finished piece, following the steps of the writing 
process. 

Students may draw names and create friendship cards to give to each other.

For Whom the Cat Purrs 
by 

Jeanne Averhart 



The birds hadn't even started their early morning song when Tar 
Baby stood up in a long stretch. He was hungry, and he knew that he and 
Tigger had finished all their dry food last night, so nothing was out. That 
was okay; he knew the solution to that little problem. He jumped down 
from the entertainment center to the sofa to the floor and hurried to the 
bedroom. 

Just as he suspected, Jeanne was still asleep. Up on the bed he 
bounded, took a few moments to scratch his neck, smooth down some fur, 
and looked over at the body in the middle of the bed. Still asleep. Tigger 
was stretched out to Jeanne's left, so Tar Baby hopped across her legs and 
padded up the other side, purring loudly. With a quick side step, he 
plopped his seventeen pounds on her chest, within a tongue's lick of her 
nose. 

By now Jeanne was breathing lightly, and Tar Baby KNEW she was 
awake. When she didn't get up to feed him, he began licking her nose and 
nibbling sharply on her chin. She rolled over on her side to dislodge him, 
but he wasn't so easily dissuaded. 

Tar Baby went for the nose again. 

"Oh, Tar Baby!" Jeanne moaned and rolled to the other side, turning 
her back on the persistent black cat. That didn't dissuade him either. He 
climbed on her shoulder, slid to the other side, and began again his frontal 
attack. 

This time he got the results he wanted! A sleepy Jeanne rose 
grudgingly, if not testily, and stumbled to the kitchen where an eager cat 
awaited the food he had worked so hard for.

Pains of a Perfectionist 
by 

Jeanne Averhart 



Everybody says I'm so dependable* Everybody says they can count on 
me* Everybody says, "Good oV Jeanne! Give her a job and she makes sure it gets 
done!" 

Well now, "good ol' Jeanne" is here to tell you that being a Type A 
personality is a real pain! 

People have no idea how much Type A 's suffer to be perfect. The second week 
of June aptly illustrates my point* 

I "volunteered" to help out for our parish's Vacation Bible School* Everything 
was going just fine, and I was having great fun learning the songs, being 
appropriately animated, and not being responsible for any of it. 

Then, boom! Thursday morning at 6:00 A.M. the choir director called and 
said, "I have some good news and some bad news." 

"Let me have the bad news first," I said, my stomach starting to knot up like a 
pretzel. 

"I've got a major plumbing problem, and I can't make Vacation Bible School 
today. But, don't worry, Nancy will be there and she can play the music." 

Now, Type A's not only prefer to get bad news out of the way right off, but 
they are innately suspicious of anything that sounds like a flimsy excuse so I asked, 
"What kind of major plumbing problem?" 

"A kitchen pipe burst in the wall behind the cabinets. It looks like an all day 

job." 

"So ok, what do you want me to do with the kids?" 

The choir director rattled off things to do and songs to sing as I dutifully 
copied them down. 

Then, I got on the phone and called Nancy, telling her the bad news (there was 
no good news). 

"Oh, Jeanne," she wailed. (The pretzel did another loop and a half.) "I can't 
be there today. I scheduled my daughters for physicals months ago, not knowing 
when we would have Vacation Bible School." 

It's really pitiful to heai a grown woman cry, so I didn't. Instead, I tried to 
make soothing remarks and get off the phone as fast as I could to find my guitar and 
start practicing. 

That was about 6:30, and Vacation Bible School started at 9:30. 

When I got to church, I told all concerned that the choir director wasn't going 
to make it. Did I get any sympathetic clucks or concern about my by now VERY 
tender fingers? No! Just assurances of "you can do it, we know." I should feel so 
confident. 

By noon, I felt emotionally wrung out, and yes, things had gone well* I 
survived K-6 by myself, and the kids enjoyed themselves. (But, the pretzel had 
corkscrewed in on itself.) 

Since medical science has made such strides with face lifts and tummy tucks, I 
want a personality transplant. 

I want to be a couch potato and not feel guilty. 

•I want to have a relaxed shuffle and drop my military walk. 

I want to be able to go shopping and not feel compelled to rehang articles that 
have fallen to the floor. 

Just a little transplant?

Returning the Magic 



Once upon a time, not so very long ago, a young maiden entered a special land-a 
magical place, filled with creativity and laughter, books and stories, cardboard castles and 
paper teepees— the land of Classume. The maiden entered full of joy, excitement, and 
dreams to share with the children there. 

But into the land came a dragon, breathing fire and destroying the magic. The 
dragon was known by many names--BCT, CAT, SAT, ACT. His power permeated the 
land. Everyone feared him and strove to appease nim. 

"I will give you some of my games and laughter if you will let me stay here," said 
the maiden. 

The dragon forced the joy and spontaneity from Classume. He demanded drills, 
routine, and fillintheblanks. Purple fluid dripped from his jaws. Duplicate... duplicate was 
his cry. "What is your percentile rank?" he roared continually, demanding homage from 
all. 

The dragon maintained control for a long time. No one dared oppose him. The 
young maiden sadly submitted to his demands. 

At last a knight rode into Classume. "I want to challenge the dragon. I want to free 
the children," he boldly stated. 

The knight held a powerful weapon—a pen. He knew that if he could put the pen 
into the hands of the children, they could break the evil spell. 

The knight proclaimed, "Let the children write! Listen to their voices! Empower 
them with confidence!" 

Most of the people were skeptical- they were still controlled by fear of the dragon. 
They \ ad heard his roar and had felt his fire. They did not believe children with pens could 
overcome such a mighty force. 

But the warrior gave the weapons to the children and their voices rang out. 
Slowly.. .slowly.. .the people began to listen. A few even viewed the dragon with less 
fear. 

More and more leaders of Classume— people called teachers-heard the words of the 
courageous knight and listened to the voices of the children. The maiden and other teachers 
visited a place of renewed magic-a place called Writing Project. They learned ways to use 
the pen effectively. 

This dragon would not be easily overcome. He wos, after all, deeply entrenched 
into the system. But the magic was returning to Classume; the voices of the children were 
being freed. The teachers were determined not to turn back. They braced themselves for a 
long fight— a fight they knew they must win.

Straddling the Fence 
or, Life is Rhetoric(al) 



Life can be seen as a fence, or better, a series of fences that represents various facets and 
issues in our existence. Most "normal" people stand on one side or the other of these 
fences, but rhetoricians are different. Because one area of their expertise is essentially the 
ability to assume multiple perspectives on any issue, they often reach the conclusion that 
most issues don't have inherently "right" or "wrong" answers. The world of the 
rhetoricians is gray, not black and white, so they often end up straddling the fences of life 
for uncomfortably long periods of time. (This reminds me of Larry Slade, a character from 
Eugene O'Neill's The Iceman Cometh:: "I was bom condemned to be one of those who has 
to see all sides of a question. When you're damned like that, the questions multiply for 
you until in the end it's all question and no answer.") This can make life difficult, or at 
least very weird at times, as was the case with Larry. And, over time, I've come to realize 
that I can't "fall back" into the more "idealistic" perspective on life; I am a relativist. While 
not the druken bum "foolosopher" that Larry was, I do spend a large part of my time 
analyzing positions, and I wish others would do the same. 

Of course, "relativist" is a dirty word for many people, especially in these conservative 
times. (Although, as a relativist, I am compelled to point out that fervent liberals are just as 
"black and white" in their thinking as conservatives: Larry pointed out the "blinders" of the 
members of the anarchist movement.) It connotes other evil terms like "radical" and 
"liberal," although relativists don't really fall into these or any other "camps" (at least not 
at the intellectual level). 

Perhaps the best example is the "case" of lawyers. Often, they are accused of "playing up" 
to the judge and jury, but they know that the key to persuasion lies in the audience, and that 
the perspective of that audience, its views, opinions, biases, is the most important factor in 
winning a case, and probably not the "letter of the law." 

But lawyers aren't relativists (at least I don't think so); their business is intimately 
connected with decisions. But fence straddlers don't make decisions; they simply view 
the various issues of the world from their lofty perches on the fence. The positions on the 
different sides of the fence are not necessarily better or worse than the others (or more right 
or wrong, etc.), just different. 

The obvious conclusion of non-rhetoricians is that fence straddlers are ineffectual; they 
don't do anything but observe various positions. However, that in itself makes them very 
valuable: they have no vested interest in the positions and can therefore provide a more 
"objective" perspective. This perspective is actually an important insight that can't be 
discovered by those on one side of the fence or the other (although they usually find it 
disagreeable). For the view from the fence allows one to see strengths and weaknesses on 
all sides of fence. 

And finally, rhetoricians have one ultimate advantage over others. In addition to their 
powers of observation, they can always leap down off the fence and assume a specific 
position (and therefore act if necessary). However, when they act, they do so knowing 
that all positions, including their own, inherently have weaknesses. They assume positions 
and pernaps act based on their weighing of advantages and disadvantages associated with 
the various possible positions. Their acts are always informed by systematic inquiry. 

The world would be a much finer and harmonious place if more of us would become 
rhetoricians- -and the ranks of rhetors were thinned! The world would be a more tolerant 



ERLC 



96

place, with more of us aware and understanding of the positions of others. Because we 
would see the weaknesses in our own position as well as the weaknesses of the 
"opposition," we would become more tolerant in general. And because we see all those 
weaknesses, we would be less rigid and dogmatic, and that certainly is valuable in this 
complex and ever-changing world. Let's make the world rhetoric(al)!

Crossing the River 



by 

Joy Deming 



As hard as I try, I can't seem to cross the river, even though I have tried several times this 
summer. I approach the river, but each time I back off. What is it with me? Have I buried 
it? Why can't I come to terms with the river of tears? When school began in August , I 
never thought this year would change my life so drastically, but it did. Therefore, it has 
been aa emotionally draining school year. 

The school year began as it routinely does with the endless round of meetings and in- 
service programs, which I can recite verbatim. But I am always anxious for the year to 
begin because only in teaching can I touch so many lives. It is always a challenge. Besides 
the summer had been wonderful because we had been able to go on several mini vacations 
and go see my parents three time,so I was more rested then ever and ready to teach. 

Before I knew it, the first six weeks had zoomed by. Where did it go? Time seems to 
escape me lately. Maybe I have been in the survival mode too long- - that is teach all day, 
go home, fix supper, wash clothes and do enough to survive the next day, fall in bed 
exhausted, repeat the same sequence the next day- the survival mode! How did I get here? 
Is it the aging process? How do I get out of it? 

As I pondered how to get out of this rut, I received word that my mother was to have 
exploratory surgery. She had found out this summer that she had adult on-set diabetes. 
During August she had attended Diabetic School and learned how to test her blood sugar 
and give herself insulin. I called her constantly during September and the first part of 
October. She told me her blood sugar was still high, and the doctor had continued to 
increase her insulin dosage. I begged her to get another opinion because the insulin should 
have brought her blood sugar down by now. But as many parents do, Mama dismissed me 
as she informed me she knew best about herself. Knowing Mama as I do, I could feel her 
scowl over the phone. "My doctor is one of the best in Mobile," she told me. I inferred 
from her statement what could I know I wasn't a doctor. When do parents realize that you 
are totally grown-up? Do they ever? But during that six weeks, I couldn't find the time to 
go see about Mama. 

With the news of the surgery, I immediatley went to Mobile, arriving Wednesday night 
before the Thursday morning surgery. After seeing Mama, I saw why my sister Judy was 
so concerned about her. Mama was high yellow- very jaundiced! The doctor had to find out 
about a spot on her pancreas. The first thing that popped into my mind was Michael 
Landon, who had recently died form cancer of the pancreas. My mind raced through the 
news accounts of his illness- no cure, too late when discovered, always terminal! All of 
this was confirmed the next day after Dr. Liden had operated. His diagnosis- cancer of the 
pancreas and liver, 3-6 months, make mama as comfortable as possible. 

Even with that devastating news we tried to go on. We expected to get Mama out of the 
hospital within five days. I stayed with her almost constantly trying to take care of her the 
best I could. As I piepared to return home, I realized that Mama was not improving, that 
she seemed worse. The four hour drive to Birmingham seemed endless. Why had I left? 
What is really important to me? Don't really know what I v/as thinking about- it wasn't 
clear nor logical probably because I cried the entire trip home. The emotions had to come

out. Before I arrived home the decision had been made- a leave of absence- leave my kids- 
yes- a leave of absence until what? I couldn't say it. 

' As it turned out, a former student had just graduated from Samford and agreed to take over 
my classes. By Wednesday I was back in Mobile. Mama was so very sick— more tests, 
more iv's, more antibiotics, more doctors. Then Dr. Liden said she needed surgery again. 
Two Major surgeries in less than twelve days. At first Mama said, 1 No-no more surgery." 
Daddy talked her into it, but the second surgery did not work well either. Some count with 
her liver was not going down. 

Finally ,after twenty-eight days in the hospital, Mama was released-the diagnosis maybe 
four weeks. So, my sister Judy and I moved in with Mama and Daddy. Her friends and 
family all came to see her and to offer fond farewells. How sad to be there and watch and 
listen to the loving goodbyes of so many people. 

But it was also a triumph to watch Mama continue to love, nurture, and support each 
family member and her friends, too. She found the strength to talk to each and every one. 
At this time she began some weird things, too. At night time she insisted that Judy and I 
tuck her and Daddy into bed. Of course, we had to help her, but it was somewhat strange 
turning our backs so Daddy could jump into bed without our seeing him. But now, as I 
look back, that nightly ritual was wonderful because Judy and I sat on the sides of the bed 
and talked to our parents - probably for the first time in our lives. It was the only peaceful 
time we had with Mama. 

Wednesday before Thanksgiving Mama woke up really sick. I went to work stabilizing her 
as I had been doing for over a month now. Even though Judy, Daddy, my brother Brent, 
and I were trying to help her, this morning was different. I had been on the phone with Dr. 
Davis, who told me this might be the end for her. Well, I didn't want to hear that. We had 
three to four weeks - he had promised. He also continued that I had signed papers stating 
that we agreed not to go to extreme measures to revive Mama. Never mind that I was not 
willing to let her go. 

However, Mama had her own ideas that morning. As I sat beside her, she said, "Oh Lord, 
I don't want to continue to be this sick. If I have to be this sick, please take me. 1 ' Within 
thirty minutes, Mama died, with me beside her crying, "Breathe, Mama, please breathe." 
The paramedics came but didn't go to extreme measures to revive her because of the 
cancer. The coroner and police came, too. Daddy, Judy, and Brent had all gone to pieces 
and could not help with anything. 

When the ambulance arrived to transport Mama to the funeral home, I realized my oldest 
brother Roy had locked himself in the the room with her and wasn't going to let them take 
her. I had to talk him into letting us in. I don't want all this responsibility. Besides, how 
do you let go of someone who has always been there for you? Especially the lady who 
picked you up time and time again, listened to you and still loved you, no matter what you 
had done. 

As I look back on that day, I realize that I could not give Mama the right to die. In my 
humanness I struggled - strived to keep her alive. Now I know in my heart that if we had 
revived Mama that day, it would only have been for her to die again later and that would 
have been cruel. So now with a better understanding and much love, I can let her go, and I 
can cross the river by myself. 

Bye, Mama.

who are doing time

of living too long. 

Prisoners lie 

in their cold green cells, 

behind iron bars 

of atrophy. 

Bellows echo 

through white ammonia halls, 

While a one-legged inmate 
wheels out in her electric chair. 
With a smoky voice she says, 
Tm so proud you came." 

She should have been paroled

Another one cries 

for something to sooth 

the thin burning lines; 

remnants of her cancerous lips. 

Soon 

these ice green walls 

will smell richly 

of mahogany and freedom.

The Limitations of the Label 



On a chilly November day, Anne Hutchinson boldly stepped away 
from an 1634 Massachusetts congregation to denounce its views on 
divine intervention. Her maverick spirit sparked rage among the 
colonists, and she was banned from the colony; later, both bhe and 
her children were killed by outraged Indians. 

Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered his hope for equality and 
liberation on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. to 
a peaceful gathering of civil rights activists. Five years and 
hundreds of speeches later, on April 4, 1968, he was assassinated by 
James Earl Jones. 

During the summer of 1991, Madonna ambitiously tours the 
globe clad in a metal bustier and men's trousers in the name of 
sexual freedom. Her flambouyant display of sexuality shocks both 
Western and Eastern audiences. By the completion of her Blonde 
Ambition Tour, she is banned from future performances in five major 
United States and Japanese cities. 

Although the focus of each story is different, Huthinson's 
honesty , King's hope and Madonna's sexuality, the person in each 
account has been labeled by society. The connotations of the label 
are positive, while the realities are not; society has tagged each an 
"individual." 

In our culture, individuality is marketed as a desirable goal 
that everyone should strive to achieve. Parents teach their children 
to lead, not follow; the poet Robert Frost implies the rewards of the 
road not taken. Although romantic, these aspirations do not include 
the realistic negativity accompanied with the label. For society to 
progress, however, risktakers, individuals, must be in place to 
instigate change. While many people want to be deemed 
"individuals," few are willing to accept the possible consequences. 

Artist Andy Warhol warned that individualism is a personal 
choice and adversity, and isolation are expected. Writer Henry David 
Thoreau in his book Walden cautioned his readers of the perils o' 
such an undertaking; individuals risk banishment from society by 
stepping away from it. But perhaps it was the French philosopher 



ERLC 



108 121 



Friedrich Nietzsche who best understood the exile; he often 
supressed his own individuality to prevent confinement. Warhol, 
Thoreau and Nietzsche experienced the ostracizing effects of 
individuality, a sad footnote on society's expectations. 

Meanwhile, flushed by an influx of media, the M.T.V. Generation, 
the youth of America stands idly by, half-heartedly attempting 
individuality. For them, the image is more significant than the 
embodiment. By purchasing and dressing in pseudo-nostalgic garb 
reminiscient of their slicker, hipper brothers, many young 
Americans ironically "buy" into the cultural phenomena of the 
Hippies. Although a few earnestly take to heart the issues of the 
movement, most see it as an image, an imitation of individuality, 
without the commitment. In much the same style, young African 
Americans don apparel blazoned with the emblem of Malcolm X: the 
bold white letter M X M symbolizing his desire to unite the black race. 
While many display his insignia in the name of peace, few 
understand his philosophies of race separation; they imitate others 
who embody individuality. Although developing role models is 
healthy, hiding behind them is not. For many people, not willing to 
risk banishment, it is much easier to travel the more beaten path 
than to take the path less taken. 

As society sends out its contradictory message: be an 
individual— but within limits-it negates the very essence of 
individuality. The youth of America, tomorrow's leaders, engulfed" by 
a society's negative response to individuality, meet their needs by 
embracing images, not becoming individuals. It is perhaps the 
natural progression as they view society's hostile response to its 
most courgeous members by realizing the limitations of the label.

SUMMER MISSION 73 

I think I was six when I first became aware of a group of dancers known as "The Golddiggers." 
What first began as an evening pastime of watching the girls perform on The Rich Little Show , later 
became a nightly ritual. My obsession went well beyond the envy most young girls feel for other prettier, 
shaplter girls. While I admired their long, glistening hair and their bell-bottomed psychedelic jumpsuits, 
these were not the objects of my desire. I coveted their boots: imitation leather, dyed, go-go boots with 
fantastically high heels and enormously large plastic zippers that crawled up the inside legs. 

I tried to pretend that I was a Golddigger by slipping into my rubber galoshes, the closest thing I 
had to boots. No luck. I even coupled them with a pair of Marcia Brady-reminiscent bell-bottoms. No 
luck. I was filled with despair; how could I possibly be a Golddigger if I did not have all of the proper 
accoutrements? At that very moment, in the depths of depression, I remembered seeing similar boots earlier 
in the winter at K-mart. It was summer now and the possibility of those boots still being at the store was 
about as likely as the possibility of my mother buying them for me. Then, in my most stubborn moment, 
my mission for the summer of 1973 became clear: GET THOSE BOOTS! 

Anyone not knowing my mother might think getting those boots would be an easy 
task; i.jwever, my mother 's fashion taste -boring- and mine -bold- clashed. I had to scheme, to sneakily 
coerce her into K-mart where my precious boots awaited their owner. Within a few days of my proclaimed 
mission, we headed to K-mart under the pretense of buying a friend's birthday present. Once inside, I bolted 
for the shoe department, breathlessly checking every aisle. No boots. My pul?c quickened to a frenzy as I 
saw my summer mission about to be aborted. Just as I had given up hope and sat , defeated, on the dirty K- 
mart floor, I saw, peeking out from under a clearance bin, a boot toe. Without hesitation I began to ravage 
through the shoes. I was a woman with a mission and nothing could stop me; I dug through loafers and 
pumps, sandals and slippers. Without warning, my hand felt something cold and slick. As if I were reeling 
in a marlin from the ocean, I pulled and tugged, rocked back and forth, and worked to free my precious 
catch. Finally, with a jar that sent me whirling backwards, I had my boots. Abh, my boots: foam-lined, 
pseudo-snakeskin vinyl boots with quarter inch heels and obnoxiously obvious zippers that slithered up the 
inside legs. I quickly pulled off my own childish Keds and replaced them with the more sophisticated 

123 

no 



boots. I stomped around not allowing the string attaching the boots to one another to hinder my 
performance. I could not wait to get them off and show my mother. She, however, did not share in my 
enthusiam. Any attempt to detail my heroic act of retrieving the boots from the depths of the clearance bin 
would have been met with a disapproving glare. Because being sensible would not work with my mother, 
maybe irrationality would; I threw myself on the floor and began to scream. My tantrum only 
strengthened my mother's defense. 

I hastily moved to Plan B: Daddy. I knew there were two things my father could not resist : (1) 
clever negotiations and (2) pouty lips. Within an hour, my father had relumed me to K-mart to purchase 
my Blue Light Special boots. I put them on in the car and proudly marched into the kitchen where my 
mother s continuing disapproving gaze fell upon them. She despised the boots and secretly harbored a desire 
to leave them out for the garbage men to haul away. I pledged from that day forward I would never let my 
boots leave my sight. 

However, tilings are usually said easier than they are done, and keeping my prized possession with 
me at all times was my quest and my mother's chagrin. I was allowed to wear them inside the house 
during Thr. Rich Little Show. I danced and pranced in front of the television, tossing my hair and kicking 
my bell-botttomed, booted legs high into toe air until finally I collapsed, exhausted. When it was time for 
bed, I did not want to take my boots off; in fact, I refused to remove them. Rather than argue , and because 
it was summer, my mother allowed me to keep them on until I fell asleep. This nightly ritual continued 
for weeks; not one day passed when I was not sporting my boots. 

My mother had grown accustomed to them. She stopped arguing with me when I put them on to 
wear to the store or down the street to see a friend. In fact, I thought she had forgotten about them and I 
once even tried wearing them to church. That was when her wrath, the one that had reared its ugly head 
earlier that summer, reappeared. She forbid the boots at church. I was crushed; ho- • could all my church 
friends know how sophisticated I really was if they could not see me wearing them? 

There are ways to get around the rules without really breaking them. Vacation bible school and 
church were different and I reasoned that wearing them there would not be disobeying my mother. One 
fateful moming, I packed them into my bag and sneaked them off to camp with me. As soon as my 



ierJc 



111 



124 



mother's Country Squire was well down the road, I pulled them out and slipped them on. I was the fashion 
plate of the playground. All day 1 jumped rope, danced, kicked, and skipped while wearing them. My 
mistake, however, was attempting the monkey bars in quarter inch heels. Just as I was about to make my 
descent from the Crazy Eight bars, my foot missed the bar below and I was sent to the dusty ground. My 
pride was not injured, I was. The fall had not only broken the heel of one of my beautiful boots, but my 
ankle as well. 

By the time my mother had returned to the church, what was at first anger had turned to 
compassion; her scornful grimace had been replaced with a warm, comforting smile. She lifted me into the 
car, delivered me to the doctor and returned me home without mention of the boots. After a few days of 
recuperation I became curious about my shoes and began to search for them. I dared not ask my mother 
about them for she had not punished me for disobeying and I owed her one. 

Weeks later, I found out she had thrown them away. I felt as if I had lost a good 
friend rather than a S5.50 pair of snakeskin, calf-high, vinyl go-go boots. I did not care that the heel was 
broken off or that the zippers were held up by white medical tape; those things only made them physically 
inferior. Wearing my boots made me feel special, sophisticated and I did not care about their appearance. 
My summer mission of 1973 had been successfully completed.

DESPERATE CITY 



It is 4 a.m. in the city. No one is about. The rising smog filters over the dimly lit 
city and the air begins to swelter with the dampness of humidity. The sleeping city will 
soon awaken from the serene quietness only to view a complicated, destitute place of 
crime, trouble, and crowdedness. It will awaken from peacefulness only to sadly see 
homeless, starving people sleeping in cramped corners on the street, digging into filthy 
trash cans desperately hoping to find a morsel of food, begging for money from strangers 
only to purchase another drop of alcohol. The dimly lit morning covers these troubles until 
the rising of the revelational sun which brings all things into view. The light will bring 
about the hustle and bustle of everyday life where the working class hurries to their places 
of employment only to be frustratingly caught up in the daily traffic jams with the loud, 
irritating sounds of angry horns and the increasing smog and pollution from exhaust pipes 
filling the already filthy air. 

A dog ferociously barks while his blind owner is attacked, mugged, and assaulted 
in broad daylight on the busy streets of the city, and no one offers to help. A child cries 
loudly as it hopelessly wanders the uncaring streets, desperately seeking her father who is 
lost in the crowd. A gunshot is heard and sirens soon follow as well as red and blue lights 
from police, paramedics, and fire engine vehicles. An elderly couple lay helpless in a pool 
of blood in their meat and vegetable market, having been brutally shot in the head and in 
the heart by a teenage drug addict who escaped the scene after stealing the money from the 
cash drawer. 

As the long, drudging day comes to an end, the darkness again covers the scenes 
of the city, but only for a while until the light returns for another day of disaster. The 
defenseless city struggles to breathe so that it may hopelessly make it through yet another 
depressing and devastating day.

"We can do it. We can do it," 

shout Clinton and Gore. 
The democrats are fighting to 

push republicans out the door. 
Revitalization of America 

is what they shout. 
About that, Clinton and Gore 

have no doubt. 
A New Covenant. A vision. 

A future for us all. 
Democratic Dreams 

closed inside four walls. 
Visual Images 

Encircled about the dark, clammy room 

a tinge of light ever so pale and wane 

mesmerized and encompassed my mind. 
Darker than before^but lighter than yesterday 

the closed-in space seemed an ephemeral image, 

but one that would forever remain a memory. 
Disturbing visions pounded their way into the dark space ; 

only to remain an unanswered mystery 

that would dauntfully haunt through eternity. 
The courage is undefined and unknown, 

the knowledge limited and mystical. 
Unity is ever present and piercing. 
Remembrance is eternally mine. 

Blood and Roses 

Scarlet red drops 

descending upon each innocent white petal 
From the puncture of a biting thorn 

that wounded human flesh 
Drip, drop, blend, and mix 

a blush of sinful red 
It is deep and piercing 

tc the heart 

to the soul 

to the mind . . . 



Desintegration is coming 

Moving quickly down the path. 
It's taking everything with it 

Including time, nature, and wrath. 
It has a way of swallowing 

All things both great and small. 
Desintegration is coming 

Bringing with it a broken dark wall. 
Time is of importance 

To save our home that's so dear. 
Please take all possible precautions 

Because desintegration is here. 



Black Space 

Look into the deep side. 

Look into the dark side. 

Mystical, mysterious,and maddening 

Look not from the inside, 

But only from the outside. 

For you might get lost 

In the darkness of it all.

"I still believe in a place called Hope." - Governor Bill Clinton 



Friday afternoon I sat in my living room, watching presidential candidate Bill 
Clinton as he addressed the Democratic Convention and the people of America. The 
auditorium in New York was filled with democrats from all over the place. They proudly, 
and some rather obnoxiously, displayed their patriotic colors of red, white, and blue. The 
Americans vivaciously cheered Governor Clinton on as he laid out his future hopes, 
dreams, and plans for this country. 

"It's time for a change in America. . . . This election is about putting people first," 

he said. 

Change, change, change is the biggest issue in this election it seems. The people 
want a change for the better, but when it comes right down to it, they always seem to stick 
with what they already have. If the truth be known, Americans are scared of change. 
Clinton says, "Our people are pleading for a change, but government is in the way. . . . We 
have got to give our people the kind of government they deserve: a government that works 
for them." 

"Jobs. Education. Healthcare. These are not just commitments from my lips. 
They are the work of my life. . . . Our priorities must be clear: we will put our people first 
again. Together we will revitalize America," bellowed Clinton. 

I'll be the first to admit that the governor's "New Covenant," as he has called it, 
excited me and played on my emotions. As I listened and as I watched, I heard and I saw 
Americans uniting for a cause that they believed in. I felt the unity of those people in the 
New York convention center while I was sitting alone in my own living room. Why can't 
Americans unite like this every day? 

Clinton made a strong point on this issue when he said, "Tonight every one of you 
knows deep in your heart that we are too divided. It is time to heal America. . . . We need 
each other. All of us, we need each other. We don't have a person to waste." Good 
point, I say, but will this unity ever come to pass and become a part of history? 

The governor said that "a president ought to be a powerful force for progress." 
Following this statement, he gave the incumbent president some advice: "And, so I say, 
George Bush: If you won't use your power to help America, step aside. I will. ... Our 
country is falling behind. The president is caught up in the grip of a failed economic 
theory. . . . And for most Americans, Mr. President, life's been a lot less kind and a lot 
less gentler than it was before your administration took office." 

His point here, you ask? Well that was his next move. "Al Gore and I can do 
better. We can do better." He told the America people, "Join us, work with us, win with 
us and we can make our country the country it was meant to be." Sounded easy to me. 
What about you? 

Clinton's "New Covenant" seemed to be the key ingredient in his place called 
Hope. His covenant, you ask? "A solemn agreement between people and their 
government based not simply on what each of us can take, but what all of us must give to 
our nation." 

More specifically, he and Al Gore were offering Americans "a new choice based on 
old values." He stated that this New Covenant "asks us to be Americans again. Old- 
fashioned Americans for a new time. Opportunity. Responsibility. Community. When 
we pull together, America will pull ahead. When we are united, we are unstoppable." 

His next move was one of the strongest points he made and a really effective one 
emotionally. He brought the people into his responsibilities by saying,"But I can't do this 
alone. No president can. We must do it together. It won't be easy and it won't be quick. 
We didn't get into this mess overnight, and we won't get out of it overnight. But we can 
do it. With commitment, creativity, diversity, and drive, we can do it." He then had the 
responsive chant of the people in the crowd saying, "We can do it. We can do it. We can 



ERLC 



12S 

115 



do it." As the cameras scanned the crowd, I saw people of all races united, holding hands, 
working together. 

According to Governor Clinton, his plan is different and new and he believes it will 
work. He's wrapped up in a vision . "Where there is no vision, the people parish," he 
quoted from the Bible. "I hope you don't have to begin tomorrow without a vision," he 
said. He believes that the reason his plan will work is due to the vision. "It will work 
because it's rooted in the vision and values of the American people," he stated. 

In conclusion, he invited the American people to "reach out and join us in a great 
new adventure to chart a bold new future." After such an emotional, breath-taking speech, 
who wouldn't want to jump on and take a ride? 

The concluding atmosphere of the convention center was even more intriguing. As 
the song "Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow" by Fleetwood bellowed over the sound 
system, people all over the building sang, danced, and held hands. It was a picture of 
unity that was almost indescribable. Governor Clinton and his family, Senator Al Gore 
and his family, and hundreds of keynote speakers filled the platform singing, hugging, 
holding hands, uniting. 

Bill Clinton recruited me into believing in his place called Hope. I can only say that 
it's possibly a Utopia, an ideal that may be impossible to achieve, realistically anyway. But 
I'll continue to believe in that place; otherwise, what is there to look forward to?

Dark Outlet II 



The dark space is real small, 

but you can crawl through 

with your eyes. 
When inside you can peer out, 

but you're still in the dark. 
I think the darkness stretches 

down a cold path really far 

and goes into infinity. 
You have to walk slowly 

because you may stumble 

or fall to the ground, 

wherever it may be. 
You won't be alone here; 

there are others present, 

but their presence is not felt. 
If you want to return to the light 

you must turn around and run, 

because the darkness will trap you 

never to return . . . 

I Saw the Moon Tonight 

I saw the moon tonight 

on my solemn drive home. 
It sat upon the low distorted mountains 

against the black whispering sky. 
I saw the moon tonight 

on my solemn drive home. 
It hung so low in the sky 

I'm sure I could have touched it 

from the mountaintop. 
I saw the moon tonight 

as the charcoal clouds passed over it. 
It cried tears of bloody beige; 

an eerie picture it surely gave. 



When returning to the light 

your soul will feel shock, 
Not because of the light 

but because you still feel darkness. 
Once you've made that trip 
you do not recover 
the peacefulness of light. 
Though the darkness did not trap you 

in the small space, 
It trapped you upon leaving. 
You didn't run . . . 



Crying in the Rain 

The sky is grey, dark, and gloomy. 
The clouds all run together 

into one big haze. 
The sun cannot find its way 

out of this complicated maze. 
I look out my window 

at this picture that I see. 
I realize I could go out there 

and carry my emotions with me. 
Yes, that would be perfect - 

crying in the rain. 
I walk out into the midst of it 

and slowly release the pain. 
There is no umbrella, 

no coverage for me. 
There is only the sky and the rain 

and the tears flowing freely. 
As my tears progress, 

the rain starts to pour. 
Pounding, pounding, pounding 

till you think there'd be no more. 
My tears mix with the rain 

and seem slowly to release pain. 
The rain slowly stops 
as my tears do too. 
This hour has been comforting, plain - 
just to walk alone . . . 
crying in the rain.

A WORLD OF OPPORTUNITIES 



I always wanted to be a teacher, i admit that as a child I did 
spend hours in my room teaching my dolls. They were carefully 
lined up in front of my chalkboard and I dutifully taught my lessons 
as they stared at me blankly, all of us waiting for the magic word 
that would bring them to life I didn't see myself as a full-time 
schoolteacher, though i was certain to have to share my teaching 
career with my acting career or possibly the ballet I also 
moonlighted with a variety of small businesses, each of which a 
very promising future in itself I catch myself at times dreaming 
of these past careers and wonder if I took the right path. Usually 
these little bouts of indecision coincide with six weeks grades or 
particularly stressful days. 

My room often became a glamorous boutique wherein I could 
dress up in all of my finery and dress up my customers in their 
choice of my great aunfs hand-me-down high heels and evening 
dresses. A magnolia tree in the back yard became a quaint little 
cafe in which I served a variety of leaf burgers and rock soups 
Sometime later, real money was discovered and any endeavors had to 
include actual monetary exchanges. No problem. I could provide a 
product if my customer would supply the cash. Luckily I had a friend 
who, too, was interested in a prosperous future and who also had a 
great front yard for lemonade stands. 

Our greatest money making scheme came when we decided to 
sell rocks We actually thought there was a market for the selling 
of rocks. Now, these were not beautiful rocks, nor were they "pet 
rocks or "magic" rocks They weren't even clean rocks. They were 
literally rocks. We did, however, spend considerable amounts of 
time selecting the perfect rocks to be peddled. I don't quite 
remember all the criteria for our rocks to have to be selected, but 
we carefully scrutinized every one before it went into the box 
We bravely took our prized rocks from door to door and despite a few 
minor rejections, managed to sell our selection of rocks. I think age 
was on our side as well as the uniqueness of the goods. Little old 
ladies would sweetly smile down on us and say, "Let me run get my 
pocketbook " 

It never dawned on us that when we made our millions we 
would need to include the rightful owners of the rocks. We mined 
our prized collection from a neighbor's driveway, never pondering 
the legalities of our actions

We worked hard and the money came in slowly, the whole 
scheme unknown to our parents Unfortunately, no one wanted to 
become repeat customers and our beautiful rocks soon lost their 
appeal. However, the disappointment was soon soothed as we got to 
take our hard-earned money to the G.C. Murphy nearby Candy was the 
usual choice, but we soon discovered make-up and had to own every 
flavor lip gloss available. I remember one distinctive bottle of light 
blue nail polish that I thought was the greatest. Nevermind that 
light blue nail polish never caught on, it matched my eyeshadow and 
it was mine. Obviously, my fashion sense was as keen as my 
business sense. 

With career options like these, I realize that I am best off in 
the classroom, regardless of stress-levels. I'll stay where I am and 
continue to try to find the magic words to bring my students to life

QL<Z9&1 



( What does it feet tike to the the child of a broken family? I can only guess from the 
perspective of one of the parents responsible for the breakup of our family unit. The decision to 
dissolve the marriage was made with careful consideration of the consequences for Qlenn during 
his formative years. Die was only a baby at the time, and the difficulty of that decision is as clear 
to me today as it was then. My main concern was that somehow I wanted to be sure that Qlenn 
grew up with a male role model, at the absence of his father. The choosing of this role model was 
not difficult. f What better role model could there ever be for Qlenn than my own, my father. I 
decided to return home. 

After struggling through the turmoil of lawyers, papers to sign, agreements to reach, and 
disagreements to mend, I bundled up my baby and the poodle my husband and I had shared from 
the beginning of our marriage and returned to a more comfortable environment, my home and 
my own parents. 

^Determined to be independent 'as soon as possible during this new phase of my life, I set 
out to find a teaching position and an apartment for Qlenn and me. We spent as much time as 
we could with my parents, especially when -Dad got home at plight. Patiently, he gave Qlenn the 
guidance, love, and masculine ways I had hoped he would. 

Time went on and Qlenn and I did become independent. 9dy 'Dad provided the male 
influence I had hoped for, but, as it turned out, he was not the only male that wanted influence. 
Qlenn s father began to take an interest in Qlenn and arranged for xnsitations at least once a year. 
The first, I will never forget. Qlenn was only two years old and his father came to Oklahoma 
where we were living to take Qlenn back, to Florida for a two Week^visit. Only another mother 
could really understand the devastation I felt as I saw my tittle boy, dressed up in his sailor suit, 
holding his 'Dad's hand, but looking back^at me with an 7 don't understand' look, in his eyes. 

!As the years went on and Qlenn began to grow, he became less verbal about his trips to 
Florida. lAs much as I tried to get him to discuss the problems involved with being a part of two 
famUies, he was very sUent and evasive. As a mother, I wanted to help him deal with conflicting 
ideas that I knew existed for a transient between two very different families and lifestyles. 
CHaving been advised not to ever spea&n a derogatory manner about his father, I was careful to 
find only good things to say, and believe me, early in the divorce, that was difficult. I was not 
sure, however, that his father would have adhered to the same advice and that there was a strong 
possibUity he was defacing my abUities as a mother in front of my son. I never felt, however, 
that I should openly address the issue with Qlenn, but his withdrawal from me after trips to 
Florida caused me great concern. 

Qlenn's dad had remarried shortly after our divorce, and apparently as a result, problems 
began to develop in the relationship of Qlenn and his stepmother. *When Qlenn was eight years 
old, after one of his Florida xnsits, he came into my bedroom, laid down on the bed, and ask^d me 
why I had put his dad in jaU. Frantically trying to reach some understanding of what he was 
asking me, I responded with, 0( What do you mean?' Ole preceded to tell me that his stepmother 
had accused me of sending his dad to jail, and as his story continued about the things I had and 
had not done, he cried profusely. I held him close, confused myself by his statements, and tried to 
make some sense out of what he was saying. I tried to explain delicately about the early months 
of the divorce when we experienced some controversy over chUd support payments, but assured 



136 BEST COPY AVAILABLE 



him that they were easily resolved and definitely did not result in his father s incarceration. Other 
attacks his stepmother had made were on my mothering skills and were not even worth 
addressing. 

One question led to another, and then came, the clincher. '(Mom, why did you and my 
dad get a divorce?' I Cooked down at that tittle tears tained face, surround th doubts that had 
apparently festered within him for years. I suppose I had known the ^ .^stwn woxdd appear at 
some point, But I was not prepared, realizing the impact my answer might have on him. 

'Money,' I said, 'Jour father and I were very young when we married. We loved each 
other very much but were not old enough to realize how different our goals and desires were. 
'When you were born, your father was putting everything he had into mating money, his life 
goal. I had goals, too, especially for our family, but my goals included a father for you that 
would have time for little league games, open houses at school, and school plays. Tor me, I 
wanted a husband who would be a support to me as a mother and in my ou/n endeavors for my 
career. As time went on and your father became more involved in his worki he and I grew apart. 
I decided, for you and me, that it might be best to divorce and try to fulfill the goals I considered 
important for us. Qlenn, I didn't know then and I don't know now whether you agree with my 
decision, but at the time, it seemed to be the best alternative. 9(pw, what you need to understand 
is only that we both love you very much and want what's best for you.' Qlenn listened 
attentively, saying very little. 

The years havefloxon by. I found a stepfather for Qlenn who was everything I wanted 
for him and me. Tie coached Qlenn through tittle league, advised and supported him in his 
decisions in high school, and loved him as his own. Tie slao loved and supported me in everything 
I have wanted to do. 

Qlenn matured and began to see the differences between his natural father and me. Tie 
accepted the two lifestyles he was exposed to, one full of material things and one full of mostly 
love and support, and learned to survive in. both quite well. After our talfi that time when he was 
eight, he began to open up a tittle more about what he was feeling, and the adults involved began 
to handle the sharing of him more maturely. Qlenn's natural father began to appreciate what 
Qlenn's stepfather was providing for Qlenn and as a result, he began.to devote more quality time 
to Qlenn during his visits. Tlis wife and Qlenn continued to have some ups and downs over the 
years, but Qlenn, as he matured, tried to keep things as amiable as possible and, consequently, 
developed a real ability to 'kpep the peace.' 

Qlenn is twenty-four years old now and has been blessed with the best of two families, 
after enduring and surviving the worst. Tie has two brothers and two sisters from the two 
families, who sum to adore him. "Both families share and take pride in accomplishments. Tie 
looks to both families for advice. Tlis own goals, on one had, resemble his natural father's, but 
his values reflect those of his stepfathers and mine. Tie wants to makf> money, but not at the 
sacrifice of home and family. Ttow he accomplished both, remain to be seen.

My Peter Pan 



It was as an elementary school child that I first encountered Mary Martin's Peter Pan on 
TV. As I trampolined on my bed-shouting "I can fly!"~I had no idea that this fantasy 
character would one day enter my home in the real flesh-and-blood form of my three-year- 
old son, Jamie. 

Oh, things started out innocently enough, all right. My in-laws took Jamie to see "Disney 
on Ice." That year— as you may have guessed— this extravaganza recreated the story of 
Peter, complete with glittering, colorful sets and a cast of over a hundred. From that point 
on, Peter made himself a full-time permanent guest in not only my home, but in the homes 
of Jamie's grandmothers, who babysat during the week. 

Peter first appeared in our family through the Walt Disney animated feature that Neil, my 
mother-in-law, bought for Jamie. With this addition came the need (or should I say 
demand) for new equipment, and lots of it. For Jamie was not content just to watch Peter 
Pan. Oh no— he had to live, breathe, and BE Peter Pan. First of all came plastic swords 
with which he fought pirates and the notorious Captain Hook. When the animated Peter 
fought Hook, Jamie fought Hook, too, right in our own living room. When Peter lunged 
with his sword, Jamie lunged with his. And when Peter pirouetted into a fancy fencing 
maneuver, Jamie effortlessly followed suit. My son had family members fast forward or 
rewind the video to the fighting scenes. 'Til fight you man-to-man, with one arm behind 
my back!" and "Do you yield?" became watchwords for our little actor. Art, Jamie's dad, 
was continually drawn into these man-to-man confrontations, as An was forced by the 
ever-more-forceful new Peter into playing Hook. Needless to say, they went through 
numerous plastic swords. 

Peter also visited us in costume. Jamie couldn't just act like his hero-he had to look like 
him, too. The first stage was the paper hat, complete with paper feather. Nan-Nan, my 
mother, became the hat maker for Jamie. Fighting is rough business, so he went through 
several hats in one day. Of course, he also lost a few in transit from babysitter to 
babysitter. And since he couldn't watch or be Peter without his hat, Nan-Nan became 
awfully busy. In desperation, she finally made Jamie a hat out of green felt. A steady 
supply of red pipe cleaners became his feathers, which led us to yet another stage in my 
son's obsession. The feathers were very important, because they had to be "just so," and 
the "just so" was according to Jamie's whim. Sometimes his feather had to point 





ERIC 



backwards at a forty-five degree angle, and at other times it had to point straight up, and I 
do mean straight. Jamie often stood in front of our full length mirror, turning his head 
from side to side to check the angle of the feather, and running his open palm from the 
bottom of the feather to its point to make sure it was exactly straight. And woe to the man 
who messed with that pipe cleaner. "Don't bend my feather! " became yet another 
watchword as I hauled Jamie-complete with swords, daggers, VCR tape, and hats-to and 
from his grandmothers' homes. 

As Jamie's involvement with Peter grew more complex-as did his set of hats, tunics, 
swords, coloring books, and various VCR versions of the movie (four, to be exact, and 
that includes the one with Mary Martin)~I have to confess I got sick of Peter. Once one of 
my favorite stories, I finally got to the point that I wanted to shoot Mary Martin, Walt 
Disney~and, yes-my in-laws for carrying Jamie to that ice show in the first place. Heaven 
for me, at that point, would have been taking a package of red pipe cleaners, bending every 
last one of them, stomping on them, and then throwing them all away. I worried that 
Jamie's obsession was unhealthy and that he, like Mary Martin's Peter, would never "grow 
up." I hated Peter's irresponsibility. What was cute in a once-every-ten-years' viewing of 
these shows took on greater significance as my son embraced as his hero the boy who ran 
away from home, who wouldn't go to school, and "who wouldn't obey the silly rules." 

But here I am, I concluded as I stepped into the grade school office. And here Jamie would 
be all too soon. Kindergarten awaited him and the registration cards I now held in my 
hands. I looked forward to plays, music programs, and Christmas parties. I looked 
forward to new books, new lessons, and lunch boxes. I couldn't help but think now, 
however, that maybe Peter wasn't so bad after all. I found myself missing the pipe 
cleaners, felt hats, and yards of Scotch tape that Robin Hood toys had replaced more and 
more frequently of late. The boy who had shouted "I won't grow up!" was growing up, 
and there was nothing I could do about it. As much as I hated to admit it, my son was 
venturing into another world— a happy one— but nonetheless one where parents couldn't 
play. I was happy for him, but I was sorry for myself I knew, however, that no matter 
where he was headed and who he became, my son would always be my Jamie, my little 
Peter Pan. -Dorothy Ward

The Catch 



The waves lapped the sides of the boat as we stretched out in the sun. 

"Hey, look who's signed the guest book," yelled Robbie from inside the cabin. Jean and I 
got up to see. Ronald and Nancy Reagan, Gary Hart and Donna Rice, and several other 
celebrities' signatures were scrawled in the book. 

"This must be a famous boat," said Robbie, getting out his camera. 

"It ought to be for what it's costing," said Tom. 

We didn't care. It was worth every cent, this vacation at Acapulco Princess, complete with 
sailfishing. I tried to think of Hemingway's Old Man, but somehow this stark white fishing boat 
with two clean-looking deck hands and captain couldn't compare with the sun-withered old 
fisherman or his unlucky skiff. 

The shirtless deck hands, speaking almost no English, catered to our wishes, attune to 
making these Yankees' fishing trips as pleasant and effortless as possible. Methodically cutting 
bait and setting out rods, their own work seemed effortless. 

The captain slowed the boat, then almost shut down the engine. This signaled Robbie, a 
veteran saltwater fisherman, to cast his line. His tan, muscular frame shone against his dark, 
bushy hair. He could have passed for a deck hand. 

"Hey, I've got one!" he yelled after almost no time. In an instant, the deck hands helped 
him strap himself into the seat. We girls rushed out on the deck to watch the fight. The fish pulled 
heavily on the line as Robbie struggled to hold on. 
"Need some help?" offered Tom. 

"This one's gonna be mine. You can have the next," said Robbie. 

His arms bulged as he leaned back in his seat then reeled frantically with a forward lunge. 
Back and forth. Back and forth. The fight wore on. Perspiration dripped down his forehead 
despite the cool breeze. The rest of us felt the tension and subconsciously leaned back and forth in 
time. 

He stopped for a few seconds rest. Twenty minutes of never-slacking tension. 

"Want help?" Joe's and Tom's hands itched for a chance at the great fish. 

"Nope." Robbie went back to the lunge-and-reel routine. The deck hands stood back, 
gaff in hand, obviously impressed with the Yankee's skill. 

The waves broke suddenly and shot up a huge blue body arching gracefully above the 
surface about fifty feet behind us. A long, white sail spread down its back, then it dropped back 
into a crest of white. 

The captain looked down from his deck and maneuvered the boat for the best angle. 
"Now comes the tough part " he offered. Thirty minutes had ticked away, and Robbie was tiring. 
He continued his lunge-and-ieel. 

"How big do you think it is?" asked Janet. 

"Looks like about eight feet," said Jean. We tried to stay out of the way but watched for a 



glimpse of the great creature. 

The great catch jumped a few more times as its life drew shorter and shorter toward the 
boat. Its grace tugged at its captors. 

"What will we do with it?" asked Jean. 

"Let's take a picture and let it go," suggested Janet. 

"No, it will die anyway now," said Tom, still wringing his hands to get in on the action. 
"Then can we mount it?" 

"It'll cost about $1000 to mount it and send it back." 
"Well, let's let it go and give it a chance." 

The fish jumped again just a few feet from the boat. Robbie reeled furiously. The deck 
hands readied the gaff. One reached down and picked up a wooden club. 
"What's he going to do?" Jean eyed the cruel instruments. 
"They'll have to knock him out to handle him," said Joe. 

"Oh, don't club him!" said Jean. The fish stopped fighting for a moment, giving Robbie a 
much needed respite. Forty-five minutes. His arms and back ached; his white knuckles clenched 
the rod. He reeled deliberately, slowly pulling up the great fish. 

The deck hands poised at the boat's edge. The rest of us stood back and watched, 
helpless. The surface broke. A deck hand lunged the gaff and missed. Another thrust and he 
hooked the side and began pulling in the fish. A second gaff, a second hook, and the two men 
skillfully pulled up the trophy. Tom unstrapped Robbie and all the guys rushed back to help pull 
up the great weight. They heaved it up onto the back of the boat. It flopped madly. A deck hand 
held up the deadly club. 

"No!" yelled Jean. 

"Club him!" yelled Joe, struggling to hold down the long bill. 
"Club him!" joined the other guys. 

The club fell. The fish shook. The victors pulled their catch over the side. 

Its proud side shone an iridescent blue and turquoise and silver. Its silver belly quivered, 
then trickled red from the triangular scar on its side. A quick measure proved it to be nine feet four 
inches long. 

Janet focused the camera as the guys rolled their trophy to hide the scars. Robbie proudly 
spread the sail and gave the victor's smile. 

The deck hands lashed down the trophy, hosed the deck, and cut bait for the next cast. The 
guys waited anxiously for the captain's signal. The girls stretched back out in the sun, as Jean 
shielded her eyes from the stinging wind.

Sweet Milk and 
Summer feeder* 

On clearing the pasture in June 

Summer pregnant momma 
can outpull us girls together 
and stack the weed 
for little ones 
to carry. 

Bareheaded summer children 
load Western Auto wagon 
and haul the summer seeder 
to dry and burn 
tomorrow. 

Endless summer seeder 
Hours drag on till noon. 
Momma calls us in for dinner, 
wash up and sit 
for blessing. 

Butter and sugar sandwiches 
taste good by blowing fans. 
Iced coffee cools me off inside; 
the young ones drink 
their milk. 

Slow summer afternoon 
Lying crossways on the bed 
while Momma reads of Joseph 
Just till the young ones sleep/ 
she says. 

Soothing summer sleeping 
float on quilts of many colors 
with butter and sugar sandwiches, 
iced coffee and 
sweet milk.

To Lauren 

(Reflections on Picasso's "The Gourmet") 

Borrowed napkin drapes the neck, 
covering the Sunday dress from spills. 
Standing on the curved stool 
the young girl stirs and dips 
with determined chin and blushing 
cheeks. 

Muted yellows, greens, and blue 

shadows 
smooth curved shapes of table, 
dress, drape and archway, 
where mother's candle flickers faintly. 
Mellow light shines on the young girl's 
face 

and hair - not golden or secre .ive black - 
but contented brown. 
Contented eyes speak of grown-up 
helping, 
and the secret 
of stolen bites.

A Doll Named Lucy 

byPatWillett 



There has hardly been a time in my life that I don't remember having my doll Lucy. 
She was given to me by my first teacher, the lady who owned "Miss Lucy's 
Kindergarten". . . a person whose face I can't recall, but who gave me a lifelong gift of 
love through a doll's face. 

My parents were poor, and my mother worked at a time when most women stayed 
home to raise their children. Miss Lucy was the traditional old maid schoolteacher who 
kept a school in her home, and I stayed with her during the day. She apparently had a real 
affection for me because it was from her that I received my doll Lucy when I was four 
years old. 

My doll Lucy was my rescuer. She and I went everywhere together. Her beautiful 
papier-mache face was sweetly painted with a permanent rosebud smile. Her two perfect, 
tiny teeth never knew a dentist drill. Short, full lashes fringed cerulean blue glass eyes that 
saw only the world I wanted her to see. 

I read to her, danced with her, sang to her. 

We played 'library 1 and 'school' together. 

Even though she couldn't be heard by grownups (except for crying a mechanically 
plaintive "ma-ma" when I'd bend her over my lap), she and I carried on complete 
conversations. 

She comforted me when Id cry about my daddy acting ugly when he'd been 
drinking. 

She told me I was her friend. 

We made grass tea together and drank it out of acorn cups. 

I even gave her baths, tho' with eventually damaging results because her plump 
muslin body was stuffed and her adorable dimpled arms and legs were painted. 

As her toes and fingers crumbled slowly away due to my well-intentioned 
ministrations, I pretended that she had the leprosy I was so childishly terrified of after 
reading about it in the Bible. I felt enormous guilt over hurting my most beloved friend, 
but Lucy never seemed to mind, 

I played with her until I was almost thirteen. Then high school and college took 
over my life. I never even noticed when Lucy no longer was in my room. 

Time has a way of coming around again. When my daughter, Ginger, was born, 
my mother surprised me one day by opening up a dusty clothbound trunk stored in a dim 
corner of her basement and bringing out my doll Lucy. Mother thought I might want Lucy 
for Ginger. 

"No, Mother, she's mine!" And I, a grown woman, wept as I cradled a long-lost 
friend in my arms. 

Lucy now reposes on the same clothbound trunk, outfitted in a dainty, baby-sized 
christening dress whose long batiste fullness covers her battered feet and wearing a 
berufflcd bonnet that conceals her damaged head. She still smiles at me every morning as I 
arise and continues to give me her unconditional love.

Images 

by Pat Willett 

The image in the mirror of the confident, happy woman I am is vastly different 
from the insecure, anxious twelve-year-old that I was when I began my freshman year in 
high school. My biggest goal then was to be accepted. Social acceptance meant, to my 
way of thinking at that time, belonging to a sorority. And that meant having the "right" 
clothes. 

In my family, clothes were carefully purchased for specific needs: church, school, 
or party. Castoff clothes were for play. 

That particular fall, in a sudden burst of self-confidence, I'd cut apart a hand-me- 
down pinafore from a stylish older cousin and lovingly redesigned it into what I saw as a 
romantically full skin like the gypsies wore that camped in the vacant lot that I passed by on 
my way to high school. The skirt's grey cotton background was splattered with a perky 
white and yellow daisy design. I'd let out the hem and trimmed it in a lavish white eyelet 
ruffle. I thought it was the cutest outfit I'd ever made, and it became my favorite play 
outfit. 

It was the end of a school week. I had changed into playclothes: the gypsy skirt, 
combined with a particularly colorful coral pink blouse trimmed in acid green stitching. 
When my mother, with my younger brother in tow, indicated we were going out for 
awhile, there was no reason to change. It was only later, in some dreary rented rooms 
replete with bare lightbulbs dangling on cords from the ceilings, that I found out that my 
mother had again separated from my father because of his continued drinking. To my 
horrified astonishment, she had taken advantage of one of his drunken stupors and walked 
us away with only the clothes on our backs. 

I remember my mother's sadness and my fury. I could not believe what she 
expected of me - to wear the play outfit I had on to school the next week! My mother's 
tears were not half the angry ones I shared at my prideful predicament. Playclothes just 
could not be worn to high school - and a gypsy skirt - NEVER! 

The popular high school image for girls meant wearing a cashmere sweater set 
topped with an angora collar, a pleated plaid skirt, and polished penny loafers worn with 
two or three pairs of socks cuffed thickly together. Although I'd pestered my mother into 
the requisite angora collar, Yd had to be satisfied with a woolen sweater and a homesewn 
skirt. When I wore the outfit, I fervently hoped that I looked like the girls in the Dixie 
Debs, one of those elite sororities that - wonder of wonders - was rushing me for 
membership. It was vital that I gained their approval. That was not, however, one of my 
mother's priorities that emotionally agonizing week. 

When Monday arrived, I rode the early bus to school to avoid friends and 
explanations. Humped over my books, I walked bitterly through the now seemingly, 
unendingly long halls and virtually cringed when the girls from the Dixie Debs would stop 
to chat with me. I absolutely hated my mother and blamed her for my embarrassment. 
That there was more at stake than a change of clothes never entered my immature mind. 

In addition I constantly worried that I would stain the now thoroughly detested, 
once adored gypsy play outfit. This meant wearing only a slip and undergarments after 
school and being confined to the depressing rooms where Mother had located us. To add 
further insult to injury, it also meant being dressed (or undressed) this way in front of my 
unsympathetic ten- year-old brother who saw the whole situation as an adventure. 

For almost a week, a very long week, I wore those clothes. On the fifth day of 
our self-imposed exile, my mother and father reconciled, and we returned home. 

I conveniently tore the blouse on a nail and spilled nail polish on the gypsy skirt, 
thus relegating it to the rag bag. When the Dixie Debs blackballed me, I was sure it was 
because I'd worn the same tacky outfit for so many days in a row. I guess Fll never know 
if the Dixie Debs would have accepted me if only I'd been able to accept myself.

The Jumping Off Place 

by Pat Willett 



In a popular movie a few years ago, the archaeologist-explorer stares across an 
abyss to a cave that contains a valuable treasure. Trusting to what he has learned, he makes 
a leap of faith into space to find that he does not fall. A bridge, hidden to all but the 
enlightened, exists to safely cross the abyss to the treasure on the other side. 

As a teacher, I'm like the archaeologist, researching, always looking for ways to 
reach my students - my teaching treasure. The search began when I altered my perception 
of what is teaching. 

Several years ago, I heard about the Bay Area Writing Project due to a graduate 
level course that I was taking. The professor enthusiastically shared what was happening in 
the teaching of writing. I learned about the research of Donald Graves and Lucy Calkins. 
This was my introduction to whole language. 

I'd already experienced frustration as a middle school teacher some twenty years 
earlier. This time, as I reentered the teaching profession, I vowed to make a difference, to 
find a better path. There wasn't much available on whole language and the writing process 
for upper grades. I adapted what I read to fit my needs. 

Devising 'nutshell' lessons was one of my first "leaps" and was based on students' 
grammar needs. The grammar textbook became a reference tool, and I sought to stay away 
from fragmented exercises. During the next few years, my students kept asking for more 
writing, collaborating with me on plans and ways to evaluate their pieces. 

My quest had gone too far to turn back. I had begun to realize that a writing student 
is a learning student. 

Other treasure finders gave me encouragement: 

In Active Voices, James Moffett wrote that "...writing is the external expression 
of the inner thought..." 

Nancie Atwell provided me with the teacher's responsibility in the writing 
workshop approach in her book, In The Middle , when she stated that "...the (writing) 
workshop uniquely accommodates junior high students.. .(and)... provides a structure that 
keeps them on track and an authoritative adult model with whom they can discover the 
sense of reading and writing." 

When I applied for the Samford University Writing Project, I was as anxious as the 
archaeologist wondering if the experts in the field will agree with his findings. Being 
accepted into the project meant that I was no longer alone in my treasure search. My 
expedition was provided with experienced field guides and resources to sustain me. They 
were there when I asked for help, when I stumbled over new ground, or when my own 
map's directions were vague, as well as to cheer me on in my progress. 

My meandering path of words, sentences, and paragraphs has grown less dense. 
I've been given a research-based compass to stay oriented to writing with meaning.The 
teaching bridge has been in view all the time - just camouflaged by tradition and rhetoric. 

It isn't that I've learned to teach; I can teach. The writing project has involved me 
in my own learning, in recognizing that the treasure is truly inside me just as it is in each of 
my students, and is real everytime I hold a pen in my hand. I have been given time to 
think, to make choices, to write. Writing to learn, not learning to write; this is the power 
of the project. Teachers do what their students could be allowed to do, and using this 
insight, guide students in discovering ownership of their written thoughts. 

Now I know how to find the treasure. The way is clearly marked through the 
Samford University Writing Project for another to reach the jumping off place, and 
trustingly, to make a leap of faith.
