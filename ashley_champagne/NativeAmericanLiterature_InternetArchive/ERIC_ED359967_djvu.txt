PREFACE 



In 1978, Mary Choncoff compiled 
ARIZONA IN BOOKS FOR CHILD- 
REN, a listing of more than 550 titles 
of fiction and non-fiction in-print 
books. This bibliography was 
published by the Arizona Department 
of Education where Ms. Choncoff 
served as Director of ESEA title IV-B, 
Libraries and Learning Resources 
Department. A number of biblio- 
graphies have been published since 
1978 that contain Arizona materials for 
children, but no comprehensive list 
that would update Ms. Choncoff's 
work has been attempted. ARIZONA 
HERITAGE provides a much needed 
update. 

ARIZONA HERITAGE: A BIBLIO- 
GRAPHY OF MATERIALS AND 
DIRECTORY OF AUTHORS, 
ILLUSTRATORS AND STORY- 
TELLERS FOR TEACHERS, LIB- 
RARIANS AND PARENTS is a listing 
of resources about Arizona for 
children in kindergarten through 
eighth grade. Materials include fiction 
and non-ficiion and are mostly English 
language titles. Books listed have 
been published since 1977 with two 
notable exceptions. A group of classic 
titles that are distinguished by literacy 
or artistic merit and are currently in 
print have been included and are 
noted with an asterisk. The second 
exception is our section of biblio- 
graphies. The compilers acknowledge 
that a rich and vast portion of Arizona 
heritage is recorded in Spanish and/ 
Native American language materials: 
Excellent bibliographies have been 
compiled in these areas and are among 
those listed in this section. 



We have made no attempt to indicate 
if books are currently in print or if 
audio-visual materials are available 
for purchase as this status changes 
quickly. It is hoped that many of these 
materials can be found in Arizona 
libraries or are available through 
special vendors. To this end, a listing 
of bookstores, vendors and publishers 
specializing in Southwest materials is 
included in this work. 

Print titles were obtained by searching 
bibliographies, as well as the holdings 
of Arizona libraries and bookstores. 
Publishers catalogs specializing in 
Southwest materials provided 
additional titles. All print materials 
listed in this bibliography were 
reviewed by compilers. Audio-visual 
materials were compiled from the 
holdings of the Department of Library, 
Archives and Public Records and 
public and school libraries in the state. 
Audio-visual materials were not 
previewed for inclusion, but all 
material is owned by a library or 
school in Arizona. Some materials 
included are not of the highest quality 
but have been included as the only 
sources of information of a topic. 

Materials are arranged alphabetically 
by author within each heading and are 
numbered serially throughout the 
text. This number, rather than a page 
number, will identify the book in the 
author, title, illustrator and subject 
indexes. Annotations are descriptive 
and in many cases are composed of 
table of contents entrees, restatements 
of Library of Congress summaries or 
catalog information.

Our directory of storytellers, authors 
and illustrators was compiled by 
surveying storytellers, authors and 
illustrators living in Arizona. 
Inclusion in our list indicated a 
willingness on the part of the artist to 
be included as well as residency in 
Arizona. Omission of a prominent 
name is most likely the result of a 
decision not to return a survey. As 
with all authors or illustrators, 
publishers can be contacted for 
information on the availability of a 
particular artist. 

Although every attempt has been 
made to include most print titles 
published since 1977 and current 
non-print materials, we have 
undoubtedly missed some resources. 
Their omission is due to our lack of 
awareness, their non-existence at the 
time of compilation or our inability to 
obtain them. Nc materials were 
added after September of 1991. 
Hopefully, future updates of this 
bibliography will correct any 
omissions. 

It is our sincere hope that readers will 
enjoy the Arizona presented to them in 
the many resources listed in 
ARIZONA HERITAGE. It is also 
hoped that with this enjoyment will 
come understanding and appreciation 
of the history and people of our state. 



Level of Materials listed 

We have indicated a tentative grade 
level for each resource suing the 
following code and classification: 

P Primary, kindergarten through 
grade three 

I Intermediate, grades four 
through six 

J Junior high, grades seven 
and eight 

An indication of a two-level span 
usually indicaios that the resource is 
both transitional in readir^/viewing 
level and interest. The individual's 
ability, interest, taste and purpose in 
using the material are the most 
important factors in assessing success 
with any particular resource. Adults 
are encouraged to be cautious in 
restricting any title based solely on 
assigned level. In the J level, many 
materials considered adult are 
included because the text and format 
are accessible to the junior high 
student.

INTRODUCTION 



Arizona is a fascinating place. It is an 
arid place, by and large, laid out under 
a huge bowl of a sky. It is filled with 
wonders whose like can't be found 
elsewhere in these United States. Our 
natural environment includes painted 
deserts, petrified forests, and the 
tree-tall, many-branched saguaro 
cactus. It includes a river that has cut 
the gigantic Grand Canyon, and other 
rivers that exist only as long, low, 
sandy tracks over which water will 
flow when there's enough rain in the 
nearbv mountains. It's a land of 
snakes, lizards, scorpions, and Gila 
monsters, of hawks and humming- 
birds, of desert fish and bighorned 
sheep, and once upon a time, 
mammoths. In all these things it 
stands apart from most of the other 
forty-eight continental states. 

Some of Arizona's families lived here 
before Columbus started on his world- 
changing vovage. Others have 
ancestors who helped found a cavalry 
post at Tucson m the days when 
Tucson was a part of the' Spanish 
Empire. Still other Arizona families 
arrived in search of new homes after 
the 1853 Gadsden Purchase, or with 
the coming of the railroads, or between 
the two World Wars, or the dav before 
yesterday. Each of these families 
carries its own cultural heritage, its 
own ways of looking at the world, and 
doing tHings. By that presence in our 
state, each enriches our shared 
heritage and adds possibilities to our 
future. 

So far I have been writing about 
Arizona as though it were a unified 
place. It isn't, really. The south- 
western deserts are as'different as can 
be from the mountains that run in a 



Great belt from northwest to southeast. 
The river valleys are totally unlike the 
high, dry plateau of the North. 
Phoenix is not Tucson, and both are 
completely different from Gu Achi, 
Moenkopi, Randolph, Clifton- 
Morenci, Thatcher, or Yuma, which in 
turn have little in common with each 
other. 

It strikes me that education, as a 
preparation for adult life, can logicallv 
start at the center and work outward. 
Children begin bv knowing who their 
mother and father are, and by 
identifying familiar surroundings. It 
is from the security of this knowledge 
that they are able "to take on the great 
world beyond. This should seem a 
good enough way to go at the 
problems or teaching a youngster 
about our nation and our world. And 
yet . . . 

About twentv years ago, I had 
occasion to visit a first grade class in 
one of Tucson's neighborhood 
elementary schools. The children 
were learning about the seasons. Fall, 
they were told, was the time when the 
leaves turned red and yellow and fell 
from the trees, while' winter was a 
season of snow. And so they went, 
through the course of the seasons as 
they exist elsewhere . I went away 
wondering how many of those kids 
would grow up thinking that 
something was lacking in the Arizona 
Desert â that it somehow wasn't quite 
as "real" as other parts of the country. 

Yet we have our seasons, too, and can 
watch and take joy in their coming and 
going. What better way to start 
learning about the world* of nature 
than through observation of what is 
going on day by day outdoors? We 
have our own history as well. 



ERLC 



Certainly it is connected with the 
world beyond us, and children must 
learn the story of that greater world, 
for they will become citizens not just of 
Arizona, but of the United States, and 
ultimately, of Spaceship Earth. But 
let's keep a thread of local and regional 
reality going all through the 
educational experience. It could be 
argued that a person in Arizona is 
blessed with a good deal more history 
than a New Englander. We have 
Concord and Lexington, of course, and 
the searing experience of the Civil War 
as part of our common heritage as 
citizens of the United States. But as 
Arizonans, we also have the saga of the 
Anasazi and Hohokam peoples and 
their attempts to farm a desert, the 
stories of the tribes that followed them 
and still live here, the tales of the 
Spaniards who came to be part of this 
land as well. 

All this is part of our specified heritage 
as Arizonans. Much of it is in the 
books listed here. Some are un- 
familiar to me, others are old and 
valued friends. My first introduction 



to Navajo culture was through having 
Laura Armour's Waterlpss Mountain 
read to me as a child. Years later, when 
I shared a workplace with a Navajo, 
there was much I had to learn, but a 
foundation for that learning had been 
laid. Thanks to that early reading 
experience, I felt myself among friends. 

Here is a list of introductions to friends 
of our state's children: rivers, 
mountains, cactus, animals, men, 
women, and children of our past and 

E resent. Each introduction â each 
ook â carries a special piece of 
information about our precious and 
fragile home. Our kids need to know 
all they can about that home â after all, 
it will someday be theirs to make or 
mar.
