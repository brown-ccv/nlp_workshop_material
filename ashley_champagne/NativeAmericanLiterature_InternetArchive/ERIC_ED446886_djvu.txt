ABSTRACT 



In keeping with its priority to reduce the disproportionate 
burden of heart, lung, and blood diseases in minority populations, the 
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute has established an outreach project 
called Building Healthy Hearts for American Indians and Alaska Natives. This 
background report provides an overview of the cardiovascular health status of 
this population to guide development of the project. Section 1 discusses the 
limitations of data on the health of Native people. The second section 
presents demographic characteristics of Native Americans. Section 3 discusses 
cardiovascular disease mortality, major cardiovascular risk factors, and 
effects of these risk factors on Native people. The fourth section describes 
health knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors of Native Americans including their 
perceptions of health. Section 5 highlights several existing community- based 
health promotion and disease prevention programs targeted at Native 
Americans. The sixth section presents recommended strategies for designing 
community-based health promotion programs for Native Americans based on the 
success of existing programs. Section 7 discusses five theoretical models of 
health promotion programs targeting Native people. The final section offers 
recommendations for improving the heart health of Native Americans based on 
existing literature, evaluations of current programs, and telephone 
interviews with people working to improve Native health. (Contains 60 
references.) (TD)

Foreword 



As we embark upon the new millennium of 
helping people improve their health through 
research, research training, and education 
activities, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood 
Institute (NHLBI) is committed to eliminating 
disparities in health status particularly among 
minority communities. Since 1972, The 
NHLBI has translated and disseminated 
knowledge to the community to promote pub- 
lic health and prevent and control heart, lung, 
and blood diseases and sleep disorders. 
Through its national education programs and 
Initiatives, the NHLBI seeks to increase public 
awareness and professional practice, set policy 
agendas, and generally improve the quality of 
life for all Americans. These programs include 
the National High Blood Pressure Education 
Program, the National Cholesterol Education 
Program, the National Heart Attack Alert 
Program, the National Asthma Education and 
Prevention Program, the NHLBI Obesity 
Education Initiative, and the National Center 
on Sleep Disorders Research. 

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading 
cause of death for all Americans, including 
American Indians and Alaska Natives 
(AI/AN). More AI/AN men and women over 
age 45 die from CVD than any other disease. 
CVD is the second leading medical cause of 
death after cirrhosis for Indian men and 
women ages 15-44. However, it is a relatively 
recent phenomenon among native populations. 
The prevalence of CVD has increased as more 
people adopt Western lifestyles characterized 



by high-fat, high-calorie diets and low levels 
of physical activity. Complicating efforts to 
combat risk factors is the lack of access many 
Native Americans have to clinical preventive 
services and health education. 

Through research and clinical studies we have 
determined that many of the risk factors that 
influence the prevalence and severity of CVD 
can be reduced by lifestyle changes. These risk 
factors include high blood pressure, high blood 
cholesterol, cigarette smoking, physical inac- 
tivity, obesity, and diabetes. Today, AI/AN 
struggle with the health burden of CVD and its 
associated risk factors. For example, diabetes 
has risen to epidemic proportions in some 
communities, and many other communities are 
fighting the battle against obesity and high 
blood pressure. 

Although significant improvements have been 
made in the Nation’s overall health, the gains 
are not equally shared by ethnic and racial 
minorities. By virtually every health status 
indicator— life expectancy, mortality, morbidity, 
use of and access to health resources— minori- 
ties fare poorly. These groups continue to suf- 
fer more acutely from disability and disease, 
and they share a disproportionate burden com- 
pared with the general population. The 
Institute’s priority is to determine better meth- 
ods to reduce the disproportionate burden of 
heart, lung, and blood disease and sleep disor- 
ders in minority populations.

This challenging quandary has led the NHLBI 
to establish an outreach project called Building 
Healthy Hearts for American Indian and 
Alaska Natives. This project seeks to promote 
healthy lifestyles and reduce the prevalence of 
CVD and its associated risk factors by devel- 
oping and implementing CVD prevention and 
control strategies designed specifically for 
AI/AN. 

The Institute thanks all those who have con- 
tributed to this background report which pro- 
vides an overview of the cardiovascular health 
status of AI/AN. This report will serve as a 
blueprint in the development of the project. 

The success depends on the involvement of all 
communities-this support has been given 
enthusiastically. Together, we will continue to 
strengthen the heart beat of this generation and 
generations to come.

Introduction 



The American Indian and Alaska Native popu- 
lation is the smallest self-identified, racial-eth- 
nic group in the United States, numbering 
about 2 million people. They are widely dis- 
persed across the Nation, belonging to more 
than 547 tribes and speaking more than 200 
distinct languages. As a population, American 
Indians and Alaska Natives generally are 
younger, have less education, and tend to be 
poorer than other populations in the United 
States. Many are employed in agriculture, 
craft, and repair service occupations; few work 
in managerial and professional specialty occu- 
pations. In this report, “native” and “native 
people” are used to refer to both American 
Indians and Alaska Natives. 

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading 
cause of death for all Americans, including 
American Indians and Alaska Natives. More 
men and women over 45 years old die from 
CVD than any other disease. CVD is a rela- 
tively recent phenomenon in the American 
Indian and Alaska Native population. As more 
native people adopt Western lifestyles charac- 
terized by a high-fat, high-calorie diet and low 
levels of physical activity, the prevalence of 
CVD increased in many native communities. 

Today, American Indians and Alaska Natives 
struggle with the health burden of CVD and its 
associated risk factors. Diabetes has risen to 
epidemic proportions in some populations, and 
many others are fighting the battle against 
obesity and high blood pressure. Because 




native people generally earn less than the aver- 
age American and tend to live in remote, rural 
locations, some may have limited access to 
clinical preventive services, health education, 
and prevention efforts. All these factors act 
synergistically to place native people at very 
high risk for chronic diseases. 

In 1990-92, CVD accounted for proportionally 
more deaths among American Indian and 
Alaska Natives age 45 to 64 than among peo- 
ple of the same age group in the general popu- 
lation. As this population ages, the absolute 
number of elderly and chronically ill people in 
this group is likely to increase. 

Because of the diversity of this population, 
health promotion efforts to improve the health 
status of American Indians and Alaska Natives 
should be tailored to the needs of specific tar- 
get communities. Native people are character- 
ized not by their homogeneity, but rather by 
their heterogeneity. Tribes differ markedly in 
their health and disease patterns and behaviors 
as well as in the sociocultural aspects of their 
lives. For example, whereas heart disease 
accounted for 15.9 percent of all deaths in 
1990-92 in the Tucson area, it accounted for 
32.4 percent of total deaths in Oklahoma 
(Indian Health Service, 1996). 

Although manifestations of health and disease 
patterns and societal norms vary, American 
Indians and Alaska Natives share a number of 
cultural values that can be effectively incorpo- 
rated into health promotion activities.

Organizing community-based programs at the 
local level and involving community members 
in all phases of program design, implementa- 
tion, and evaluation will ensure that programs 
are culturally sensitive, relevant, and appropri- 
ate. 

This report attempts to provide a comprehen- 
sive picture of CVD in the American Indian 
and Alaska Native population. It is organized 
into eight sections. 

♦ Limitations of the Data. This section dis- 
cusses the limitations of the data available 
on the health status of Native people. 

♦ Sociodemographics of American Indians 
and Alaska Natives. This section presents 
the demographic characteristics of native 
people in the United States. These attributes 
include population density, composition and 
geographic distribution, age, education, 
income and employment, and access to 
health care. 

♦ Cardiovascular Disease Among American 
Indians and Alaska Natives. This section 
discusses CVD mortality and provides infor- 
mation on each of the major cardiovascular 
risk factors — high blood cholesterol, high 
blood pressure, cigarette smoking, physical 
inactivity, diabetes mellitus, obesity. This 
section also discusses the dietary and alco- 
hol consumption practices and the effects of 
these risk factors on native people. 

♦ Native Culture and Perceptions of 
Health. This section describes the knowl- 
edge, beliefs, and behaviors of American 
Indians and Alaska Natives as well as their 
perceptions of health. Specific topics 
include social structure, concept of time, 
harmony with the environment, oral com- 
munication, and traditional and contempo- 
rary methods of healing. 



♦ Community-Based Health Promotion and 
Disease Prevention Programs for 
American Indians and Alaska Natives. 

This section highlights several existing pre- 
vention and intervention programs targeted 
to native communities. 

♦ Recommended Strategies for Effective 
Programs. This section presents recom- 
mended strategies for designing community- 
based health promotion programs for Amer- 
ican Indians and Alaska Natives, based on 
the success of existing programs. Discuss- 
ions with program planners and other influ- 
ential people who work directly with this 
population offer insight into various strate- 
gies. 

♦ Theoretical Models. This section discusses 
five theoretical models that can be incorpo- 
rated into the development of health promo- 
tion programs targeting native people. 

♦ Needs and Opportunities. This section 
offers recommendations for transforming 
needs in health promotion and disease pre- 
vention and control programs into opportu- 
nities to improve the heart health of Amer- 
ican Indians and Alaska Natives. The rec- 
ommendations are based on the existing epi- 
demiological literature, evaluations of cur- 
rent health promotion and disease preven- 
tion programs, and telephone interviews 
with people working to improve native 
health. The recommendations provide a 
framework on which to build effective health 
programs that increase the awareness of car- 
diovascular risk factors and their impact on 
heart health in native communities.

Limitations of the Data 



A paucity of data exists on the health status of 
American Indians and Alaska Natives. The 
lack of adequate representation of this popula- 
tion in national surveys and databases leaves 
researchers and program planners to rely 
almost exclusively on studies that focus on 
specific regions and tribes. The heterogeneity 
that characterizes native tribes, however, limits 
generalizations to all native peoples based on 
data on a particular tribe. Researchers must be 
aware of these and other limitations to the 
data. This section briefly highlights the bound- 
aries that exist in making conclusions based on 
the data on native people. 

U.S. Census Data 

Historically, American Indians and Alaska 
Natives have not been well represented in 
national surveys. Only recently has the U.S. 
Bureau of the Census included American 
Indians living in the Indian Territory and on 
reservations in population counts. In an 
attempt to include all native people in the cen- 
sus, the Census Bureau established liaisons 
with more than 300 tribal governments. 
Unfortunately, many households on American 
Indian reservations and in Alaska Native vil- 
lages were still excluded. In addition, many 
native people did not participate in the census 
due to their migration patterns between rural 
and urban areas or in protest to the U.S. 
Government’s treatment of indigenous peoples. 



The 1980 census estimated that racial minori- 
ties were undercounted by approximately 6 
percent. The estimated undercount of minori- 
ties in the 1990 census was at least as high 
(National Cancer Institute, 1993). 

National Health Surveys 

In the health arena, the types of data available 
for U.S. whites and African Americans are 
unavailable for American Indians and Alaska 
Natives. Native people have not been over- 
sampled in most health and nutrition surveys, 
particularly the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Surveys (NHANES). The few 
existing studies on the health of American 
Indians and Alaska Natives generally have 
been conducted in specific geographic regions 
and among different tribes. Given the wide 
variation in biological, sociodemographic, and 
sociocultural characteristics among this popu- 
lation, as well as the lack of sufficient total 
numbers to provide generalizable and accurate 
aggregate data, caution must be taken not to 
generalize specific data to all native people in 
the United States. 

Mortality Data and Surveys 

Other factors limiting the accuracy of available 
data on native people include racial misclassi- 
fication, blood quantum (percentage of 
American Indian or Alaska Native heritage), 
and tribal enrollment. For mortality data, 

States submit death certificates to the National 
Center for Health Statistics for inclusion in 




12 



3 



national mortality analyses. Unfortunately, 
people completing an individual’s death infor- 
mation may assume the decedent’s race by 
visual observation and without verification. 
This racial misclassification can lead to misin- 
formation in the State and national databases, 
resulting in potentially erroneous conclusions. 

Hahn and colleagues examined racial classifi- 
cation from birth and death certificates from 
1983 to 1985 for American Indian and Alaska 
Native infants in 33 reservation states. They 
concluded that misclassification of race on 
birth and death certificates tended to occur 
about 50 percent of the time (National Cancer 
Institute, 1993). Race and ethnicity questions 
on surveys also pose a classification problem. 
The number of people identifying themselves 
as American Indian or Alaska Native depends 
on whether the survey allows identification 
through ancestry, blood quantum, or tribal 
enrollment. 

Indian Health Service 

The Indian Health Service (1HS) databases 
reflect only a segment of the entire American 
Indian and Alaska Native population. The 1HS 
provides health services to all American Indian 
and Alaska Native persons residing in 1HS ser- 
vice areas. Only native people who have used 
IHS services within the last 3 years are includ- 
ed in the “user population” that is calculated 
by the IHS. Health information on people who 
have never used IHS facilities and people who 
use private practitioners and Veterans Admin- 
istration facilities is not included in the IHS 
database. 

In addition, data on native people who live in 
urban areas and obtain their health care from 
sources within the city are not usually provid- 
ed to the IHS for inclusion in its database 
(National Cancer Institute, 1993). Data report- 
ing may be further hampered in the future as 



American Indian tribes begin to assume more 
responsibility for their own health service 
delivery and health services for American 
Indians and Alaska Natives as a whole popula- 
tion become less cohesive. 

Differences in Data Collection 

Inconsistencies in data collection protocols 
among existing studies limit the ability to 
compare data accurately. Many studies do not 
follow a standard definition of risk factors. For 
example, obesity has been variably defined, 
and low- and high-density lipoprotein choles- 
terol values may or may not be included in the 
analysis or definition of hypercholesterolemia. 
In addition, measurement of risk factors differs 
substantially among studies. 

In testing for diabetes, some studies do not 
distinguish between insulin-dependent diabetes 
mellitus and non-insulin-dependent diabetes 
mellitus and they do not use glucose tolerance 
testing to screen for undiagnosed diabetes 
cases. Risk factors like physical inactivity, and 
cigarette smoking are also difficult to quantify 
or standardize. Furthermore, studies differ in 
their age standardization methods, making 
valid comparisons difficult (Ellis and Campos- 
Outcalt, 1994). Standardization of methodolo- 
gy and analysis of risk factors in future studies 
would facilitate comparison between groups.

Sociodemographics of American Indians 
and Alaska Natives 



Definition of American Indian 
and Alaska Native 

The Bureau of the Census uses self-identifica- 
tion to classify persons as American Indians or 
Alaska Natives and to identify tribal member- 
ship. The Census Bureau’s definition of 
American Indian or Alaska Native is “a person 
having origins in any of the original peoples of 
North America and who maintains cultural 
identification through tribal affiliations or 
community recognition.” Blood quantum, 
which indicates the percentage of American 
Indian or Alaska Native heritage, is not always 
a clear indication of American Indian or 
Alaska Native status. Persons who have one- 
sixteenth of native blood may mark American 
Indian or Alaska Native on the census 
although they may live a mainstream lifestyle. 
It should be noted, however, that persons iden- 
tifying themselves as American Indian or 
Alaska Native may not necessarily have one- 
sixteenth blood quantum. 

Population Density 

American Indians and Alaska Natives total 
about 2 million people in the United States. 
This population comprises the smallest self- 
identified racial group in the United States, 
less than 1 percent of the U.S. population. 
Between 1980 and 1990, the number of people 
who identified themselves as American 
Indians or Alaska Natives increased by 38 per- 
cent. The increase during this period was due 
not only to natural causes, but also to changes 



O

in people’s self-identification from other races 
to American Indian or Alaska Native. In addi- 
tion, improvements were made in methodolo- 
gy for counting people who live on reserva- 
tions, on trust lands, and in Alaska Native vil- 
lages (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1993). 
Projections estimate that the American Indian 
population will reach 4.6 million by the year 
2050. 

The Bureau of Indian Affairs currently recog- 
nizes more than 547 tribes of native people in 
the United States (Indian Health Service, 
1995a). Members of these tribes speak more 
than 200 distinct languages and are widely dis- 
persed across the United States.

Composition and Geographic 
Distribution 

In the 1 990 census, American Indians com- 
prised about 96 percent of the entire native 
population. About 19 percent identified them- 
selves as Cherokee, 12 percent as Navajo, 6 
percent each as Chippewa and Sioux, and 5 
percent as Choctaw. The next five largest 
tribes were Pueblo, Apache, Iroquois, Lumbee, 
and Creek. Most tribes had fewer than 10,000 
members in 1990. 

Native people were the first inhabitants of 
North America. Most credible scholars believe 
that approximately 25,000 years ago, 

American Indians and Alaska Natives crossed 
the Bering Strait from Siberia and settled the 
entire Western Hemisphere over a period of 
10,000 to 15,000 years. 

Migration was common, but contact with 
European explorers and settlers forced two 
major periods of mass migration. First, the 
transmission of infectious diseases from early 
European settlers devastated the American 
Indian population. Many surviving Indians 
resettled in smaller, more widely separated 
groups. Second, a series of legislative acts was 
passed, forcing American Indians to settle into 
locations specified by law. 

The Indian Removal Act of 1830 forced 
American Indians to move to territories west 
of the Mississippi River. By 1887, most 
American Indians were resettled on reserva- 
tions or in the Indian territory of Oklahoma. 
After World War II, Congress passed the 
Indian Relocation Act of 1956. American 
Indians once again migrated, this time to urban 
areas, where they were encouraged to enhance 
their economic opportunity and assimilate into 
mainstream society even more than before 
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 
1992). 



Today, nearly half of the American Indian pop- 
ulation resides in the West, 30 percent in the 
South, 1 8 percent in the Midwest, and 6 per- 
cent in the Northeast. More than half of the 
Native population are located in seven States: 
Alaska, Arizona, California, New Mexico, 
North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Washington; 
the largest proportion resides in Oklahoma. 

The Alaska Native population consists of 
Eskimos, American Indians, and Aleuts. Of the 
nearly 86,000 Alaska Natives living in Alaska, 
more than one-half of these are Eskimo, 
approximately one-third are American Indian, 
and slightly more than one-tenth are Aleut. 

The two main Eskimo groups living in Alaska 
are the Inupiat, who live in the north and 
northwest parts, and the Yupik, who live in the 
south and southwest parts. The primary 
American Indian tribes living in Alaska are 
Athabascan, Tlingit, Tsimshian, and Haida. 

There are 314 Federal reservations and trust 
lands, 217 Alaska Native village statistical 
areas, 12 Alaska Native regional corporations, 
and 17 tribal jurisdiction statistical areas in the 
United States. Contrary to the popular belief 
that most American Indians and Alaska 
Natives live on reservations or in small vil- 
lages, only about 22 percent of the American 
Indian and Alaska Native population live on 
reservations and historic trust lands and 15 
percent live in tribal or village statistical areas. 
The rest, 63 percent, live in urban centers 
around the country. For Alaska Natives, how- 
ever, only about one-third live in urban areas, 
primarily Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Juneau. 
The other two-thirds of the Alaska Native pop- 
ulation live in one of more than 200 rural vil- 
lages with populations of 50 to 1,000 people. 
Alaska Natives also live in the continental 
United States, especially the Northwestern 
States and California (National Cancer 
Institute, 1993).

Age 

In general, American Indians and Alaska 
Natives are a much younger population than 
other racial groups, due in part to their high 
fertility rates. The American Indian median 
age in 1990 was 26 years, which is 7 years 
younger than the median age of 33 years for 
the general population (U.S. Bureau of the 
Census, 1993). Thirty-four percent of Native 
people are younger than age 18, compared to 
approximately 25 percent of the U.S. general 
population. In addition, only 6 percent of this 
population were older than age 65, compared 
to 13 percent of all races in the United States 
(U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1990). Figure 1 
displays the age distribution of American 
Indians and Alaska Natives. 



Education 

Overall, American Indians have less education 
than the general population. According to 1990 
census data, 66 percent of American Indians 
over age 25 have completed high school and 
about 9 percent possess a bachelor’s degree or 
higher. In comparison, in the general popula- 
tion, 75 percent of persons over age 25 have 
completed high school and 20 percent have a 
bachelor’s degree or higher, as shown in figure 
2. Approximately 85 percent of American 
Indian youth attend public schools, 10 percent 
attend Bureau of Indian Affair (BIA) schools, 
and 5 percent attend private schools. 

In addition, Alaska Natives are less likely to 
have graduated from high school or college 
than the general population in Alaska. Sixty-

three percent of Alaska Natives over age 25 
completed high school or higher compared 
with 87 percent of the entire State population. 
In addition, only 4 percent of Alaska Natives 
had a college degree or higher compared with 
23 percent of the statewide population. 

Income and Employment 

American Indians and Alaska Natives tend to 
be poorer than other populations in the United 
States. In 1989, 31 percent of native people 
lived at or below the poverty level. This is 
more than twice the number of poor people in 
the total U.S. population (13 percent) and 
almost three times the number of whites living 
at or below the poverty level (12 percent). 
Twenty-one percent of Alaska Native families 
live below the poverty line, compared to 7 per- 
cent of all families in Alaska. 



The median family income in 1990 for 
American Indians was $21,750, whereas the 
median family income for the total U.S. popu- 
lation was $35,225. Alaska Natives also 
earned less than other people in Alaska (figure 
3). Although Alaska has the highest median 
family income ($46,581 a year) in the United 
States, the median family income among 
Alaska Natives was only $26,695, which is 
only 57 percent of the median income for the 
State. In Alaska, Aleut families earned an 
average of $36,472 followed by American 
Indians at $29,339, and Eskimos at $23,257. 

American Indians residing on reservations and 
trust lands are the poorest segment of the 
American Indian and Alaska Native popula- 
tion. In 1989, 51 percent were living below the 
poverty level. The per capita income in 1989 
ranged from slightly more than $3,000 per per- 



BEST COPY AVAILABLE

17 



son to nearly $5,000 per person. One-fifth, or 
20 percent, of the housing units on reserva- 
tions and trust lands lacked complete plumbing 
facilities, compared with 6 percent of all 
American Indian households in the United 
States. 

Overall, 62 percent of American Indians age 
16 and older were in the labor force in 1990. 
The majority of American Indians were 
employed in agriculture, craft, and repair ser- 
vice occupations — namely, operators, fabrica- 
tors, and laborers. A smaller proportion of 
American Indians and Alaska Natives than of 
the total population worked in managerial and 
professional specialty occupations. 

Access to Health Care 

The Indian Health Service is an agency within 
the U.S. Department of Health and Human 



Services. The IHS is responsible for providing 
comprehensive health services to members of 
federally recognized American Indian and 
Alaska Native tribes. An individual is eligible 
for services if he or she is “regarded as Indian 
by the community in which he [or she] lives as 
evidenced by such factors as tribal member- 
ship, enrollment, residence on tax-exempt 
land, ownership of restricted property, active 
participation in tribal affairs, or other relevant 
factors in keeping with general Bureau of 
Indian Affairs practices in the jurisdiction.” 
The 1990 census identified more than 2 mil- 
lion people of Indian heritage; approximately 
1.41 million of this group are eligible for IHS 
services (Indian Health Service, 1996). Most 
American Indians and Alaska Natives who do 
not receive IHS health services reside in urban 
areas.

The goal of the IHS is to raise the health status 
of American Indians and Alaska Natives by 
providing them preventive, curative, rehabili- 
tative and environmental health services. 

Tribes are offered opportunities for maximum 
involvement in developing and managing pro- 
grams to meet health needs. Health services 
are delivered directly through IHS facilities, 
through IHS contractual arrangements with 
providers in the private sector, and through 
tribally operated programs and urban Indian 
health programs. 

The IHS health services delivery system is 
managed through 12 regional units called area 
offices, which cover all or parts of 33 States 
known as Reservation States. These area 
offices provide administrative support to 72 
local service units, which are the basic health 
organizations for a geographic area served by 
the IHS. As of October 1994, these 72 IHS- 
operated service units administered 40 hospi- 
tals and 1 1 9 health centers, school health cen- 
ters, and health stations. 

Some of the health programs are operated by 
tribes, and a limited number of projects serve 
American Indians living in urban areas. In 
1994, 71 tribally operated service units admin- 
istered 9 hospitals and 342 health centers, 
health stations, and Alaska village clinics. 
Thirty-four Indian-operated urban projects 
ranged from information referral and commu- 
nity health services to comprehensive primary 
health care services. 

American Indians and Alaska Natives obtain 
their health care through a variety of sources, 
not just through the IHS, tribally operated ser- 
vice units, and urban projects. Many have 
employer-sponsored medical benefits and use 
private practitioners and third-party payment. 
Native people not living in the 33 reservation 
States must either use alternative health care 
resources or travel great distances to obtain 



IHS services. In addition, the transitory 
lifestyle of many American Indians who 
migrate between reservations and cities in 
search of employment may contribute to the 
lack of health care access for this migrant pop- 
ulation.

Cardiovascular Disease Among 
American Indians and Alaska Natives 



Cardiovascular Disease Mortality 

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of 
death in the United States regardless of gender, 
race, or ethnicity. For CVD deaths in the total 
population, the 1 992 age-adjusted death rate 
was 180.4 deaths per 100,000 population. The 
age-adjusted death rates for the two major 
components of CVD — coronary heart disease 
and stroke — -were 144.3 and 26.2 respectively. 
Only recently has CVD been prevalent among 
American Indians and Alaska Natives. 



Although overall mortality rates for native 
people are lower than those of the general pop- 
ulation, CVD is now the leading cause of 
death for this population. The CVD death rate 
for native people is 132.8 deaths per 100,000 
population. The mortality rate for coronary 
heart disease (CHD) in native people is 107.1 
cases per 100,000 population. The mortality 
rate for stroke, the fifth leading cause of death 
for this population, is 19.1 cases per 100,000 
population (Plepys and Klein, 1995) (figure 4). 
Mortality rates for both CHD and cerebrovas-

cular disease is higher for native people resid- 
ing in the IHS service area: in 1990-92, the 
CHD mortality rate was 1 14.2 cases per 
100,000 population and the stroke mortality 
rate was 23.0 cases per 100,000 population 
(Indian Health Service, 1996). 

Risk Factors 

Population-based studies have led to the iden- 
tification of risk factors for cardiovascular dis- 
ease. Although some risk factors such as age, 
gender, and family history cannot be con- 
trolled, others can be prevented and managed 
by altering one’s lifestyle, thus reducing the 
risk of cardiovascular disease. Modifiable risk 
factors include high blood cholesterol, high 
blood pressure, smoking, physical inactivity, 
diabetes, obesity, and heavy alcohol consump- 
tion. The following section discusses the most 
common modifiable risk factors for cardiovas- 
cular disease and their effects on American 
Indians and Alaska Natives. 

High Blood Cholesterol 

Cholesterol is a waxy substance that the body 
manufactures to make hormones, vitamin D, 
and bile acids. The body produces enough 
cholesterol to fill its needs, but cholesterol also 
is taken into the body through the diet. Over 
time, extra cholesterol and fat circulating in the 
blood can accumulate on the inner walls of the 
arteries that supply blood to the heart. These 
deposits narrow the arteries, slowing or even 
blocking the flow of blood to the heart and 
increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease. 

The National Cholesterol Education Program 
has defined ranges for blood cholesterol levels 
as desirable, borderline-high, and high blood 
cholesterol. For adults, a blood cholesterol 
level lower than 200 mg/dL is desirable. A 
cholesterol level between 200 and 239 mg/dL 
is considered borderline-high, and high blood 
cholesterol is defined as 240 mg/dL or greater 



(National Cholesterol Education Program, 
1993). 

Two specific kinds of blood cholesterol are 
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and 
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. 
LDL cholesterol, sometimes called “bad” cho- 
lesterol, causes cholesterol to accumulate in 
the walls of the arteries. The more LDL that 
exists in the blood, the greater the risk for 
heart disease. Conversely, HDL cholesterol has 
been dubbed “good cholesterol” because it 
helps the body remove the cholesterol from the 
blood. Unlike total and LDL cholesterol, more 
HDL cholesterol in the blood reduces the risk 
for heart disease. 

Although the mean total cholesterol levels of 
American Indians and Alaska Natives are gen- 
erally lower or comparable to the levels of 
other U.S. populations, variation occurs 
between regions. Data from the Strong Heart 
Study, a study of 12 tribes in Arizona, North 
Dakota, Oklahoma, and South Dakota indicat- 
ed that 30 to 40 percent of all American 
Indians had cholesterol levels greater than 200 
mg/dL. Twenty five percent of the Arizona 
Pima Indians had blood cholesterol levels at or 
above 200 mg/dL compared with 47 percent of 
the North Dakota and South Dakota partici- 
pants. Furthermore, the high blood cholesterol 
rates for American Indians were lower than 
those of the U.S. general population. The 
prevalence of high blood cholesterol (> 240 
mg/dL) among men of all races in the United 
States is 28 percent and 34 percent for women. 
In the Strong Heart Study the prevalence of 
high blood cholesterol was 8.6 percent for 
males and 12.7 percent for females (Welty et 
al., 1995) (figure 5). 

Thirty-four percent of Navajo men age 25 to 
74 had elevated total cholesterol levels com- 
pared to 28 percent of men of the same age 
group studied in the 1976-80 National Health

and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 
II). Younger Navajo women had total choles- 
terol concentrations similar to those for 
women younger than age 55 from the 
NHANES II, but the cholesterol levels were 
significantly lower among older Navajo 
women. Interestingly, the prevalence of total 
cholesterol concentrations greater than 240 
mg/dL was 17.5 percent in Navajo women, 
which was about half the prevalence rate of 
women studied in the NHANES II (32.9 per- 
cent) (Sugarman et al., 1992). 

High Blood Pressure 

Blood pressure is the force of the blood push- 
ing against the walls of the arteries. Several 
factors affect blood pressure, including the 
amount of blood flowing through the arteries, 
the rate of blood flow, and the resiliency of the 
arterial walls. High blood pressure, also called 
hypertension, occurs when there is resistance 



to blood flow through the arteries and the heart 
exerts extra pressure to carry blood to vital 
organs and muscles. High blood pressure not 
only increases the risk of heart attack and 
stroke, but it is also closely linked to conges- 
tive heart failure, chronic occlusive peripheral 
vascular disease, aortic aneurysm, and renal 
failure. It is often called the “silent killer” 
because many people are not aware of their 
symptoms until damage has already been done 
to the heart, brain, or kidney. 

Blood pressure is reported in two numbers. 

The first number, systolic blood pressure, 
denotes the point of greatest pressure, when 
the heart contracts and pumps blood through 
the arteries. The second number, diastolic 
blood pressure, represents the point of lowest 
pressure when the heart relaxes between beats. 
A reading of 120/80 mm Hg is considered 
optimal blood pressure (National High Blood

13 



Pressure Education Program, 1993b). Persons 
are considered to have hypertension if their 
systolic blood pressure measures 140 mm Hg 
or higher, their diastolic blood pressure mea- 
sures 90 mm Hg or higher at two or more vis- 
its over one to several weeks, or they are cur- 
rently taking medication for high blood pres- 
sure (National High Blood Pressure Education 
Program, 1993a). 

The risk of cardiovascular morbidity, disabili- 
ty, and mortality increases progressively with 
incremental increases in blood pressure. Even 
persons with high-normal blood pressure (sys- 
tolic blood pressure of 130 to 139 mm Hg or 
diastolic blood pressure of 85 to 89 mm Hg) 
are considered at increased risk for disease 
(National High Blood Pressure Education 
Program, 1993a). However, data show that 
even a slight decrease in blood pressure levels 
can substantially reduce cardiovascular risk. 



For example, a downward shift of only 2 mm 
Hg in the average national systolic blood pres- 
sure might reduce the annual mortality from 
stroke, heart disease, and all causes by 6, 4, 
and 3 percent, respectively (National High 
Blood Pressure Education Program, 1993b). 

The incidence of high blood pressure is 
increasing in native populations. Hypertension 
accounts for 42 percent of all IHS ambulatory 
visits, exceeded only by upper respiratory 
infections, otitis media, and diabetes (National 
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 1 996b). An 
important aspect of high blood pressure among 
American Indians and Alaska Natives is its 
strong association with diabetes and the appar- 
ent synergistic increase in morbidity when the 
two occur together (National Heart, Lung, and 
Blood Institute, 1996b). Figure 6 shows the 
prevalence rates of high blood pressure 
(> 140/90 mmHg or taking antihypertensive

medication) among male and female Strong 
Heart participants. 

The prevalence of hypertension varies by the 
region and by tribe. Studies show that Yaqui 
Indians of Arizona, the urban Chippewa of 
Minnesota, and the Cree and Ojibwa tribes all 
had higher systolic blood pressure than whites, 
and all but the Chippewa had higher diastolic 
blood pressure than their white counterparts 
(Ellis and Campos-Outcalt, 1994). Data from 
the Strong Heart Study revealed that American 
Indians age 45 to 74 living in Oklahoma and 
Arizona had higher rates of hypertension (42 
to 47 percent) than the country as a whole (38 
to 43 percent) for similar age groups in 1988- 
91 (Welty et al., 1995). 

Pima Indians appear to have a higher preva- 
lence of high blood pressure than other 
American Indian and Alaska Native tribes. 

One study indicates that, in 1992, more than 
40 percent of male and more than 30 percent 
of female Pima Indians had hypertension, 
compared to less than 20 percent of male and 
approximately 15 percent of female American 
Indians and Alaska Natives served by the 
Indian Health Service (National Heart, Lung, 
and Blood Institute, 1996b). 

Some native people, however, have hyperten- 
sion prevalence rates lower than other U.S. 
populations. The mean systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure of Yupik Eskimos was lower 
than whites in the 1988-91 NHANES 
(NHANES III), except for Yupik females age 
30 to 40, who had diastolic blood pressure lev- 
els similar to African Americans in the 
NHANES III (National Heart, Lung, and 
Blood Institute, 1996b). Among Strong Heart 
Study participants living in North Dakota and 
South Dakota, only 27 percent of men and 28 
percent of women had hypertension in 1988- 
91, compared to 43 percent of men and 38 per- 
cent of women of all races in the United States 
(Welty et al., 1995). 



The level of hypertension awareness was high 
in Strong Heart Study participants with high 
blood pressure. About 75 percent of partici- 
pants were aware that they had hypertension, 
and more than 50 percent of the persons with 
hypertension were treating and controlling it. 
This level of awareness was comparable to 
those of white and African American partici- 
pants with hypertension in the NHANES III 
(Welty et al., 1995). 

Cigarette Smoking 

Cigarette smoking is an independent risk fac- 
tor for cardiovascular disease and acts syner- 
gistically with other risk factors such as high 
blood pressure and high blood cholesterol. The 
estimated number of preventable deaths in the 
United States from coronary heart disease 
alone related to smoking is more than 90,000 
deaths each year, and an additional 37,000 
deaths from CHD are attributed to passive 
smoking each year. Cigarette smoke is estimat- 
ed to be responsible for more than 20 percent 
of all CHD deaths in men age 65 and older 
and for approximately 45 percent of deaths in 
men younger than age 65 (McBride, 1992). 

The risk for CHD attributable to smoking in 
women is similar. In the Nurses’ Health Study, 
more than 50 percent of the risk for premature 
fatal and nonfatal CHD was attributable to 
smoking (McBride, 1992). 

Cigarette smoking contributes greatly to the 
development and progression of atherosclero- 
sis in coronary arteries, thrombosis, and acute 
and chronic CHD events. Exposure to smoke 
causes coronary blood vessels to constrict, 
which may promote endothelial injury and 
lead to plaque development or progression and 
local thrombosis. Smoking also increases the 
stickiness of blood platelets, promoting their 
adhesion to the lining of the arteries and 
increasing the likelihood of a clot forming in 
the narrowed arteries. The degree of risk of 
smoking is related to the number of cigarettes 



r 



smoked, and heavier smoking is associated 
with even higher risk of death and myocardial 
infarction (McBride, 1992). 

In smokers, a combination of factors sets the 
stage for a heart attack. Smoking increases 
oxygen demand by raising the heart rate, blood 
pressure, and peripheral arterial resistance. In 
addition, carbon monoxide in smoke binds to 
hemoglobin in red blood cells, thereby reduc- 
ing the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. 
This altered ability of coronary vessels to reg- 
ulate blood flow, coupled with a decreased 
oxygen-carrying capacity, can produce 
ischemia and possibly sudden death. One 
study examining the effects of smoking in 
CHD patients revealed 33 percent more 
episodes of ischemia per day and a significant- 
ly longer duration of ischemia in smoking 
patients. Cohort and population studies 
demonstrate that cigarette smoking substantial- 
ly increases the risk of sudden death 
(McBride, 1992). 

Cigarette smoking is also associated with 
changes in the lipoprotein distribution. 

Nicotine elevates very-low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol while reducing high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol. These combined 
effects may promote endothelial cell injury 
and reduce vascular repair mechanisms. 

Cigarette smoking cessation, however, is relat- 
ed to a marked decrease in CVD, including 
reduced cardiac arrest, coronary death, and 
myocardial infarction. Studies of both men and 
women consistently suggest a large reduction 
of cardiovascular risk following 1 year of 
smoking cessation and a gradual return over 5 
to 1 0 years to risks similar to those of people 
who never smoked. 

Passive smoking is also an important risk fac- 
tor for heart disease morbidity and mortality. 
Evidence from numerous studies links envi- 



ronmental tobacco smoke (ETS) to heart dis- 
ease mortality and accounts for 70 percent of 
all deaths due to ETS. Evidence also indicates 
that nonsmokers are more sensitive to smoke, 
including cardiovascular effects, and that pas- 
sive smoke contains a higher concentration of 
gas constituents, including carbon monoxide 
(McBride, 1992). 

Smoking has long been part of the culture of 
many American Indian tribes. Men smoke 
tobacco and the dried leaves, roots, and bark 
of other plants on ceremonial and social occa- 
sions. For tribes like the Chippewa, tobacco is 
considered a gift from the spirit and thus has 
“magic power.” It increases the efficacy of a 
request and makes an obligation or agreement 
more binding (Gillum et al., 1984). 

Today, many American Indians and Alaska 
Natives smoke and no longer solely for spiri- 
tual reasons. Studies have shown a higher 
prevalence of smoking among American 
Indians than whites; however, there are sub- 
stantial regional variations. The national smok- 
ing prevalence rates for 1987-91 among native 
people were 33 percent for men and 27 per- 
cent for women, compared to 26 percent for 
white men and 23 percent for white women. 

Data from the Strong Heart Study show that 
smoking rates in some regions may be even 
higher. In North Dakota and South Dakota, 53 
percent of men and 45 percent of women 
smoked (Welty et al., 1995). In a cross-sec- 
tional study of Pascua Yaqui Indian adults age 
25 to 65 in Arizona, 43 percent of men and 24 
percent of women reported smoking (Campos- 
Outcalt et al., 1995). Among Alaska Natives, 
47 percent of men and 39 percent of women 
smoke (Department of Health and Social 
Services, 1996). Overall, men tended to smoke 
more cigarettes than women in all age groups 
(Campos-Outcalt et al., 1995).

These high rates are not indicative of all 
American Indian and Alaska Native popula- 
tions, however. A study conducted on adult 
Pima Indians in Arizona indicated a very low 
prevalence of cigarette use; less than 1 percent 
smoked (Nelson et al., 1990). The Strong Heart 
Study also confirmed these low rates of smok- 
ing in the Southwest. The prevalence of smok- 
ing among American Indians in Arizona was 
30 percent of men and 13 percent of women. 

The use of cigars, pipes, and smokeless tobac- 
co appears to be uncommon among adults. 
Fewer than 5 percent of the Strong Heart 
Study participants smoked cigars or pipes, and 
smokeless tobacco use was rare (Welty et al., 

1 995). However, higher rates of smokeless 
tobacco use have been reported in American 
Indian children and adolescents, especially 
those living on reservations (National Cancer 
Institute, 1993). 

Although adult American Indian men smoke 
more than women, data from an Indian 
Adolescent Health Survey reveal the opposite. 
This survey, administered to 13,454 students in 
seventh through twelfth grade, revealed that 
for every grade level after the seventh grade, 
females were more likely to be daily cigarette 
smokers than males, rising from 9 percent in 
junior high school to 1 8 percent in high 
school. The percentage for males increased 
from 8 percent in junior high school to 1 5 per- 
cent in high school. However, daily use of 
smokeless tobacco was higher for males than 
females, with 1 7 percent of high school males 
using smokeless tobacco compared to 8 per- 
cent of females. 

Data from the 1 990 Great Alaska Spit-Out 
Tobacco Use Survey, completed by 1,555 
Alaskan schoolchildren, showed that the 
prevalence of both cigarette smoking and use 
of smokeless tobacco was 1 6 percent each 
(National Cancer Institute, 1993). A study by 



Beauvais (1992) showed that cigarette use was 
highest for American Indian youth living on 
reservations compared to nonreservation 
Indian youth and white youth. Up to 74 per- 
cent of eighth graders and 80 percent of 
twelfth graders living on reservations smoke 
cigarettes. Smoking prevention programs need 
to focus on native youth before they begin 
using tobacco. 

Physical Inactivity 

Evidence indicates that physical inactivity is 
an independent risk factor for heart disease. 
People who are physically inactive are almost 
twice as likely to develop heart disease than 
those who are more active (National Institutes 
of Health, 1995). Physical activity may protect 
against the development of CVD and may help 
control high blood cholesterol, high blood 
pressure, diabetes, and obesity. Several studies 
have shown that exercise training programs 
significantly reduce overall mortality as well 
as death caused by myocardial infarction. 

The NIH Consensus Statement on Physical 
Activity and Cardiovascular Health recom- 
mends a minimum of 30 minutes of moderate- 
intensity physical activity on most, and prefer- 
ably all, days of the week for all children and 
adults. In addition to formal exercise pro- 
grams, occupational, nonoccupational, and 
daily living tasks such as brisk walking, home 
repair, and yardwork have similar cardiovascu- 
lar and health benefits if performed at a level 
of moderate intensity with an accumulated 
duration of at least 30 minutes per day. The 
recommended daily duration may be broken 
up into shorter bouts of activity of at least 10 
minutes each. 

A sedentary lifestyle has replaced a traditional 
American Indian lifestyle of long ago, when 
hunting, fishing, and gathering was a way of 
life. Isolation, a high unemployment rate, 
extreme weather conditions, and a lack of 



recreational facilities all contribute to televi- 
sion being used as a means of entertainment 
and occupying idle time. American Indians in 
the Strong Heart Study reported watching tele- 
vision an average of 3 hours per day. A seden- 
tary lifestyle was common among the three 
groups, with Arizona Indians being the least 
active. In all centers, 38 percent of men and 48 
percent of women reported no activity during 
the past week and 17 percent of men and 20 
percent of women reported no activity during 
the past year (Welty et al., 1995). 

Diabetes Mellitus 

Diabetes mellitus is a group of disorders char- 
acterized by high blood glucose levels. Type I, 
or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 
(IDDM), is an autoimmune disease that is rare 
among American Indians and Alaska Natives. 

It occurs when the insulin-producing beta cells 
in the pancreas are destroyed. People with type 
I diabetes must have daily insulin injections to 
survive. Type II, or non-insulin-dependent dia- 
betes mellitus (NIDDM), occurs when body 
cells become resistant to insulin and do not 
metabolize glucose properly. Type II diabetes 
is more common among adults, especially 
those who have a family history of diabetes, 
are overweight, are older than age 40, and are 
of African American, Latino, or American 
Indian descent. Many people with type II dia- 
betes are able to control their blood sugar 
through weight control, regular exercise, and a 
healthful diet. Some may need insulin injec- 
tions or oral medications to lower their blood 
sugar (National Institute of Diabetes and 
Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 1992). 

Type II diabetes, once rarely diagnosed among 
American Indians, has reached epidemic pro- 
portions in many American Indian and Alaska 
Native communities. Although NIDDM has a 
genetic component, with rates highest in full- 
blooded American Indians, the incidence and 
prevalence of the disease has increased dra- 



matically as native people adopt Western 
lifestyles, with accompanying increases in 
body weight and diminished physical activity. 

A 1987 Special Medical Expenditure Survey 
of American Indians and Alaska Natives eligi- 
ble for IHS services showed that the age- and 
sex-adjusted diabetes rate in individuals older 
than age 19 was 12 percent, compared with 5 
percent in the general population. However, 
the prevalence of diabetes varies considerably 
between regions. Only 4 cases of diabetes per 
1 ,000 population were found among the Inuit 
of the Northwest Territories, whereas the Pima 
Indians of Arizona have a prevalence of 500 
cases per 1,000 population, the highest rate of 
NIDDM in the world (National Institute of 
Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 
1995b). 

Among Alaska Natives, the prevalence of dia- 
betes was 16 cases per 1,000, but prevalence 
varied by ethnic group: 27 cases per 1,000 
among Aleuts, 22 cases per 1,000 among 
Alaskan Indians, and 9 cases per 1,000 among 
Alaskan Eskimos (Schraer et al., 1988). 
Among participants of the Strong Heart Study, 
65 percent of Arizona Indian men and 71 per- 
cent of Arizona Indian women had diabetes. In 
Oklahoma, North Dakota, and South Dakota, 
33 percent of men and approximately 40 per- 
cent of women had diabetes. Diabetes 
appeared to be more prevalent among women 
than men (Welty et al., 1995). 

Diabetes and its complications are a major 
cause of morbidity and mortality in native 
populations. The age-adjusted diabetes death 
rate for American Indians in 1984-86 was 2.7 
times the rate for the general population. This 
reflects only cases in which diabetes was the 
primary cause of death, not those in which it 
was a contributing cause. The National 
Mortality Followback Study also found that 
American Indian and Alaska Native heritage 







18 



27 



was underreported on death certificates by 65 
percent. When the 1986-88 relative mortality 
rates were adjusted for underreporting of her- 
itage, the diabetes mortality for native people 
was 4.3 times the rate for whites (National 
Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney 
Diseases, 1995a). 

A New Mexico study demonstrated that 
American Indians experienced 3.6 times the 
diabetes death rates of whites, and a mortality 
study on Canadian Indian reservations in seven 
provinces found the risk of death from dia- 
betes to be 2.2 times higher for Canadian 
Indian men and 4.1 times higher for Canadian 
Indian women than the rates for the Canadian 
population as a whole (National Institute of 
Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 
1995a). Detailed mortality studies in Pimas 
during 1975-84 found that the age- and sex- 
adjusted death rate from diabetes was 1 1 .9 
times greater than the 1980 death rate for all 
races in the United States (National Institute of 
Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 
1995a). 

The health burden from NIDDM comes pri- 
marily from complications. Kidney disease, 
cardiovascular disease, stroke, eye disease, and 
amputations caused by nerve disease are some 
of the long-term complications that arise from 
NIDDM. Between 1983 and 1986, kidney dis- 
ease resulting in end- stage renal disease 
occurred in Indians at nearly six times the rate 
seen among U.S. whites. Researchers have 
found that Pima Indians have more than 20 
times the rates of new cases of kidney failure 
as the general U.S. population, and diabetes is 
responsible more than 90 percent of the time 
(National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive 
and Kidney Diseases, 1995a). 

Cardiovascular disease is two to four times 
more common in people with diabetes. In fact, 
cardiovascular disease is present in 75 percent 
of diabetes-related death. Diabetes is related to 



lipoprotein metabolism, atherosclerosis, obesi- 
ty, and hypertension. Diabetes is an indepen- 
dent risk factor for CHD, and the risk is dou- 
bled when high blood pressure is present 
(National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 
1994). 

Studies of specific tribes clearly suggest that 
diabetes is a major risk factor for cardiovascu- 
lar disease in all Native populations. Among 
Navajos, half of all diagnosed myocardial 
infarctions documented from 1976-79 to 1984- 
86 occurred in people with diabetes. In one 
study, nearly one-third of all participants with 
diabetes also had cardiovascular disease. Of 
those age 60 and older, who constitute nearly 
half of the population with diabetes, 33 per- 
cent of the women and nearly 60 percent of 
the men were afflicted. Age-adjusted rates for 
persons with diabetes were 5.2 times those of 
persons without diabetes for heart disease, 

10.2 times for cerebrovascular disease, and 6.8 
times for peripheral vascular disease (Hoy et 
al., 1995). In Pima Indians, a tribe with low 
coronary heart disease rates, all CHD deaths 
during 1975-84 occurred in persons with dia- 
betes. The study found that a longer duration 
of diabetes was associated with an increased 
incidence of fatal CHD in Pima Indians 
(Nelson et al., 1990). In Strong Heart Study 
participants, diabetes was the strongest risk 
factor for CVD, especially among women 
(Howard et al., 1995). 

Obesity 

The prevalence of overweight and obesity are 
usually measured using body mass index 
(BMI), which is a ratio relating body weight to 
height. Overweight is defined as a BMI of 25 
to 29.9 kg/m 2 . Obesity is defined as a BMI of 
30. Waist circumference is positively correlat- 
ed with abdominal fat content. Adults with a 
BMI of 25 to 34.9 kg/m 2 are considered to be 
at greater risk for obesity-related factors if 
their waist measurement is greater than 40 



O 

ERIC

19 



inches for men and 35 inches for women 
(National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 
1998). 

Obesity is associated with an increased risk for 
high blood pressure, diabetes, and high blood 
cholesterol. Even mild to moderate overweight 
is associated with a substantial elevation in 
coronary risk. However, weight loss can 
reduce cardiovascular risk. Data from the 
Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young 
Adults (CARDIA) study show that weight loss 
(initial loss of 5 pounds without regain of 
more than 5 pounds over 5 years) decreases 
blood pressure and raises HDL cholesterol lev- 
els (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 
1994). 

In the early 1 900s, obesity was rare among 
American Indians and Alaska Natives; how- 
ever, by the late 1 960s, high rates of obesity 
were reported in some tribes. In the 1987 
National Medical Expenditure Survey, 34 per- 
cent of American Indian males were over- 
weight compared to 24 percent of males in the 
general population. Similarly, 40 percent of 
American Indian females were overweight 
compared to 25 percent of females in the gen- 
eral population. The prevalence of obesity in 
American Indians was also high — 14 percent 
for males and 1 7 percent for females — com- 
pared with whites — 9 percent for males and 8 
percent for females (Broussard et al., 1991). In 
1993, 48 percent of American Indian and 
Alaska Native adults were overweight 
(National Center for Health Statistics, 1995). 

Data from the Strong Heart Study showed that 
the prevalence of overweight exceeded nation- 
al averages by 16 to 36 percent in 1988-91. 

The highest rate of overweight was among 
Arizona Indians; 4 1 percent of the men were 
obese and 26 percent were overweight. For 
women, 50 percent were obese and 30 percent 
were overweight. The waist-to-hip ratio indi- 



cated that central obesity, another major risk 
factor for heart disease, predominates in both 
sexes (Welty et al., 1995). 

In another study, the prevalence of overweight 
was 34 percent and 56 percent among Eskimo 
men and women, respectively, and 29 percent 
and 55 percent among Alaskan Indian men and 
women. A recent study of Navajo adults indi- 
cates that 51 percent of women and 33 percent 
of men are overweight (Broussard et al., 

1995). 

The prevalence of obesity was also evident 
among American Indian children, even those 
as young as 5 years old. A study of American 
Indian children age 0 to 4 participating in pub- 
lic health programs revealed that they were 
more likely to be overweight than children of 
the same age in the general population. In 
1988, 11 percent of American Indian children 
under 5 years old were overweight compared 
to 8 percent of their counterparts in the general 
population (Broussard et al., 1991). A 1990 
national survey of 9,464 American Indian 
schoolchildren age 5 to 18, excluding Navajo 
Indians, showed that the overweight preva- 
lence was high for all ages and for both sexes. 
According to this survey, the overall preva- 
lence of overweight was 39.3 percent 
(Jackson, 1993). 

Genetic predisposition is an important deter- 
minant of obesity. Studies of twins and 
adoptees have shown that body fat is transmit- 
ted genetically to a moderate extent. One study 
estimates that about 25 percent of the variation 
in body fat is genetic, and much of the varia- 
tion is due to environmental factors such as 
level of physical activity and diet (National 
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 1994). 

Neel’s “thrifty gene theory,” proposed in 1962, 
may partially explain the propensity for 
American Indians and Alaska Natives to be 
overweight and obese (Neel, 1962). This theo- 




20 



29 



ry postulates that, in order for populations to 
survive alternating periods of feast and famine, 
people developed a thrifty gene to allow them 
to store fat when food was abundant so that 
they would not starve in times of famine. With 
the introduction of a lifestyle characterized by 
a high-fat diet, less physical exercise, and a 
continuous and ample food supply, this gene 
began to work against them, continuing to 
store calories in preparation for food scarcity. 
This thrifty gene that once protected people 
from starvation also might contribute to their 
retention of unhealthy amounts of fat (National 
Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney 
Disorders, 1995a). 

Dietary Consumption Practices of 
American Indians and Alaska Natives 

Over the last 30 years, the traditional foods — 
such as com, buffalo, and venison — consumed 
by Native people have been replaced by 
processed and commercially prepared foods. 
Although there are tremendous gaps in knowl- 
edge about the contemporary consumption 
practices of American Indian tribes and Alaska 
Native communities, a few studies shed some 
light on this area. A food frequency survey 
conducted on Mvskoke Indians in Oklahoma 
showed that their diets were generally high in 
fat, calories, and sugar (Russell et al., 1994). 
Respondents stated that they ate processed 
meats, hamburger, snack chips, and sweet rolls 
on a regular basis. Meat was typically fried, 
and vegetables were usually cooked in bacon 
fat or butter. They rarely relied on hunting, 
fishing, and butchering livestock and usually 
ate traditional food only at tribal celebrations 
(Russell et al., 1994). 

Data from the Strong Heart Study (1989-91) 
showed that mean food energy intakes of par- 
ticipants were below the recommended daily 
allowance. Mean total fat intakes as a percent- 
age of calories were consistently above 30 per- 



cent of calories, and mean intakes of dietary 
fiber were below the recommended intake of 
20 to 30 grams per day for healthy adults 
(Federation of American Societies for 
Experimental Biology, 1995). This study also 
revealed numerous variations in diet among 
the three communities. The Pima Indians of 
Arizona had the highest fat and cholesterol 
consumption, but also the highest fiber intake, 
compared to the other two sites. The 
Oklahoma group overall consumed a wider 
variety of foods and more fruits and vegeta- 
bles, both fresh and canned; however, they 
also ate more beef, bacon, hot dogs, and fats 
(National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute et 
al., 1993). 

A dietary survey of Pima Indians in Arizona 
showed that their diet has been influenced by 
mainstream American foods, Mexican foods, 
and the food distribution programs operating 
in the community. For example, the typical 
American-style breakfast of eggs, bacon or 
sausage, and fried potatoes is common, as are 
Mexican-style dishes such as tacos, tamales, 
menudo (entrails soup), and chorizo (sausage). 
Staples derived from the food commodity pro- 
grams including canned meats, vegetables, and 
American cheese are reflected in typical dishes 
such as “cheese crisp” (melted cheese on a tor- 
tilla) and corned beef with gravy or potatoes. 
Hamburger and pork chops are the most wide- 
ly used meats, and the traditional Pima intake 
of legumes is evident in the combination of 
pinto beans with many foods. Pimas also eat 
white bread, flour tortillas, and fry bread (a 
type of biscuit dough formed into balls and 
fried). Traditional desert foods such as “wild 
spinach,” tepary beans, and cholla (cactus) are 
eaten infrequently and more by the older age 
groups or at community gatherings. 

The sodium intake in Pima Indians is close to 
the recommended level for adults and is gener- 



ally lower than the mean intake for the general 
population. However, Pima Indians consume 
too much of their fat as saturated fat and too 
little as polyunsaturated fat, according to the 
recommendations of the National Cholesterol 
Education Program. Moreover, the average 
cholesterol intake is far above the maximum 
recommended level of 300 mg per day (Smith 
etal., 1996). 

A 1987-88 assessment of the dietary intakes of 
Alaska Native adults from 1 1 communities 
revealed that they consumed more protein, fat, 
carbohydrates, iron, and vitamins A and C than 
the general population; however, they also 
consumed less calcium, fruits, and vegetables 
(Nobmann et al., 1992). Alaska Natives main- 
tain a heavy reliance on traditional foods and 
eating practices, consuming high amounts of 
fish and shellfish. The percentage of fat con- 
sumed was 35 to 39 percent, greater than the 
recommended level of below 30 percent. The 
major contributors of fat were fish, agutuk 
(Eskimo ice cream), beef, seal oil, whale blub- 
ber, chicken, butter, and margarine. Agutuk, 
beef, and butter contribute to the saturated 
fatty acid intake and may be an important con- 
tributor to the static rate of heart disease 
among Alaska Natives. Berries and seaweed 
are typical fruits and vegetables eaten by 
Alaska Natives; however, they generally con- 
sumed only one or two fruits or vegetables per 
day, much less than the recommended five per 
day. Dark green, yellow, and cruciferous veg- 
etables were eaten very infrequently 
(Nobmann et al., 1992). 

Alcohol Consumption 

Although considerable evidence shows that 
moderate alcohol consumption (defined as no 
more than one drink per day for most women 
and no more than two drinks per day for most 
men) decreases the risk of death from coro- 
nary artery disease, numerous studies have 
shown an association between chronic heavy 



drinking and high blood pressure, cardiomy- 
opathy, arrhythmias, and stroke (National 
Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 
1993). 

Many epidemiological studies have identified 
a positive association between alcohol intake 
(three or more drinks or roughly 40 grams of 
alcohol per day) and the level of blood pres- 
sure. Data from cross-sectional studies show 
that as much as 5 to 7 percent of the overall 
prevalence of hypertension can be attributed to 
an alcohol intake of three or more drinks per 
day (National High Blood Pressure Education 
Program, 1993b). The risk for hypertension 
among individuals drinking three or more 
drinks per day was 50 percent higher than 
among nondrinkers; the risk among individu- 
als consuming six or seven drinks per day was 
100 percent higher. A recent study also demon- 
strated that the mean systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure was 6.6 and 4.7 mm Hg higher, 
respectively, among daily drinkers than among 
individuals who drank less than once a week 
(National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and 
Alcoholism, 1993). 

Studies show that chronic alcohol consump- 
tion also is associated with increased risk of 
stroke, cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmias. 
Heavy drinking (about five drinks per day) 
increases by fourfold the risk of hemorrhagic 
stroke and may contribute to an estimated 20 
to 30 percent of cardiomyopathy cases. 
Furthermore, the high incidence of sudden 
death in alcoholics may be explained in part 
by alcohol-related arrhythmias (National 
Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 
1993). 

Alcohol-related morbidity and mortality are 
high in most American Indian populations, 
causing high rates of premature loss of life. 

For men age 45 to 64, cirrhosis is the second 
leading cause of death among American

Indians and Alaska Natives. The mortality rate 
due to cirrhosis is about twice as high for 
native men as for white men (Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, 1992). For 
native people in the IHS service area, the mor- 
tality rate is more than three times that of 
whites (Indian Health Service, 1 996). 

In 1990-92, the age-adjusted alcoholism mor- 
tality rate for the IHS service area population 
was 37.2 cases per 100,000 population. When 
the three IHS areas with problems in underre- 
porting of American Indian race on death cer- 
tificates were excluded, the age-adjusted mor- 
tality rate increased to 52.6 cases per 100,000 
population. This was 674 percent higher than 
the general population rate of 6.8 cases per 
100,000 in 1991. These rates vary by region, 
however. The mortality rate was 89.3 deaths 
per 100,000 population in the Aberdeen area 
(North Dakota and South Dakota), compared 
to 9.2 deaths per 100,000 population in the 
Oklahoma area (Indian Health Service, 

1995b). 

The 1 990 national rates showed that among 
American Indians and Alaska Natives age 45 
or older, 63 percent of men and 4 1 percent of 
women currently use alcohol (Welty et al., 
1995). Data from the Strong Heart Study, 
however, showed that participants drank less 
than these given rates: 55 percent of men and 
32 percent of women were current alcohol 
drinkers (Welty et al., 1995). On the other 
hand, the rates of heavy drinking (14 or more 
drinks per week) and binge drinking (5 or 
more drinks per occasion) were higher among 
Strong Heart Study participants who had con- 
sumed alcohol during the past year than was 
reported in national surveys (Welty et al., 

1 995). Heavy drinking and binge drinking 
have been associated with many adverse health 
events, including sudden death.

American Indian and Alaska Native 
Culture and Perceptions of Health 



An understanding of American Indian and 
Alaska Native cultures is essential to creating 
programs that are relevant, appropriate, and 
acceptable to the target population. Culture is 
the integrated pattern of knowledge, beliefs, 
and behaviors that colors the way one sees the 
world and serves as a framework within which 
individuals function throughout their daily life. 
It is the set of values that helps define the rela- 
tionship of individuals to their environment 
and to other individuals (Paniagua, 1994). 

Although the American Indian population is 
very diverse, some parallels exist in the basic 
beliefs and values many American Indians 
share. Unlike mainstream U.S. culture, which 
strongly values individualism and the nuclear 
family, American Indians and Alaska Natives 
are characterized by a strong family and com- 
munity structure. They also value harmony 
with the environment and traditional methods 
of healing. 

Social Structure 

American Indians and Alaska Natives strive 
for integration within the family, clan, and 
tribe. In contrast to the mainstream Anglo- 
American culture of nuclear family, American 
Indians value the extended family above the 
self. The familial structure is usually intergen- 
erational and includes members of the specific 
clan and tribe as well as individuals from the 
community who have made significant contri- 
butions to the family’s survival. Fathers (or 
older adults) “manage” the American Indian 



family rather than control it, unlike Asian or 
Hispanic fathers who often control their fami- 
lies by authority or machismo. American 
Indian women are highly esteemed because 
they give the gift of life. They typically serve 
as the caretakers of the family and often place 
the needs of family members before their own. 
Mutual respect between wives and husbands, 
between parents and children, and between 
family members and relatives is looked upon 
highly (Paniagua, 1994). 

Every person in the family is viewed as a sig- 
nificant component of the family structure, and 
the family provides security and protection for 
people of all ages. Elders are cherished for 
their wisdom and knowledge. They know all 
the rules necessary for social order and are 
expected to help educate the young about trib- 
al customs, history, and morals. Children are 
viewed as blessings from the creator and are 
included in almost every tribal activity 
(National Cancer Institute, 1993). 

Although strong family relationships are 
emphasized, American Indians and Alaska 
Natives also foster a sense of independence 
among family members, particularly among 
children and adolescents. For example, 
American Indian children are rarely told 
directly what to do and are often encouraged 
to make their own decisions. Few rules are 
preferred among American Indians and Alaska 
Natives; if rules exist, they should be flexible 
and loosely written (Paniagua, 1994).

Native culture consists of gift offerings and 
sharing one’s self, time, and energy with the 
family, clan, and tribe. The self is often sec- 
ondary with respect to the role of the tribe. 
Like Latinos and Asians, native people reject 
the traditional sense of individualism because 
it leads to competition among family members 
and tribe members. Rather, they emphasize the 
value of collectivism and working together to 
achieve common goals among all members of 
the tribe (Paniagua, 1 994). This sentiment 
from a Lakota woman is typical of the way 
native people perceive their social structure: 



“At the core of tribal nations is not the 
individual but the family. Without 
respect for families and children, none 
of us will survive. We need to give peo- 
ple a sense of belonging. That 's what 
makes a nation strong" (Katz, 1995). 



Concept of Time 

Many American Indians and Alaska Natives 
treat time as a natural event and do not believe 
that time should control their natural way of 
living. Time is viewed not as a measuring tool 
(e.g., hours, minutes) but rather as it relates to 
an event or task. In the same way that material 
goods are often shared, many native people 
believe that time (to fulfill a given task) must 
also be shared with others. For example, punc- 
tuality is highly valued in mainstream Western 
culture. Lack of punctuality is viewed nega- 
tively and shows a lack of respect for other 
people’s time. However, for native people, 
being late is perceived differently and can 
sometimes be a sign of respect for people. If 
someone is stopped by a person asking a ques- 
tion, that person takes the time to answer it. 
The event, then, takes priority over the clock 
(Paniagua, 1994). 



Harmony With the Environment 

Generally, American Indians and Alaska 
Natives have respect and reverence for the 
earth and all of nature, striving to live close to 
nature and its forces. The spiritual world 
includes not only humans but all living things. 
Many believe that each animal, tree, and mani- 
festation of nature has its own spirit and that a 
universal energy links all life forms, enabling 
humans to communicate spiritually with other 
living things. Care is taken not to harm or des- 
ecrate the earth. Even today, Pueblo Indians in 
Taos, New Mexico, can be seen taking shoes 
off horses and walking in soft-soled shoes 
themselves in the spring because they believe 
that the earth is pregnant at this time of year 
and her body must not be harmed (Josephy, 
1991). 

The native concept of the world is circular; 
there is no beginning and no end. The motion 
of the sun, moon, and stars across the sky is 
circular as is the life path of all creatures. The 
“circle of life” is one of the most meaningful 
symbols in American Indian life. It symbolizes 
the continuing circle of life from birth through 
adolescence, adulthood, elder years, death, and 
then rebirth (Indian Health Service, 1995a). 
The importance of the circle is evident in the 
majority of American Indian cultures. 

Religious ceremonies are performed in a cir- 
cle, and the shape of many traditional Indian 
homes is round such as the Apache wickiup, 
the Navajo hogan, and the tipi of the Plains 
Indians. 

Oral Communication 

American Indian and Alaska Native history is 
not a written history, but a spoken one. 
Through the art of storytelling, most tribes 
communicate their traditions, beliefs, and cus- 
toms to younger generations. They use Indian 
folktales and myths to teach about religious, 



26 



34 



social, and political system, habits and beliefs, 
and daily codes of conduct (Josephy, 1991). 
This oral communication, rich with life and 
meaning, is handed down through countless 
generations and plays a principal role in estab- 
lishing the individual and collective native 
identity. In some native tribes, elderly as well 
as younger women see themselves as carriers 
of culture, using the wisdom of the ancients to 
adapt to a changing world. Paula Gunn Allen 
writes: 



“My mother told me stories about 
cooking and childbearing; she told me 
stories about menstruation and preg- 
nancy; she told me stories about gods 
and heroes, about fairies and elves, 
about goddesses and spirits; she told 
me stories about the land and the sky . 

. . . She told me European stories and 
Laguna stories; she told me Catholic 
stories and Presbyterian stories; she 
told me city stories and country sto- 
ries; she told me political stories and 
religious stories. She told me stories 
about living and stories about dying. 
And in all of those stories she told me 
who I was, who I was supposed to be, 
whom I came from, and who would fol- 
low me. In this way she taught me the 
meaning of the words she said, that all 
life is a circle and everything has a 
place within it." (Katz, 1995). 



Traditional and Contemporary 
Methods of Healing 

American Indians and Alaska Natives have tra- 
ditionally cherished good health and longevity. 
Harmony with nature is important to an indi- 
vidual’s health and well-being and occurs 
simultaneously on physical, mental, and spiri- 



tual levels. A person in good health is consid- 
ered to be in a state of beauty or harmony. In 
this state, all parts of the body function per- 
fectly and feelings of well-being are felt. A 
person not in this state of harmony is consid- 
ered either sick or ill. Sickness is a more acute 
state and can be physical, mental, social, or 
environmental in nature. Physical sickness 
includes colds, bums, skin rashes, and broken 
bones. Illness, on the other hand, is considered 
more serious than sickness and comes about 
slowly, lingers for a long time, and has no dis- 
cemable cause (National Cancer Institute, 
1993). 

Traditionally, many tribes incorporated health 
and sickness concepts into their basic religious 
principles. Traditional beliefs defined then- 
social origins, their relationships with the 
supernatural, and the nature of the universe. 
Tribes believed that supernatural powers 
assisted them in overcoming numerous envi- 
ronmental and social hardships. By performing 
mundane behaviors according to a prescribed 
order, they were guaranteed spiritual, social, 
and physical well-being. Trouble of any kind 
was a direct consequence of either a breach of 
the “prescribed order” or evil spirits causing a 
person’s disharmony. American Indian people 
revered tribal healers because they believed 
that the healer was given special powers to 
control or counteract the negative powers from 
the human or spiritual world that caused ill- 
ness (National Cancer Institute, 1993). 

Many American Indians and Alaska Natives 
continue to have the old attitudes about health 
and illness, and traditional healing is still prac- 
ticed by most cultures. Traditional healing is a 
holistic approach that involves treating the 
body, mind and spirit of the individual in addi- 
tion to their symptoms and physical manifesta- 
tions. Tribal healers use herbs and teas, as well 
as prayers to spirits and ritual incantations to 
treat their patients’ symptoms. Oral communi- 




. 35 



27 



cation with the spirits, or “sing” is also used to 
prevent sickness or illness when it is known 
that an individual will come into contact with 
objects or malignant forces (National Cancer 
Institute, 1993). 

American Indians and Alaska Natives often 
incorporate both traditional healing and 
Western methods of healing. They have 
accepted the Anglo doctor’s role in their heal- 
ing process, but relegate the doctor to the lim- 
ited role of “the treater of symptoms rather 
than the curer.” It is understandable, therefore, 
why native people go to Anglo doctors primar- 
ily for symptomatic treatment with antibiotics 
and other quick painkillers rather than for sus- 
tained medical care (National Cancer Institute, 
1993).

Community-Based Health Promotion and 
Disease Prevention Programs for 
American Indians and Alaska Natives 



This section highlights some key prevention 
and intervention programs that have been 
developed to address the cardiovascular health 
of American Indians and Alaska Natives. 

These programs are not meant to depict the 
entirety of programs available for this popula- 
tion but serve only as a representative sample 
of existing programs. 

Strong Heart Study 

The Strong Heart Study, a 
research study sponsored by the 
National Heart, Lung, and Blood 
Institute of the National 
Institutes of Health, is designed to estimate 
mortality and morbidity from cardiovascular 
disease and to determine the prevalence of 
known and suspected cardiovascular risk fac- 
tors in American Indians. This is the first study 
of its kind to compare levels of cardiovascular 
risk factors among diverse American Indian 
populations. The risk factors examined were 
high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, 
diabetes, obesity, physical inactivity, smoking, 
and alcohol consumption. The project consist- 
ed of three components: death record reviews, 
medical record reviews for previous hospital 
and clinical visits, and physical examinations 
of people age 45 to 74. More than 4,500 par- 
ticipants from 1 2 tribes were examined at three 
sites in central Arizona, southwestern 
Oklahoma, and the Aberdeen area of North 
Dakota and South Dakota. 

To accomplish this enormous task of recruiting 
participants, tribal councils and the Bureau of 



Indian Affairs were consulted regarding enu- 
meration of the study. Significant assistance 
also was provided by the Indian Health Ser- 
vice, the National Institute of Diabetes and 
Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and the U.S. 
Army. The Strong Heart Study made every 
attempt to involve the participating communi- 
ties. The project provided employment oppor- 
tunities for American Indians in the local com- 
munity to serve on the staff. Community meet- 
ings were held periodically to apprise commu- 
nity members of the project’s status and any 
preliminary data collected. Community mem- 
bers also had an opportunity to provide valu- 
able feedback to the investigators on the study 
procedures. The Strong Heart Study distrib- 
uted a quarterly newsletter as another commu- 
nications mechanism. 

To boost recruitment efforts, evening and 
Saturday clinics were held to accommodate 
participants who were unavailable during the 
regular hours. At one site, exams were con- 
ducted at an apartment located within an elder- 
ly housing complex. The Strong Heart Study 
also participated in community events and 
health fairs. The project was invited to cohost 
the First Annual Intertribal Dialysis Associ- 
ation and Foundation powwow in 1991. 

The Strong Heart Study received overwhelm- 
ing support from community leaders and mem- 
bers in all three sites. Most of the prominent 
community members who were eligible for the 
project participated, thus setting an important 
example for other community members. Even 
people who were not eligible for the study 




O 

ERLC 



37 



29 



were aware of the value of the project to the 
community. A major reason for the success 
and the relatively low cost of the project was 
the cooperation and partnerships developed 
between the National Heart, Lung, and Blood 
Institute (the funding institute); other Govern- 
ment agencies; and participating tribes. 

Pathways 

PATHWAYS is a multisite school-based obesi- 
ty prevention program designed to reduce the 
prevalence of obesity in school-aged children 
by promoting healthful eating and physical 
activity. It is the first childhood obesity pre- 
vention study of its kind to be executed in the 
United States under rigorous scientific meth- 
ods. Conducted in cooperation with seven 
reservations in Arizona, New Mexico, and 
South Dakota and five universities, PATH- 
WAYS is a two-phase study consisting of a 3- 
year planning and development phase and a 
larger, full-scale study. 

The classroom curriculum for grades 3, 4, and 
5 teaches children the importance of healthful 
eating and physical activity; a school meal 
program and a physical activity/education pro- 
gram give children an opportunity to apply 
their knowledge; and family involvement rein- 
forces children’s health behaviors. The out- 
come measures for this program include chil- 
dren’s knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors 
about health, nutrition, and physical activity; 
an assessment of their growth and develop- 
ment; their eating and physical activity pat- 
terns; and the nutrient content of school meals. 

The first phase of the project recently has been 
completed and is awaiting complete data 
analysis before implementation of the full- 
scale study. Its success was based on meticu- 
lous attention paid to cultural sensitivity, acces- 
sibility to healthful food and exercise options, 
privacy and confidentiality of individuals, and 



respect for the existing school and tribal infra- 
structure. The project received approval from 
the tribal councils, universities and tribal 
review boards, the local Bureau of Indian 
Affairs, the Indian Health Service, and partici- 
pating school boards before it was initiated. 

Every effort was made to involve key tribal, 
community, and school individuals in advising 
the researchers on the conduct of the study and 
to include American Indians among research 
project staff. Individual and group interviews 
were conducted to obtain input on tailoring the 
program to suit the needs of the individual 
sites. The program components were pilot-test- 
ed, and the community had the opportunity to 
provide input that was then used to revise the 
components. The schools also participated in 
developing measurement methods for evaluat- 
ing the effectiveness of the program. PATH- 
WAYS is sponsored by the National Heart, 
Lung, and Blood Institute. 

Checkerboard Cardiovascular 
Curriculum 

The Checkerboard Cardiovascular Curriculum 
was an intervention designed to increase car- 
diovascular health knowledge among fifth- 
grade children in rural New Mexico, primarily 
Pueblo and Navajo American Indians and 
Latinos. Students learned about cardiovascular 
health, with an emphasis on reducing high-risk 
behavior, by participating in 8 to 10 weekly 
meetings of about 2 hours. A team-teaching 
approach was used, and lessons were taught by 
a graduate student, health educators, and other 
health professionals. This culturally rich cur- 
riculum incorporated information on American 
Indian traditions about running and exercise, 
and the traditional American Indian and Latino 
diet. Children were encouraged to share stories 
about traditional philosophies of running and 
fitness and to interview grandparents about tra- 
ditional Indian life. Elders also were invited to 



30 



38 



classrooms to cook traditional, heart-healthy 
foods and to talk about the cultural importance 
of physical activity and fitness. Students were 
challenged to exercise at home, and all stu- 
dents at one school participated in a distance 
run. Efforts were made to adapt the curriculum 
to each culture. The project showed positive 
outcomes. Students at all schools showed a 
significant gain in knowledge, many students 
increased their exercise, and many also 
decreased their 1 -mile walk or run time. 
Followup sessions revealed students’ interest 
in continuing the program (Harris et al., 1988). 

Zuni Diabetes Project 

The Zuni Diabetes Project, a community-based 
exercise and weight control program, is 
designed to encourage weight loss and 
improve glycemic control in people with dia- 
betes. Initiated by the Indian Health Service in 
July 1983, the project is now managed by the 
Zuni Wellness Center, a tribally owned pro- 
gram. The center offers weightlifting circuit 
training and a gym for basketball, volleyball, 
and aerobics classes. The center has expanded 
from providing 2 aerobic exercise sessions per 
week to offering more than 48 sessions 5 days 
a week in several sites in the Zuni community. 
Weekly clinics are held in conjunction with the 
exercise classes to monitor weight, serum glu- 
cose, and blood pressure. Special incentive 




Traditional dancing keeps the heart strong 



events are also held, such as running, walking, 
and bicycling programs; annual weight loss 
competitions; and annual fitness challenges. 
Zuni aerobic instructors are employed and 
serve as role models. Participation in the pro- 
gram is promoted through personal invitations, 
recommendations from the medical staff, and a 
general community advertisement campaign. 

To increase accessibility and encourage more 
participation, the center also provides trans- 
portation for the community. 

In 1987, the Zuni Diabetes Project, in conjunc- 
tion with the Eat Right New Mexico cam- 
paign, held a weight loss competition in the 
Zuni and Navajo communities. Eat Right is a 
statewide nutrition education and weight con- 
trol program implemented by the Healthnet 
New Mexico health promotion organization. A 
total of 249 people completed the 10-week 
program. Elements of the program included 
team competition, goal-setting, weekly weigh- 
in sessions with results posted on display 
boards, exercise logs, and behavior checklists. 

Results from the program were extremely 
promising. Not only did 92 percent of the reg- 
istered participants complete the 10- week pro- 
gram, but most people also exceeded the pro- 
gram’s weight loss goal and managed to keep 
the weight off after a 50-week followup peri- 
od. The participants’ mean blood glucose val- 
ues also dropped significantly, and they were 
more than two times as likely to have 
decreased their diabetes medication as the non- 
participants. 

This study demonstrated that a community- 
based exercise program can be an effective 
way to facilitate weight loss and improve 
metabolic control in a group of American 
Indians with non-insulin-dependent diabetes 
mellitus. The weight loss competition proved 
to be an inexpensive strategy for facilitating 
weight loss and behavior change. It enhanced

and strengthened social support systems, 
which in turn stimulated interest and increased 
commitment among team members (Heath et 
al., 1991). 

Southwestern Cardiovascular 
Curriculum 

The Southwestern Cardiovascular Curriculum 
(SCC) is a multifactorial, culturally oriented 
curriculum created for American Indian stu- 
dents in rural northwestern New Mexico. 
Funded by a grant from the National Heart, 
Lung, and Blood Institute, the curriculum 
increases knowledge and promotes healthy 
behavior changes by teaching students lifetime 
skills to promote healthy habits. The curricu- 
lum focuses on physiology, nutrition, physical 
activity, and the effects of tobacco use. Kids 
also engage in skill-building activities and 
role-playing to teach them to resist peer pres- 
sure and other social influences. Hardiness is 
emphasized as an important tradition of 
American Indian people. As part of an inter- 
generational component of the curriculum, 
elders from the local community lead class- 
room discussions on the values of traditional 
foods and the cultural importance of both 
physical and spiritual well-being. Emphasis is 
placed on the traditional American Indian use 
of tobacco. School teachers and administrators 
are trained to teach the curriculum by attend- 
ing a 2-day seminar. 

Preliminary data from evaluation studies show 
that students experience positive changes in 
health knowledge, attitudes, and behavior. The 
curriculum helped schools meet their goals for 
the Healthy Kids for the Year 2000 program 
and the school-related objectives of the U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services for 
educating children about nutrition, physical 
activity, and tobacco. The educators’ training 
workshop increased teachers’ knowledge and 
skills in health and multicultural education, 



and food service employees were given addi- 
tional training in selecting and preparing 
healthful foods. 

NIDDK Diabetes Prevention Program 

The National Institute of Diabetes and 
Digestive and Kidney Disorders (NIDDK) has 
implemented a multicenter clinical study to 
determine if diabetes can be prevented or 
delayed. In preparation for this multicenter 
study, the NIDDK conducted a pilot study 
with two groups of Pima Indians who are free 
of diabetes and have normal glucose tolerance 
tests. The two groups were called Pima Action 
and Pima Pride. The Pima Action group mem- 
bers participated in discussions on healthy tra- 
ditional behaviors involving nutrition and 
exercise and were encouraged to eat a low-fat, 
high-fiber diet that included beans, fruits, and 
vegetables. They were also prompted to exer- 
cise 3 hours a week in leisure and occupation- 
al activities and to record their activities in a 
journal. Most participants exercised or worked 
in groups when possible to maintain motiva- 
tion and morale. Program staff met with study 
volunteers at 3-, 6-, and 12-month intervals to 
measure their progress. 

Whereas members of the Pima Action group 
focused on weight loss, the Pima Pride group 
participants focused on discovering ancestral 
values and lifestyles and determining their rel- 
evance to their own lives. These participants 
attended presentations by community members 
and others to learn more about their ancestors’ 
healthy diets and lifestyles. 

Results from these pilot studies have been 
promising; participants are eager to make 
healthy lifestyle changes. Upon completion of 
data analysis for the pilot study, the 
researchers plan to develop an intervention 
incorporating several other treatments and the 
best aspects of the Pima Pride and Pima

Action programs (National Institute of Dia- 
betes and Digestive and Kidney Disorders, 
1995a). 

Nutrition Assistants Program 

The Indian Health Service, in collaboration 
with the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
(USDA), has developed the Nutrition 
Assistants Program to prepare paraprofession- 
als in nutrition education. These paraprofes- 
sionals are chosen from reservation communi- 
ties to serve as role models and educators for 
other community members. Through home 
visits and community activities, these nutrition 
assistants teach people to prepare and store 
food in healthy ways. One week of formal 
training and followup training sessions are 
provided, which are adapted to suit the 
lifestyles of people living in American Indian 
country. College credit is offered in some sites 
for nutrition assistants taking the classes. The 
advantage of using paraprofessionals is their 
cultural sensitivity and their ability to relate to 
the target audience because they are members 
of the target audience. 

Food Distribution Program on Indian 
Reservations 

The Food Distribution Program on Indian 
Reservations (FDPIR) provides food com- 
modities to low-income American Indian and 
Alaska Native families living on or near reser- 
vations. It is an alternative to the Food Stamp 
Program for people who do not have easy 
access to food stores. The program is adminis- 
tered by the USDA in cooperation with State 
agencies. The USDA provides food to the 
State agencies, which are responsible for food 
storage and distribution, eligibility certifica- 
tion, and nutrition education. Families receive 
monthly packages of basic supplemental foods 
such as canned meat and fish products, canned 
fruits and vegetables, dried beans, dairy prod- 



ucts, grain products, fats, and sugar (U.S. 
Department of Agriculture, 1994). 

In 1986, the USDA revised the food package 
by lowering the levels of fats and sugar in the 
food and increasing the nutrient and energy 
content. The agency recently launched two 
pilot programs to add frozen ground beef and 
fresh fruits and vegetables as alternatives to 
canned products in the food package. These 
products have never been available before due 
to the lack of transportation and storage facili- 
ties. However, the USDA partnered with the 
U.S. Department of Defense, an agency able to 
procure fresh produce and deliver it directly to 
tribes. In addition, a significant nutrition edu- 
cation component has been created that 
includes culturally appropriate fact sheets and 
recipes detailing storage, handling, and prepa- 
ration of the new foods. Nutrition and cooking 
demonstrations are being designed and imple- 
mented by individual tribes to meet the specif- 
ic needs of each area. Both pilot programs 
have met with huge success and are being 
expanded to include additional sites. The pro- 
vision of these new products will allow FDPIR 
participants — who do not have access to inex- 
pensive or good quality fresh fruits, vegeta- 
bles, and meat — to enhance the nutritional 
benefits in their diet and enjoy a greater vari- 
ety in their food choices (U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, 1993, 1996). 

Wings of America 

Wings of America, established in 1988, is an 
American Indian youth development program 
of the Earth Circle Foundation, Inc., based in 
Santa Fe, New Mexico. In partnership with 
American Indian communities, the program 
uses running as a catalyst to empower 
American Indian youth to identify with their 
heritage and take pride in themselves, leading 
to increased self-esteem, health, and wellness. 
Wings of America holds running and fitness 



camps for children and adolescents. These 
camps teach life management and leadership 
skills, running and fitness techniques, sub- 
stance abuse prevention, and good nutrition. 
The children are also taught traditional 
American Indian games. College-aged Wings 
of America runners facilitate the children’s 
camps, and high school runners serve as peer 
leaders and role models. 

Wings of America also sponsors teams of high 
school runners to the U.S.A. Track and Field 
National Cross Country Championship each 
year. The program showcases the talents of 
American Indian youth at this event and offers 
them a cross-cultural experience. To date, 
Wings of America runners have captured eight 
national junior titles since 1988 and have 
achieved national recognition. The program is 
currently developing model fitness and health 
programs to be implemented at the community 
levels through existing youth, health, wellness, 
school, and drug elimination programs. For 
example, Wings of America is working with 
the eight Northern Indian Pueblo Day Schools 
on the Gila River Reservation to supplement 
their health and physical fitness programs and 
to coordinate an all-schools track and field 
day. The program receives funding through the 
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development’s Drug Elimination Program 
(Wings of America, 1996).

Recommended Strategies for 
Effective Programs 



This section discusses some key elements to 
consider in designing community-based health 
promotion programs for American Indians and 
Alaska Natives. These strategies are based on 
findings from intervention studies on Ameri- 
can Indians and Alaska Natives, experiences of 
actual programs, and expert interviews. These 
highlighted strategies are not displayed in pri- 
ority order and do not represent the universe of 
successful program strategies. 

Incorporate community culture, 

LIFESTYLE, AND VALUES. 

Successful interventions are tailored to the 
preferences and daily activities of the target 
population. For native people, the cultural 
value of family and tribe takes priority over 
the self; therefore, interventions that are fami- 
ly-centered rather than self-centered may be 
better accepted by the community. Activities 
involving participation from parents, children, 
grandparents, and extended family are very 
appealing. The special relationship between 
grandparents and grandchildren also can serve 
as an effective avenue for learning and health 
behavior change. 

Women can be a viable channel for transmit- 
ting health messages to family members. They 
are often considered the educators and healers 
of the family. Interventions placed in the con- 
text of how behavior change will help their 
children and their families are more likely to 
be accepted because women value the preser- 
vation of the family and of generations to 



come. For example, a woman is more likely to 
exercise and to eat less fatty food so that she 
will be a live mentor for the family (National 
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute et al., 1993). 

Powwows and other tribal rituals can and 
should be incorporated into programs whenev- 
er possible. Powwows are one of the most vis- 
ible expressions of “Indianness,” and are 
simultaneously social gatherings, celebrations, 
family reunions, and occasions for spiritual 
renewal (Reader’s Digest, 1995). Once begun 
as tribal celebrations, powwows have evolved 
into truly pan-Indian forms, blending traditions 
drawn from numerous tribes. American 
Indians from inner cities and remote reserva- 
tions alike come together to celebrate their 
identity in song, dance, and costume. These 
powwows can be found nationwide. One of 
the biggest powwows is the Red Earth Festival 
held each June in Oklahoma City (Viola, 

1990). 

Gain community support. 

Historically, numerous researchers have used 
American Indian and Alaska Native tribes to 
conduct their research studies without sharing 
the information they gained with the tribes 
themselves. Over time, this behavior provoked 
mistrust of researchers and science among 
native people. Suspicion and mistrust still per- 
sist today but have been somewhat remedied 
by researchers who have developed a working 
relationship with their target audience and 
have included community members in the 
intervention’s planning and implementation.

The principle of participation is of utmost 
importance to the American Indian and Alaska 
Native population. When policies and priori- 
ties are developed at the national level but 
depend on local institutions for their execu- 
tion, planners must make every effort to solicit 
active participation, input, and even endorse- 
ment from the tribal leaders and the communi- 
ty they are working with prior to collaborating 
on any research, training, or educational 
efforts. 

Gaining community support is essential to sus- 
tain an effective intervention effort. 
Community members add credibility and visi- 
bility to the project and can provide informa- 
tion on the cultural values, customs, and health 
beliefs and practices. They also can identify 
key community leaders, communication net- 
works, and local experts who might be useful 
to the program. 

One way to organize a working group of opin- 
ion leaders is to establish a community or trib- 
al advisory board whose members can assist in 
planning and implementing the program. 

These advisory boards typically include people 
who will be most affected by the intervention. 
These people may be tribal government lead- 
ers, elders, medicine men and medicine 
women, primary care providers, community 
health representatives, and members of the tar- 
get population. 

Community members should be involved in all 
stages of the intervention. Early community 
involvement in setting goals and priorities as 
well as in program planning provides the 
opportunity for ownership, which can lead to a 
sense of empowerment and self-determination. 
Community members can be enlisted to con- 
duct their own community needs assessment, 
and they can serve on focus groups to provide 
valuable insights into the target audience’s 
health beliefs and practices. Working groups 



also can help develop concepts, messages, and 
images to ensure cultural relevance. Native 
people also can work as trusted and accepted 
staff members who work directly with pro- 
gram participants. In addition, they can pro- 
vide feedback to researchers about benefits to 
subjects from participating in interventions. 

With training and support, these American 
Indian and Alaska Native participants can 
evolve into a community-based coalition that 
not only addresses CVD prevention but other 
health issues as well. Joanne Kauffman, in a 
forum addressing minority health issues, said: 



“There is an awakening among Indian 
people about the importance of tribe , 
about the importance of community . 
Coalitions based on tribal culture can 
help Indian people deal with the need 
for \ spiritual wellness ' in their commu- 
nities .... The power of communities, 
the power of tribe, the power of a 
group, I think, can make a tremendous 
difference for people of color " 
(National Heart, Lung, and Blood 
Institute et al, 1993). 



fH Develop partnerships within the target 

COMMUNITY AND WITH OTHER FEDERAL, 

State, and local organizations. 

A new program implemented within the con- 
fines of existing organizations in the commu- 
nity can utilize established infrastructures and 
viable local networks to reach the target popu- 
lation. Partnerships with local institutions who 
already affect the community will strengthen 
the program’s credibility and receptivity. 
Program planners must be knowledgeable of 
the role and impact of the health care delivery 



36 



44 



system of the American Indian and Alaska 
Native community. Both the IHS and tribal 
governments operate service units to adminis- 
ter to the health needs of most American 
Indians, and Indian-operated urban units cater 
to the needs of urban Indians. However, con- 
sideration must be given to the health needs of 
many native people who do not receive their 
health care through these channels. Partnering 
with these and other health care organizations 
is key to expanding the reach of the interven- 
tion to the target population. In addition, limi- 
tations in resources, abilities, and time may be 
offset by cooperative arrangements with other 
local agencies or larger organizations at the 
State or national levels. 

Planners also should enlist traditional medi- 
cine men and medicine women in program 
development and implementation in communi- 
ties where they are respected and consulted. 
Planners should recognize existing traditional 
health beliefs and practices, acknowledge their 
potential benefits, and attempt to work with 
them rather than against or despite them. 

Community health representatives (CHRs) 
have been a successful channel for disseminat- 
ing health information to American Indians 
and Alaska Natives. CHRs are paraprofession- 
als who are trained as outreach workers to 
assist in providing health care, health promo- 
tion, and disease prevention services. The 
CHR program was initiated in 1 968 by the 
IHS to improve the health conditions of many 
native communities. Many remote reservation 
tribes lacked accessibility to health care and 
had a low acceptance level of the modem 
health care system being delivered by the IHS. 
The CHR program bridged the geographic and 
cultural gap that alienated many American 
Indians. 

CHRs are in the unique position to be more 
culturally sensitive to the needs of native peo- 
ple because they are selected from and 



0 




employed in their own communities and are 
usually well-known, respected role models 
from their communities (Cleaver et al., 1989). 
Using CHRs in planning and implementing a 
program provides not only a channel to dis- 
seminate CVD information, but also a feed- 
back mechanism to gain valuable insights 
about whether the program is achieving its 
goals. 

■1 Develop and disseminate culturally 

APPROPRIATE MATERIALS. 

An accurate assessment of the target audi- 
ence’s CVD knowledge, their values and 
health beliefs, their literacy level, and their 
language preference is important before devel- 
oping educational materials or messages. 

Direct community input can enhance a pro- 
gram’s ability to design materials that address 
the specific needs of the target population. 

Members of some tribes only speak traditional 
tribal languages. Therefore, consider the feasi- 
bility of developing materials in tribal lan- 
guages. It is best to create materials using trib- 
al language from the beginning. If the English- 
language materials are translated, only experi- 
enced translators should be used. Direct trans- 
lations generally are not successful in commu- 
nicating the intended message and may offend 
the target audience (National Heart, Lung, and 
Blood Institute, 1996a). 



“All peoples and cultures relate best to 
and are most influenced by that which 
is familiar. Achieving a goal of improv- 
ed health for American Indian and 
Alaska Native people requires the use 
of learning materials that are both cul- 
turally sensitive and relevant to local 
lifestyles." (Michael H. Trujillo, M.D., 
M.P.H, M.S. Assistant Surgeon General; 
Director, Indian Health Service). 



45 



37 



For American Indians and Alaska Natives, it is 
best to use message concepts that incorporate 
traditional Indian values that give cultural 
reinforcement and a sense of identity. Themes 
like “love of family,” “maintaining indepen- 
dence,” or “remaining strong” focus on the 
orientation of native people toward family and 
community and the viability of future genera- 
tions. Emphasis should be on integrating tradi- 
tional ways and lifestyles. For example, mes- 
sages on physical activity should emphasize 
the Native traditions of running, dancing, and 
walking as a means of achieving physical and 
spiritual fitness. Likewise, messages to pro- 
mote healthier diets should emphasize the tra- 
ditional American Indian diet that is higher in 
complex carbohydrates and fiber and lower in 
sugar and fat. Messages also should have a 
present-time orientation because, for many 
native people, the present is more important 
than the future. Themes that focus on the 
future may not be as effective as those that 
emphasize the importance of making health 
behavior changes now (Paniagua, 1994; 
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 
1996a). 

When developing educational materials, it is 
important to assess the literacy level of the tar- 
get population. For low-literacy audiences, 
written materials should use simple words, 
short sentences, and concrete concepts. 

Graphic illustrations maximize comprehension 
of key messages. One-page fact sheets and 
short brochures appear to be more effective 
than longer pamphlets for this audience. For 
many American Indian and Alaska Native 
audiences, television and videos are other 
effective vehicles for disseminating health 
messages. Television and videos can capture 
reflections of life and touch the viewer’s heart 
in a way that the written word cannot. Any 
written or visual materials should include 
images of American Indians and Alaska 



Natives and reflections of their art and music. 
Generic pan-Indian pictures and symbols 
should be used to reflect the diversity of the 
Native population. In these messages, it is of 
utmost importance to place people in a posi- 
tive context that makes them proud of their 
heritage. 

The use of tribal elders as spokespersons in 
program interventions is an effective way to 
reach the target audience. Elders are well 
respected by all members of the community, 
especially the young. They are credible sources 
to teach about native traditions and to promote 
traditional family teachings and practices. 

The channels best suited for disseminating 
information include powwows, Indian Health 
Service clinics, urban centers, reservation trad- 
ing posts, grocery stores, recreational centers, 
and trade stores. Head Start and WIC pro- 
grams and schools are avenues for reaching 
American Indian and Alaska Native youth 
(National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 
1987). A number of associations and networks 
in the radio, television, and newspaper arenas 
may have access to the target audiences. In 
addition to mass media, community volun- 
teers, CHRs, and nutrition aides can be used to 
reinforce the message to the target audience. 
The value placed on the gift of one’s time can- 
not be overemphasized in the native communi- 
ty. Interpersonal communication is a key 
aspect to the success of an intervention. 

The health risk appraisal (HRA), used primari- 
ly in occupational settings and at health fairs, 
is a health survey that can be used to identify 
individuals in need of health education materi- 
als. An Indian-specific HRA called “Finding 
the Way” was developed in 1988, based on a 
health risk appraisal developed by the Carter 
Center and the Centers for Disease Control, 
and has been distributed throughout the Indian 
Health Service. This HRA can and has been 




38 



46 



used in community and clinical settings to 
motivate American Indians and Alaska Natives 
to adopt healthier lifestyles and to take more 
responsibility for their health. For example, 
HRAs have been used extensively at health 
fairs to provide individuals with a profile of 
their health risks and recommendations for 
adopting healthy lifestyles. HRAs also can be 
administered to outpatients waiting for their 
appointment with their health care provider. 
Health educators or CHRs can assist in inter- 
preting the survey and providing patients with 
appropriate health education materials. The 
appraisal can be filed with the patient’s med- 
ical record for future reference and reinforce- 
ment by health care providers (Welty, 1988, 
1989). 

Remove existing barriers. 

One of the greatest barriers to participating in 
health programs is lack of accessibility. 
American Indians and Alaska Natives in both 
rural and urban settings are typically under- 
served. At places that do have program sites, 
many people have no mode of transportation 
to the site. In some geographic locations, 
extreme weather conditions preclude program 
participation by community members. Lack of 
transportation or extreme weather conditions, 
rather than a lack of interest on the part of 
community members, are some of the factors 
responsible for some programs not reaching 
their target audiences. 

Planners should work in cooperation with 
schools to make exercise facilities available 
for native youth. Incorporating program activi- 
ties into the existing academic structure will 
improve the chances that these activities will 
be sustained long after the program funding 
has ended. 

Another barrier that should be addressed in the 
American Indian community is the lack of 
affordable grocery stores for purchasing fresh 



fruits, vegetables, and meats. Programs 
emphasizing a return to a traditional Indian 
diet would likely fail to change food behaviors 
if traditional Indian foods are unavailable. The 
USD A has improved its food commodity pro- 
gram with the addition of fresh fruits, vegeta- 
bles, and meats in some Indian communities. 
The agency also intends to review and make 
recommended changes to the food package in 
the near future. Coalition-building and com- 
munity action is needed to influence grocery 
store owners on or near reservations to 
increase the variety of food products and to 
change pricing policies. Another method to 
circumvent this accessibility barrier is to 
develop communal fruit, vegetable, and herb 
gardens, which are shared and maintained by 
many community members. This option gives 
individuals an opportunity not only to be phys- 
ically active, but also to commune with nature 
and share the fruits of their labors with other 
community members. 



Theoretical Models 



Theoretical models provide a necessary frame- 
work from which to develop effective health 
promotion programs. Because not all models 
can comprehensively address the specific 
needs of the intended program, a combination 
of models is often used. This section briefly 
discusses aspects of five models that can be 
incorporated into the development of health 
promotion programs targeting American 
Indians and Alaska Natives. 

PRECEDE Model 

Green and Kreuter’s PRECEDE Model (1991) 
uses a multidimensional approach to address 
behavioral and environmental factors that 
influence health behavior. The PRECEDE 
Model groups behavioral and environmental 
factors into three broad categories: predispos- 
ing, enabling, and reinforcing factors. 

Predisposing factors are the knowledge, cultur- 
al beliefs, values, and perceived abilities of an 
individual or group that facilitate or hinder 
motivation for change. A heightened aware- 
ness of one’s cardiovascular risk may be the 
first step in influencing one’s health behavior. 
This knowledge, accompanied by sufficient 
motivation, is an essential factor in changing 
individual or collective behavior. Understand- 
ing the target audience’s level of knowledge 
about cardiovascular disease and its risk fac- 
tors, their attitude toward engaging in health- 
promoting behaviors, and the beliefs and val- 
ues they place on health and disease is funda- 
mental to developing a culturally relevant and 
appropriate program. 



Enabling factors are environmental conditions 
that enhance or hinder desired behavioral 
changes. These factors are usually the targets 
of community organization and program inter- 
vention. A group’s health behaviors are depen- 
dent on the availability, accessibility, and 
affordability of the product causing the health 
problem. Similarly, their ability to adopt new 
health behaviors is limited to the degree to 
which health resources are available, accessi- 
ble, and affordable. This issue is especially 
pertinent in programs targeting American 
Indians and Alaska Natives living on reserva- 
tions and in villages. The remoteness of health 
care facilities, lack of transportation, and 
extreme weather conditions are environmental 
enabling factors that affect the availability and 
hinder accessibility to health care services. 
People in urban areas also suffer from lack of 
necessary clinical preventive services. 

The Food Distribution Program on Indian 
Reservations (FDPIR) is an example of an 
enabling factor that affects the dietary behav- 
iors of American Indians and Alaska Natives. 
The FDPIR was established by the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture (USDA) in 1977 to 
provide supplemental food commodities to 
low-income native families living on or near 
reservations. Families receive monthly pack- 
ages of canned fruits and vegetables, canned 
meat and fish products, dried beans, dairy 
products, grain products, fats, and sugar. A 
1990 evaluation of the FDPIR showed that 
approximately 65 to 70 percent of American 
Indians and Alaska Natives living on reserva- 




48 



41 



tions received either food commodities or food 
stamps. However, participation in the FDPIR 
program does not guarantee nutrient-dense 
foods or a variety of foods, however. This pro- 
gram is designed as a supplemental food 
source, and recipients are expected to purchase 
a portion of their monthly food supply. 
Unfortunately, for many families, limited 
access to grocery stores, minimal food choices 
in available stores, and lack of refrigeration 
result in complete dependence on commodity 
foods (National Cancer Institute, 1993). 

The ability to perform new skills is also an 
enabling factor needed to change a health 
behavior. These skills may include the ability 
to measure one’s blood pressure or to perform 
appropriate physical exercises. An assessment 
of the target audience’s skills can give plan- 
ners valuable insight into possible program 
components. 

Reinforcing factors include the positive and 
negative feedback people obtain from others 
following the adoption of the behavior. These 
factors include family and social support, peer 
influence, and real or perceived positive or 
negative consequences of the behavior. 

Social benefits (e.g., praise, recognition) and 
physical benefits (e.g., comfort, relief from 
pain) are factors that reinforce behavior. 
Reinforcing factors also include adverse con- 
sequences of behavior, or punishment, which 
can lead to the extinction of a positive behav- 
ior. Incorporating activities in a program that 
reinforce positive health behaviors will more 
likely lead to permanent behavior change. It is 
important to determine what the target com- 
munity values. For example, many native peo- 
ple are very family-oriented and highly value 
elders and children. Family-oriented programs 
that involve the participation of some or all 
family members in changing behavior may be 
more successful than programs that focus on 
the individual. 



Health Belief Model 

The Health Belief Model attempts to explain 
health behavior in terms of specific belief pat- 
terns (Green and Kreuter, 1991). The model is 
based on the following assumptions about 
behavior change. 

♦ The person must believe that he or she is 
susceptible to disease and that his or her 
health is in jeopardy. 

♦ The person must perceive the potential seri- 
ousness of the condition (i.e., pain or dis- 
comfort, lost productivity, economic con- 
straints). 

♦ The person must believe that the benefits of 
changing his or her behavior outweigh the 
barriers. The person also must believe that 
the change is possible and within his or her 
grasp. 

♦ There must be a precipitating force that 
compels the person to feel the need to take 
action. 

Social Learning Theory 

The Social Learning Theory explains human 
behavior in terms of a reciprocal interaction 
among cognitive, behavioral, and environmen- 
tal determinants (Bandura, 1977). It suggests 
that people not only react to external influ- 
ences but also proactively create and regulate 
their own environment. People learn through 
direct experience, through vicarious experi- 
ence by observing others, and through their 
cognitive ability to plan goals, anticipate con- 
sequences, and assess their own capabilities. 
The cognitive process of appraising one’s own 
ability to perform a behavior successfully is 
called self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is an impor- 
tant factor in determining whether behavior 
change takes place. Self-efficacy explains how 
people set standards for themselves in chang- 
ing their behaviors and how mental barriers 



42 



49 




can hinder their ability to change. Planners 
should consider activities that foster self-effi- 
cacy in individuals when developing health 
promotion programs. For example, programs 
can include setting goals for behavior change 
in small increments so that participants are 
more likely to succeed in their new behaviors. 

Theory of Reasoned Action 

Lewin’s Theory of Reasoned Action holds that 
the final step in the predisposing process 
before actual action takes place is formulating 
a behavioral intention (Green and Kreuter, 
1991). A person’s intention to perform a 
behavior depends on three things: (1) his or 
her attitudes toward the behavior, (2) his or her 
perception of social norms favoring the behav- 
ior, and (3) his or her motivation to comply 
with these social norms. To change a person’s 
behavioral intention and thus their actual 
behavior, one must change one or all of the 
attitudinal, normative, or motivation-to-com- 
ply factors. 

Stages of Change Model 

People do not change chronic behaviors imme- 
diately, but instead change their habitual 
behavior over time. In Prochaska and 
DiClemente’s Stages of Change Model, people 
are categorized into four stages of behavior 
change (Prochaska et al., 1994). The first 
stage, precontemplation, is a condition in 
which people have not thought of or are not 
interested in change. In the second stage, con- 
templation, people give serious thought to 
changing behavior. Action, the third stage, is 
the 6-month period after an overt effort to 
change has been made. Finally, maintenance is 
the period from 6 months after a behavior 
change until the behavioral problem in ques- 
tion is completely terminated. 

This model is especially relevant for program 
planners and educators using information dif- 



O 




fusion strategies because it sensitizes them to 
the notion that different change strategies are 
required depending on the stage of change 
people are in. For example, people in the pre- 
contemplation stage may need information to 
increase their knowledge of cardiovascular risk 
factors. People in the action phase, on the 
other hand, may need specific strategies that 
focus on changing behaviors.

Needs and Opportunities 



This section offers recommendations for trans- 
forming needs into opportunities regarding 
health promotion and disease prevention and 
control programs targeting American Indians 
and Alaska Natives. These recommendations 
are based on the existing epidemiological liter- 
ature, on evaluations of current health promo- 
tion and disease prevention programs, and on 
telephone interviews with people working to 
improve the health of native people. The rec- 
ommendations are divided into four phases: 
design and assessment, planning, implementa- 
tion, and evaluation. These recommendations 
are by no means exhaustive, but they do pro- 
vide a framework upon which to build effective 
health programs that change attitudes, increase 
knowledge, and adapt lifestyle behaviors rela- 
tive to heart health among native people. 

Design and Assessment Phase 

There is a paucity of data on the health status 
of American Indians and Alaska Natives. 

These data are necessary to develop, imple- 
ment, and assess effective CVD programs. 
Significant effort should be placed on improv- 
ing the representation of native people in 
national health surveys. More studies similar 
to the Strong Heart Study, which compares 
groups of American Indians, are desperately 
needed to determine the extent of variability in 
the health behaviors and disease patterns of 
different tribes. 

An American Indian and Alaska Native task 
force or advisory board should be established 



in the community prior to the development of 
any health programs. The advisory board may 
consist of representatives of Federal agencies, 
professional organizations and nonprofit advo- 
cacy groups, tribal leaders, medicine men and 
medicine women, and interested community 
members. A wide representation will add cred- 
ibility and visibility to the project. Members of 
the advisory board can provide information on 
cultural values and health beliefs and prac- 
tices. They also can identify key community 
leaders, local experts, and organizations that 
might be useful to the program. 

A needs assessment survey should be devel- 
oped to identify the educational gaps in exist- 
ing CVD programs targeting American Indians 
and Alaska Natives. Telephone or in-person 
interviews with community leaders, native 
health officials, and tribal elders, as well as 
focus groups, will provide a clearer picture of 
the community’s perceived needs. The multi- 
factorial nature of CVD and the diversity of 
the native population preclude the develop- 
ment of an all-encompassing program target- 
ing all American Indians and Alaska Natives 
and all cardiovascular risk factors. On the 
other hand, a more feasible program would 
focus on specific risk factors and target specif- 
ic segments of the population. Another option 
would be to create a health promotion program 
that emphasizes lifestyle changes and behav- 
ioral modifications in areas that crosscut all 
cardiovascular risk factors. The advantage of 
focusing on lifestyle change is that it acknowl- 




51 



45 



edges the fact that behavior is a complex pat- 
tern of interrelated practices that are socially 
conditioned and culturally embedded. These 
behaviors, such as smoking and consumption 
of high-fat foods, may act synergistically to 
produce poor health outcomes. A holistic 
health promotion approach that takes into 
account the social norms, cultural values, and 
environmental circumstances that affect behav- 
ior may be particularly appropriate to native 
people who are accustomed to holistic meth- 
ods of healing. 

Based on the epidemiological data presented in 
this background paper, the following cardio- 
vascular risk factors and target audiences are 
identified as possible priority interventions: 

♦ cigarette smoking in tribes living in the 
Midwestern United States and in Alaska; 

♦ cigarette smoking among youth living on 
reservations; 

♦ diabetes in all tribes, especially those in the 
Southwestern and Midwestern United 
States; 

♦ high blood pressure in tribes with a high 
prevalence of diabetes; 

♦ obesity and physical inactivity in all tribes, 
with emphasis on family interventions and 
childhood obesity prevention programs; and 

♦ comprehensive health promotion approach- 
es incorporating heart-healthy lifestyle 
changes. 

Planning Phase 

A network of organizations with access to the 
target audience can be one of the most effec- 
tive methods of reaching the greatest number 
of people. When developing a CVD interven- 
tion program, potential partners should be 
invited to serve on an information diffusion 
and outreach network that promotes heart 



health among American Indians and Alaska 
Natives. This communication infrastructure 
can be a channel to disseminate, monitor, and 
evaluate heart health information distributed to 
native groups and individuals. Federal agen- 
cies, professional associations, and nonprofit 
advocacy groups can serve as potential part- 
ners. Examples include: 

♦ Indian Health Service, 

♦ U.S. Department of Agriculture, 

♦ National Indian Health Board, 

♦ National Congress of American Indians, 

♦ Association of American Indian Physicians, 
and 

♦ American Indian Health Care Association. 

There is a dearth of CVD educational materi- 
als for American Indians and Alaska Natives. 
Many community health clinics and communi- 
ty-based programs rely on outdated, scientifi- 
cally inaccurate, culturally irrelevant materials. 
Educational materials that are accurate and 
have been pretested for cultural sensitivity and 
literacy level are desperately needed. 

♦ Focus groups should be used to develop 
message themes and concepts. 

♦ Contractors, producers, and artists from the 
native community should be used. 

♦ Educational materials should be generic 
enough to be culturally relevant to most 
American Indian tribes. Original layout and 
master copies of the material should be 
made easily available so that organizations 
can adapt them to suit specific target audi- 
ences. 

♦ Educational materials should be pretested in 
different sites, including health fairs, Indian 
Health Service clinics, powwows, and annu- 
al conferences of professional associations.

An effective media campaign should be used 
to launch a health education program and to 
increase its visibility. Information from focus 
groups can help determine message concepts 
and target audiences for dissemination. 
American Indian and Alaska Native contrac- 
tors with technical expertise in creating media 
suitable for the target audience should be used 
in program development and identification of 
media placement in native communities. In 
addition, media-related associations with inter- 
est in promoting issues of this population can 
be involved in publishing or broadcasting 
information about the program. Some of these 
associations include: 

♦ American Indian Library Association, 

♦ Native American Journalist Association, and 

♦ Native American Public Broadcasting 
Consortium. 

Implementation Phase 

To build and maintain interest in the health 
intervention, community members should par- 
ticipate actively in all aspects of the program, 
including the implementation phase. 

Traditional healers, community health repre- 
sentatives, nutrition aides, students pursuing 
allied health fields at American Indian col- 
leges, and other interested groups or individu- 
als can be recruited as either staff members or 
volunteers. School boards, health boards, and 
community youth programs can be channels 
for incorporating family activities and commu- 
nity events such as powwows and sporting 
events into the program. 

A series of professional education training pro- 
grams may be developed for interested health 
professionals and paraprofessionals. These 
programs should incorporate both Western and 
traditional medicine in the areas of cardiovas- 
cular health for American Indians and Alaska 
Natives. This “train-the-trainer” educational 



method is particularly effective in promoting 
health behavior among members of the target 
audience long after the intervention has ended. 
In addition, many native people view health 
professionals and paraprofessionals as role 
models in their communities. 

Annual conferences of native professional 
associations and other health-related associa- 
tions are another channel for disseminating 
educational information and recruiting poten- 
tial partners. Poster sessions and plenary ses- 
sions can help raise awareness about CVD and 
provide an occasion to present research train- 
ing opportunities to American Indians and 
Alaska Natives. Some annual conferences 
include: 

♦ National Congress of American Indians, 

♦ Association of American Indian Physicians, 

♦ American Indian Science and Engineering 
Organization, and 

♦ American Indian Health Care Association. 

Evaluation Phase 

A system should be devised to monitor infor- 
mation diffusion and education efforts. The 
tracking system should provide both quantita- 
tive and qualitative data on process, impact, 
and outcome measures. The advisory commit- 
tee and other members of the community 
should be actively involved in designing the 
evaluation methodology and identifying 
process, impact, and outcome measures.

Conclusion 



As a minority population in the United States, 
American Indians and Alaska Natives have not 
fully shared in the dramatic reductions in car- 
diovascular disease and other diseases experi- 
enced in recent years by the general popula- 
tion. CVD continues to take thousands of 
Native lives each year, destroying the strength 
and viability of native communities throughout 
the Nation. 

Fortunately, health promotion and disease pre- 
vention programs are now being implemented 
at the community level to counteract these 
destructive forces and address the cardiovascu- 
lar needs of American Indians and Alaska 
Natives. These interventions range from teach- 
ing young children to live healthy and active 
lifestyles to changing the health behaviors of 
people already affected by CVD or complica- 
tions from cardiovascular risk factors. How- 
ever, much more needs to be accomplished to 
reduce the disproportionate burden of disease 
among native people and to improve the health 
and well-being of this generation and genera- 
tions to come. 

According to a Sioux prophecy, the seventh 
generation since the colonization of American 
Indian land by European settlers marks the 
time that the Nation’s broken hoop will be 
mended and American Indians will once again 
live in peace, health, and harmony. The 
American Indians of today are the seventh 
generation that their ancestors prayed for 



(Katz, 1995). Therefore, it is appropriate and 
necessary that health promotion programs be 
created to mend the broken hoop of health and 
longevity that American Indians and Alaska 
Natives once enjoyed.

: NHLBI National Education Programs Offer Leadership and Information 



Since 1972, the NHLBI has taken steps to apply the latest research to the development of practical 
methods to promote successful health interventions. Through its national education programs and 
initiatives, the NHLBI plays a leadership role by educating health care professionals, patients, and 
the public about the prevention and treatment of heart, lung, and blood diseases and sleep disor- 
ders. The national programs develop and distribute patient and professional materials, including 
clinical practice guidelines, and sponsor special events such as the National High Blood Pressure 
Education Month (May) and the National Cholesterol Education Month (September), which pro- 
mote awareness of heart disease risk factors and encourage regular screening. 

Visit the NHLBI Web site at http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov for more information about the programs and 
initiatives listed below or to access publications in electronic format.
