FOREWORD 


he purpose of this book is twofold. First, to provide teachers with a bibliogra- 
_ phy of books by and about Montana’s Indians. And secondly, to encourage 
educators to use them. 

Historically, teachers in Montana have had a difficult time finding books that 
accurately depicted this state’s Native American population. At best, many of 
the books have portrayed sensationalized, stereotyped, and in some cases, wholly 
inaccurate pictures of Native Americans. In the following excerpt from George 
Catlin and the Old Frontier (1841) Catlin presents a perspective far different 
from that of most of the popular writers of his day. He states: 

I love a people who have made me welcome to the best they had ...who 
are honest without laws ... who worship God without a Bible, and I be¬ 
lieve God loves them also ... who are free from religious animosities ... 
who never raised a hand against me or stole my property where there 
was no law to punish either ... who never fought a battle with whitemen 
except on their own ground ... and oh! how I love a people who don't live 
for the love of money. (14) 

It has not been until recent times that book companies have produced books 
that one might comfortably use in the classroom with some degree of confidence 
in their accuracy. Further complicating the problem for teachers, book compa¬ 
nies haven’t found it profitable to focus their resources on a target population 
with a relatively small demand. Consequently, teachers were left with either 
little or no choice in securing texts, library books, or other educational materials 
for learning about American Indians. 

One of the most respected Native American educators, authors, and activists, 
Rupert Costo, former editor of the Indian Historian Press, many times alluded 
to the problem of selection of materials for the classroom. He indicated that 
most textbooks and instructional materials are designed to appeal to the widest 
possible market, and they are often presented from an ethnocentric viewpoint. 
Native Americans and other cultural groups are frequently stereotyped, dis¬ 
torted, or sometimes omitted. In Textbooks and the American Indian (1970), he 
says: “The attempt to transmit a single view results in the denial of the heri¬ 
tage, values, and views of culturally diverse groups in a heterogeneous society.” 

It is so important that individuals in our schools who are responsible for secur¬ 
ing materials about Native Americans be knowledgeable and sensitive as to 
avoid selecting materials that degrade a student’s heritage, are inaccurate or 
unfair, or perpetuate negative generalizations. By using such materials, the 
Indian and non-Indian students alike may remain uninformed, possibly becom¬ 
ing more biased and prejudiced. The importance of selecting proper materials 
cannot be understated, as Costo goes on to suggest in the following excerpt: 


Everyone has the right to their opinion, a person has the right to be 
wrong. But a textbook has no right to be wrong, or to evade, distort, 
falsify history, or to insult or malign a whole race of people. There is a 
















difference between a book used for general readership and one accepted 
for classroom use. In the first case, the individual has a choice, and this 
choice must be protected. The student has no choice. He is compelled to 
study from an approved text, and in this case we must insist on truth, 
accuracy and objectivity. (11) 

Students of Montana need to learn about the rich history of Montana’s Native 
population. They need to learn about their neighbors from eleven official Indian 
tribes who live in communities throughout the state and on the seven reserva¬ 
tions. This fact alone offers educators a wealth of information to share and 
exchange with their students. Not only is it important for schools to provide 
information and awareness regarding the Native American for students’ recre¬ 
ational reading, but it is also encouraged by legislation and public school direc¬ 
tives. Article X of the Montana Constitution guarantees “equality of educa¬ 
tional opportunity to each person in the state.” Further, it recognizes “the dis¬ 
tinct and unique heritage of the American Indians and is committed in its edu¬ 
cational goals to preserve their cultural integrity.” Subsequently, it was with 
this concept in mind that the 1973 Montana Legislature enacted the Indian 
Studies Law encouraging schools to prescribe to the intention of the law. 

In April 1997, Montana Governor Marc Racicot signed the American Indian 
Heritage Day Bill 117, which is “An act designating the fourth Friday in Sep¬ 
tember of each year as American Indian Heritage Day in the State of Mon¬ 
tana...” Therefore, “Commemorative exercises on certain days: All districts shall 
conduct appropriate exercises during the school day on the following commemo¬ 
rative days: (f) American Indian Heritage Day.” 

In an effort to help teachers with book selections by and about our region’s Na¬ 
tive American peoples, Dorothea Susag, classroom teacher in Simms High School, 
has developed an extensive listing of books which are intended to assist educa¬ 
tors who seek information and materials about Montana’s Native population. 
She has spent considerable time gathering and developing materials which are 
meant to encourage teachers to include Native American literature, history, 
and culture into their regular classroom activities. This book provides the reader 
with an extensive annotated bibliography and suggested resources for teaching 
about Montana’s Native Americans in primary through secondary grades. 

Ms. Susag does not intend the list to be an end-all in books about Indians of 
Montana, but perhaps only a beginning. Teachers are encouraged to add to the 
list, make comments, and share with others.

AT HOME WITHIN FAMILY 


Northern Cheyenne 

I come from a respectful family that’s in good health. 

I learned that goodness from the heart is good wealth. 

I come from where the fields are long and the hills are filled with trees. 
I come from where the air is cool and only blows with a cool breeze. 

I come from where my heart beats with the sound of a drum, 
and the earth and sky are connected because they are one. 

I come from where the mountains kiss the sky, 
and only in circles do eagles fly. 

I come from a way of life, 

where the circle begins and never ends.

INTRODUCTION 



merican Indian literatures, in print and in the movies, are enjoying 
more popularity today than ever before. Romantic images of noble 
individuals living in perfect harmony with a sacred and forgotten 
landscape attract many readers and viewers. Tragic images of lands and peoples 
suffering under exploitation and cultural genocide also draw the attention of 
conscientious people on both this continent and Europe. Furthermore, the so¬ 
cial, spiritual, and environmental values of surrounding Native American cul¬ 
tures particularly interest those who reject the idea of Euro-American cultural 
superiority. 


The responsibility for presenting meaningful and appropriate Native American 
literatures to students of all ages and races has become more important and yet 
increasingly difficult because so much of the published literature represents 
non-Indian cultural voices, having been written and promoted apart from any 
specific tribal or cultural context. Also, failing to represent the American In¬ 
dian experience honestly, much of the literature reinforces negative stereotypes, 
denigrates the cultural and personal pride of Indian peoples, and denies their 
humanity and integrity. 


Believing in the undeniable right of all children to locate their identities in the 
stories and experiences of those who have gone before, I undertook Native Ameri¬ 
can Literature - Montana and Northcentral Regional Publicationsbecnuse of my 
increasing frustration over trying to make regional and culturally specific lit¬ 
eratures available to my students. 


The project formally began in the Spring of 1992 when I left my English teach¬ 
ing position at Simms High School for one year, having received the Montana 
1992-93 Christa McAuliffe Fellowship for the proposal: "Personal Connections 
in Time and Place Through Native American Literature—The Development of a 
Study of Native American Literature for Montana Students from Kindergarten 
through Twelfth Grade." 


At the start, several educators suggested that a resource for using Native Ameri¬ 
can Literature would develop fairly easily since “there wasn’t much out there.” 
They were right. The lists in catalogs from major publishing companies and 
distributors featured limited selections of legitimate and culturally relevant texts. 
One catalog list under “Native American” included The Woman Warrior, by 
Maxine Hong Kingston, who is Chinese American. I also found that most teach¬ 
ers I surveyed were relying on popular non-Native authored storybooks and nov¬ 
els. But once I began visiting the seven Montana tribal communities, I found 
lifetimes of volumes of oral and written resources. 


On my first visit to Browning, Blackfeet Tribal Education Director, Harold Dusty 
Bull, handed me a printed bibliography twenty pages thick and said, “Tell me 
what’s in these books.” That conversation, and the commitment of Denise Ju¬ 
neau (Blackfeet/Hidatsa) to work with the elders and literature from her com¬ 
munity and to provide whatever assistance she could to make sure the project 









would succeed, were the beginning of the published McAuliffe Fellowship project 
which would ultimately feature annotated bibliographies of available Native- 
authored works as well as provide geographical, cultural, and historical contexts 
and educational approaches to the literature. 

In October 1998, the National Council of Teachers of English will release Roots 
and Branches: A Resource of Native American Literature Themes, Lessons, and 
Bibliographies, by Dorothea Susag, illustrated by Jack Real Bird (Crow), with a 
foreword by Joseph Bruchac (Abenaki). Because this book grew too large, the 
NCTE editor recommended we publish separately the Montana section and the 
majority of the primary-level materials. Native American Literature - Montana 
and Northcentral Regional Publications is that separate publication. A neces¬ 
sary complement to Roots and Branches, it is specifically tailored for teachers 
and librarians in Montana, providing them with access to those K-12 Native 
American literary arts resources that Montana teachers and Native American 
cultural leaders have worked so hard to collect. 

Native American Literature - Montana and Northcentral Regional Publications 
is designed to help K-12 language arts, social studies, and science teachers to 
integrate more authentic Native American literary arts resources into their cur- 
riculums so that both Native and non-Native K-12 students will: 

• better understand and value their own identities; 

• develop an appreciation for their own cultures and artistic expressions, 
especially within their communities and surrounding landscapes; and 

• further their understanding of cultures and peoples who differ from 
themselves. 

Although literatures may be taught chronologically to support a study of history, 
or literatures may be taught as representative of particular genres or as a means 
of acculturation, it is the thematic study which creates the opportunity for stu¬ 
dents to make “meaningful and useful” connections between the classroom and 
their personal worlds. When this connection occurs, teachers can more effec¬ 
tively use the literatures to explore other elements of language use, such as writ¬ 
ing, listening, speaking, viewing, grammar, diction, style, mechanics, and genre. 
This publication encourages the thematic approach by categorizing cited works 
according to the following themes: 

Remembering the Old Ways (Primary, Intermediate, Secondary) 

At Home Within Nature (Primary) 

At Home Within Family (Primary) 

At Home Within Circles (Intermediate, Secondary) 

Change and Growth (Intermediate) 

Between Two Worlds (Primary, Intermediate, Secondary) 

Lifeways and Stereotypes (Intermediate, Secondary) 

Cultural and Personal Loss and Survival (Secondary) 

Annotations of literary arts are included from seven Montana tribal communi¬ 
ties: Blackfeet, Crow, Flathead(Salish/Kootenai), Ft. Belknap (Assiniboine/Gros 
Ventre), Ft. Peck (Assiniboine/Sioux), Northern Cheyenne, Rocky Boy(Chippewa/ 
Cree), from Northwestern and Central regional publishers, including the Mon¬ 
tana Office of Public Instruction, regional journals, newspapers, and magazines. 
From across the state, tribal educators have expressed their willingness to share 

























stories and publications which are not regarded as sacred or ceremonial with 
teachers who will respect the local cultural traditions. 

Many tribal people have also expressed concern that those who use or tell the 
stories acknowledge and respect their cultural, historical, and geographical con¬ 
texts. Such concerns are not peculiar to Native American peoples. Not too long 
ago, for instance, I met a woman who was very interested in my last name; 
apparently she had known my husband’s family for years. “Is your husband as 
stingy and penny-pinching as his grandfather?” Well, I thought, how much do I 
dare share? I’d never seen this woman before. But I didn’t need to worry. Step¬ 
ping on the end of her own question, she shifted her shoulders and began to tell 
me the story of “Grandpa and the buttermilk.” 

Three days a week, every week of the year, Grandpa and Grandma would load 
their wagon with Grandma’s hand-churned butter, fresh cream, milk, and but¬ 
termilk, and drive the seventeen miles to town. Invariably, they would meet old 
friends and neighbors who would stop by the wagon to visit. On hot summer 
days, Grandpa would offer each a glass of buttermilk. “But,” she chuckled, “he 
always made sure to charge them the full price, once they were finished!” When 
I told an elder member of my husband’s family the story I had heard, she was 
noticeably disturbed. “Those people don’t understand,” she said. “They don’t 
know the way Grandpa had to live and how hard he worked! They don’t know 
the whole story! Grandpa and Grandma survived when thousands of bankrupt 
farmers on the dust-blown Montana plains packed up and moved east!” 

Like my elder family member, these tribal people have legitimate concerns about 
sharing their stories with people from other places, times, and cultures. They 
want their stories not merely told, but understood. Native people are not con¬ 
vinced that non-Natives can ever know "the whole story," much less communi¬ 
cate it without distortion to others. In an attempt to address this problem, both 
Native American Literature—Montana and Northcentral Regional Publications 
and Roots and Branches have been written with one goal paramount: to particu¬ 
larly respect the Native voices that honestly express their own historical and 
cultural heritages and to support each student’s discovery of his/her cultural 
ties to ancient and contemporary writers. 

In truth, those of us from outside the culture cannot teach Native American 
literatures. But we can affirm their right to be heard and read. Although this 
text is by no means the complete list of Native American literature and resources, 
I hope that for teachers in Montana and beyond who might see it, it is a begin¬ 
ning. I hope, too, that other books will be written from these and from other 
geographical areas, specifically respecting particular and unique tribal cultures.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 



lthough I am responsible for putting this work together, Native American 
Literature—Montana and Northcentral Regional Publications and Roots and 
Branches represent the voices of many. For the last six years, at the Univer¬ 
sity of Montana, with tribal peoples from across the state, and with numerous 
educators and authors, I have been privileged to study North American tribal 
histories and cultures, Native American literatures, and the writing of language 
arts curricula. 


I am greatly indebted to those whose vital contributions have made this publica¬ 
tion possible: the Department of Education and the Christa McAuliffe Fellow¬ 
ship Program which provided the initial funds for study ... the Montana Arts 
Council Special Projects Grant which provided funds for the final publication ... 
Authors and consultants—Dr. Murton McCluskey, Joseph Bruchac, and Denise 
Juneau, who all read and responded to a number of complete drafts, graciously 
answering my many phone calls; and Beverly Slapin, who provided expert at¬ 
tention and meticulous detail to the entire draft ...the Montana Advisory Coun¬ 
cil for Indian Education and the Northern Cheyenne Tribal Council, who pro¬ 
vided written letters of support. 

Tribal elders, leaders, and tribal college personnel encouraged me and entrusted 
me with materials they considered especially relevant for their children, as well 
as for children outside their communities—Minerva Allen, Tim Bernardis, Bob

and her husband, Lori and Hugh Maxwell, both educators, and my husband, 
Sylvan Susag, a career counselor in Poplar on the Fort Peck Reservation. For 
their encouragement and continuing support over the last six years, I am most 
grateful. 

To these and to others I may have failed to mention who have also shared in the 
vision, to those who have contributed their own voices and translations to my 
rethinking and rewriting, and to those who believe in the undeniable right of all 
people to tell their own stories and the right of all children to hear and read the 
stories of their heritage, I dedicate this work.

LIFEWAYS AND STEREOTYPES 






















AT HOME WITHIN NATURE 


Mission Canyon 

I see the water flowing into its big brother 
River in the swimming hole so they can 
Communicate, when the birds sing and 
Fly around them 

The canyon walls look like dinosaurs 
When you are far away from them 
Because long time ago the sea 
Overflowed so the dinosaurs 
Became fossils in the canyon walls 
So they’ll be there forever

Snake Butte 

Snake Butte is a long beautiful 
mountain. It has all of the Fort Belknap 
Reservation buffalo around it. I remember 
the first time I saw it, it looked like 
a giant buffalo jump. That part was very 
beautiful. All of those buffalo. As I was 
riding along, I saw the biggest buffalo 
of the herd. And we looked each other in 
the eye. 

Garrett Morin (Gros Ventre), 5th grade, Hays, MT 


The Missouri River 

I see the Missouri like it was flowing into the rainy clouds. 

As it starts to rain and hits the water down below 
it makes a beautiful song. 

When the bees fly 

the buzz adds more delight to the song. 

When the frogs croak 
it adds more love 

When the river flows 

it sounds like a bunch of rocks falling down the hill side. 

Then the sun comes up and the day begins.

uthor's Note: Each annotation in this section and the next is pref¬ 
aced with general grade level, genre, and thematic designations. In 
addition, the tribal affiliation of text and/or author(s) is included in 
the bibliographic citation. Since most Native authors regard themselves first as 
members of tribal nations and second as “Native American” or “Indian,” I have 
made references to specific tribal affiliations of individual storytellers and writ¬ 
ers whenever possible. However, accurate identification of nation names is prob¬ 
lematic because the French, Spanish, and English conquerors and agents of the 
federal government mistranslated and misnamed them. Today, many of those 
misnomers, such as Sioux, Gros Ventres, and Crow, remain “legal” and familiar. 


As I attempted to resolve these issues for the purposes of this resource, I relied 
on publishers’ and distributors’ designations, on references within the text them¬ 
selves, on whatever individual storytellers and writers called themselves, and 
on Native consultants. As a result, occasionally spelling varies. I have also 
avoided assigning what some scholars consider “culturally appropriate” nation 
names, especially when the texts or writers themselves suggest differences. Still, 
I realize that nation name errors probably exist, and I would appreciate any 
suggestions that would make future editions more accurate. 


I have used the terms “Native American” and “Indian” interchangeably for two 
reasons. Many people regard the misnomer “Indian” as derogatory—“Columbus’s 
mistake”— and prefer the term “Native American,” viewing it as an attempt to 
“set things right” and to demonstrate long-neglected respect. On the other hand, 
University of Montana Professor Debra Earling (Salish) maintains that Native 
people, having survived 500 years of genocide, alienation, and discrimination, 
have given dignity to the term “Indian.” 

Some of the annotations that follow are more developed than others, even at the 
risk of telling too much of the story out of context, because I believe teachers 
need to see the way the values and story lines exhibited in these materials might 
compare—and contrast—with those they currently use. Also, several of the se¬ 
lections represent primary resources for historical events. However, I would 
caution against using the descriptions of stories as included here without first 
obtaining the published materials and without establishing their place in com¬ 
munity, in a time, in a landscape, and for a purpose.

♦ Allen, Minerva (Assiniboine). Basal Bilingual Readers. Hays, MT: 
Hays/Lodge Pole Schools, 1988. Illustrated in black and white by Hank 

Chopwood, Frank Cuts the Rope, and Mike Brokie. 

Genre: Traditional and Contemporary Story 

Theme: Remembering the Old Ways (and other themes) 

Grade Level: Primary and Intermediate 

Allen welcomes both Native and non-Native teachers and students to use 
these little books. Most represent traditional stories told by elders, but some 
are based on historical events. Although they are basal readers for teaching the 
Assiniboine and Gros Ventre languages at the primary level, even secondary 
students can appreciate the themes, conflicts, and traditions which they por¬ 
tray. 

When a Native first-grade teacher on the Ft. Peck Reservation used these 
books, she read the story in Assiniboine and then explained to her Sioux stu¬ 
dents that this language represents the Nakota dialect of the language their 
people speak. The students enjoyed hearing and reading the stories themselves, 
and then they participated in discussion and drawing activities developed from 
the suggested themes. 

♦ -. “Bandit the Racoon.” (Assiniboine). 

Theme: Between Two Worlds 

This story may be used at all levels to teach about the problems individu¬ 
als experience when they live in one culture and misunderstand the rules of the 
alien culture. The story also may be used to teach about the way individuals are 
judged by their appearance. “Bandit looked like a bandit alright, standing be¬ 
hind the bars. But he was only a racoon.” Primary children on the Ft. Peck 
Reservation could understand the problems for racoon when they imagined how 
they would feel if they went to dance in a classical ballet dressed as Indian 
dancers. They also wrote different endings to the story, endings which gave 
Racoon more power. Like all of Allen’s Bilingual Readers, the text is written in 
both Assiniboine and English. Still, children who don’t know the Assiniboine 
language can appreciate the importance of this language which the text affirms. 

♦ -. “Chinook Winds.” (Assiniboine). 

Theme: Remembering the Old Ways, At Home Within Nature 

This is a story about the origin of warm winter winds and the way the 
elements of earth respond to the needs of human beings, especially when hu¬ 
mans respect and revere their power. When the “Chinook” winds blow, the 
temperatures may change within a few hours, from -10 degrees to 40 degrees 
above zero. 


♦ -. “Inktomi Goes Visiting.” (Assiniboine). 

Theme: Remembering the Old Ways, At Home Within Nature 

Inktomi—Iktomi in the Nakota dialect—the Indians’ brother is also a 
brother to all the animals and birds. Because he is wise and cautious, he ob¬ 
serves the behavior of his little brothers, the snakes, and does not eat the meat 
they have poisoned.

Bibliography 















Native students who have heard Iktomi stories from parents and grand¬ 
parents especially appreciate hearing these stories read and told in school, and 
they want to tell other stories they know. 

♦ -. “Pretty Flower.” (Assiniboine). 

Theme: Remembering the Old Ways, At Home Within Nature 

This is a story about the origin of the sunflower and the intimate and 
interdependent relationship between human beings and things of the earth. 
After reading the story, a primary teacher on the Ft. Peck reservation drew a 
picture of a sunflower on the board. In the petals of the flower, students wrote 
about particular aspects of the story which they remembered, and then they 
placed the name of the main character in the center of the flower. In leaves 
drawn on the stem, the students filled in the setting for the story. 

♦ -. “The Fat Pig.” (Gros Ventre). 

Theme: At Home Within Family 

This story teaches the consequences of selfishness. 

♦ -. “School Days at Big Warm.” (Assiniboine). 

Theme: Between Two Worlds 

“School Days” presents a positive experience in the acculturation of Indian 
children. It takes place in the mid-1900s when children traveled by horse, cars 
and wagons to a one-room day school with no electricity. The children bring 
their own lunches, play games and put on a play for Christmas. “It was a happy 
school.” 

♦ -. “Selling Wood in Lodgepole.” (Assiniboine). 

Theme: At Home Within Family, Between Two Worlds 

In a more contemporary story, a young boy, whose family sells wood for a 
living, demonstrates his responsibility to help his family without being told. 
Although the family lives in the country outside a town, they still participate in 
the local market economy. 

♦ -. “The Little Rat & The Big Rat.” (Gros Ventre). 

Theme: At Home Within Family 

This story teaches the negative consequences of refusing to help a relative 
or friend in need. 

♦ -. “The Rat and the Cat.” (Gros Ventre). 

Theme: At Home Within Family 

A little rat frightens the bigger rats when he plays a trick on them. But 
the little rat also learns what it feels like to be chased and frightened himself. 
He later learns, “I will not play that trick on the rats!" 

♦ -. “Vanishing Braves.” (Assiniboine). 

Theme: At Home Within Nature 

Lost braves are found when a grandmother shows a brave how to use medi¬ 
cine to turn trees into missing braves. The story teaches the importance of spiri¬ 
tual power, and the wisdom of elders and their concern for their community.

Illustrated by Frank Cuts The Rope and John D. Doney, this collection 
includes 35 illustrated stories told by Jenny Gray, Hank Chopwood, Lucille 
Chopwood, Wallace Chopwood, Vemie Bell, Estelle Blackbird, George Shields, 
Dora Helgeson, Theresa Lamebull, and Andrew Lamebull. 

Useful at all levels, these stories, which may be read or told, communicate 
traditional values: the importance of generosity, of personal sacrifice, of ingenu¬ 
ity and courage, of natural beauty, and of trusting in the power of medicine. In 
some stories, characters like Iktomi play jokes on others, but the stories also 
warn listeners to watch out for those who might deceive or hurt them. Several 
stories recreate actual events in the life of the Assiniboine and Gros Ventre 
tribes.

Grade Level: Primary, Intermediate and Secondary 
Illustrated by Harvey King and George Shields Jr., and produced by the 
Curriculum Development Project of the Fort Belknap Education Department, 
these stories represent personal accounts of Assiniboine elders. In the introduc¬ 
tion, Preston L. Stiffarm tells that the Assiniboine call themselves Nakota, which 
means “The Generous Ones” in English, and he suggests these stories reflect 
the ways and beliefs “the Creator had given” this “proud and courageous people.” 

The collection of 33 stories is organized as follows: sacred stories, "the 
nucleus of their way of life”; legends, which “serve to explain unnatural phe¬ 
nomenon”; historical stories, which “give them a sense of being”; and humorous 
stories about Ik-Tomi, which give them “hope and laughter in a world filled with 
many trials and tribulations.” In the “Assiniboine Creation Story,” Ik-Tomi “made 
everything that we now see,” and he made seven men and seven women. Want¬ 
ing to locate a better place for them to live, he finds oyster shells that he and the

people float on. A fisher is able to dive down to the bottom of the lake and bring 
back clumps of mud. Ik-Tomi uses this to make the land “we are now on.” Then 
he creates a lake—Lake Winnepeg, which to the Assiniboine represents the 
center of the world. 

The Assiniboine were known to the eastern tribes as Cut Throats because 
“they delighted themselves in the throat-cutting of their enemies when in battle.” 
Later this group split so the people known as Assiniboine went to the Provinces 
of Canada and the United States. The other party was called Cut Throat (Santee 
Sioux). The name Assiniboine came from their practice of boiling water with 
hot stones. If teachers have questions about appropriate grade levels and ways 
to use these stories, they may contact Minerva Allen in Hays.

Genre: Historical Narrative 

Theme: Cultural and Personal Loss and Survival, 

Lifeways and Stereotypes 

Grade Level: Intermediate and Secondary 

With a chapter on “The Ancient Blackfeet” before 1830, Bennet begins his 
historical narrative of the Blackfeet, culminating in the tragic story of the Baker 
Massacre in the winter of 1870. Demoralized and frozen from days of travel 
without fires, a troop of young military men from Ft. Shaw mistook the “peace¬ 
ful” Heavy Runner and his band—near the Two Medicine River—for the band of 
Owl Child, the Blackfeet “renegade.” Heavy Runner and nearly all of his band of 
Blackfeet women, children, and a few warriors were massacred. 

Bennet purposes to tell the story from the point of a traditional Blackfeet, 
incorporating Napi or Old-Man stories and using the formal and metaphorical 
rhetoric which readers may assume “sounds Indian.” “And if the raid were fa¬ 
vored and the raiders fortunate, many coups would be counted, many horses 
captured, and new voices heard in the councils” (7). Bennet has used available 
letters and diaries of military men involved in the massacre, suggesting that the 
personal need for glory superseded careful judgement, finally concluding that 
the massacre resulted more from a combination of unfortunate circumstances 
than from a combined and purposeful effort to kill innocent people. 

Other sources argue that Baker knew he was attacking the wrong camp. 
James Welch used this book as a resource for his novel Fools Crow, and students 
may read Bennet’s book in conjunction with their study of Fools Crow. Students 
should also examine Bennet’s bias to see where the story Bennet wishes to tell 
might overshadow the historical.

In the introduction, Harry Bull Shows tells Hap Gilliland that he has de¬ 
cided to tell these stories “so our children will have them.” Gilliland has made 
every effort to keep the language as Harry Bull Shows used it, a free translation 
from the beautiful Crow. Although the English may not sound appropriate, 
Gilliland believes it is most appropriate since it is closer to the Crow language. 

In this collection of stories, Chief Bald Eagle, with other birds helping him, saves 
the thunderbirds from the two-headed monster. Although the stories are excit¬ 
ing and fun to read, they also demonstrate the importance of personal commit¬ 
ment to the welfare of the group.

Cheyenne as well as English. The story, “Crossing on the Ice,” told by Mrs. 
Albert Hoffman, tells about a time when the Cheyennes lived “on the other side” 
and how they crossed a “big river” of thick ice. “Sweet Medicine,” also told by 
Mrs. Hoffman, foretells the coming of the person who “will destroy the things 
you used to depend on...who will take over all the land.” “The Seven Stars,” told 
by Dorra Torres, tells about the “seven sisters” in the Big Dipper. Other stories 
teach the importance of staying one step ahead of the enemy and surviving

From Chief Joseph’s own words as he traveled to Washington, D.C. in 1879, 
this story poses dramatic contrast to the Chief Joseph stories by Thomasma and 
by Troll publications, which carry the Vanishing Indian and Noble Savage ste¬ 
reotypes. In Joseph’s translated words, he says, “I will tell you all about our 
people, and then you can judge whether an Indian is a man or not.” Joseph tells 
the story of his encounters with the government and the military before and 
after his flight and final surrender.

Ways of Native American peoples. Most of the stories in this collection are Nez

The explorer-geographer, David Thompson, first recorded “The Beginning 
of the Cree World” before the Crees’ first contact with Christian missionaries. 

The Creator is displeased with Wisakedjak who has “let the creatures do what¬ 
ever they wished to do.” So Creator causes a flood to destroy everything except 
“one Otter, one Beaver, and one Muskrat.” When neither Otter nor Beaver can 
recover some old earth below the water, Wisakedjak sends Muskrat. From the 
earth on his paws, Wisakedjak re-creates an island. The story concludes with a 
question about who was responsible for the rest of Creation, Wisakedjak or the 
Creator. Still, Creator takes all Wisakedjak’s power, only leaving him “the power 
to flatter and to deceive.” “The Beginning of the Cree World” teaches the conse¬ 
quence of irresponsible behavior—the Salish in particular, or humanity in gen¬ 
eral, may lose forever the things they value the most. 

In the story “Creation of the Red and White Races,” Old Man Coyote grows 
lonely after Old-Man-in-the-Sky has created the world, and only Chief Beaver, 

Chief Otter, Chief Bear, and Chief Buffalo exist to keep him company. So Old- 
Man-in-the-Sky tells him to find red earth and bring it back. While Old Man 
Coyote sleeps, Mountain Sheep pour out the red soil and replace half of it with 
white soil. After shaping two men and two women in the darkness, Old Man 
Coyote realizes he has two different colors of people. Knowing he “can’t keep 
these two colors together, Old Man Coyote places the white ones by the “big salt 
hole,” and he takes the red ones to his own land where he can “visit with them.” 

“Creation of Three Races of People” was recorded from Chief Walking Buf¬ 
falo in 1954. It tells how the animals took earth and shaped “living souls.” But 
the first time they turn out “sickly looking”; the next time they bake in the sun 
too long and bum to a black color. On the third try they are satisfied—the man 
had “healthy-looking skin., .copper brown.” Each of the different races go to live 
in separate parts of the world. This story explains the difference in races, but it 
also communicates the intimate relationship between human beings and the 
earth and the animals.

The history and culture of the Blackfeet people are reflected in the ten 
short warrior stories which demonstrate the powerful influence of visionary and 
magical experiences the Blackfeet people have accepted as real. They are ex¬ 
amples of the kind of stories told long ago that recount many brave deeds of 
Miah-wa, Mik-ka-pi, Eagle Head, First Rider, Iron Pipe, and White Quiver who 
were assisted by their “secret helpers.” 

Three of the stories are short vignettes about teaching bravery to young 
boys constructing a sweat lodge and feasting after a buffalo hunt. They recount 
a piece of Blackfeet histoxy from a time “not long ago.” According to the Salish/ 
Kootenai Bibliography, “this also includes a story of a Flathead or Kalispel raid¬ 
ing party which left some stolen Gros Ventre horses with the Blackfeet herd 
and so started hostilities between the Gros Ventre and Blackfeet—1861.”

Born in Fort Macleod in 1911, Walter A. Denny came to the Bear Paw 
Mountains in 1921. Having learned these legends from “his Old People,” Walter 
Denny is regarded as a great storyteller by the Rocky Boy people. The book 
begins with an explanation of the Bird People who were changed into “the kind 
of creatures we know as birds today” because some had begun to brag about 
their superiority. Consequently, “a powerful spirit was sent to change them.” 
The text of each story includes names written in the Cree language using both 
Cree and English syllabaries. Each story closes with a lesson. For example: “So 
don’t think that no one sees us, no matter where we are. There is someone 
watching us from somewhere” and “So it is not right or nice to make fun of

This collection of 23 as-told-to stories, published for the first time, was 
made possible in part by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humani¬ 
ties. The introduction provides background information about Denny, the sto¬ 
ryteller. It also briefly explains the Chippewa-Cree storytelling tradition, as 
well as the individual styles of the storytellers, which Denny has tried to respect 
within the limitations of printed text. Beginning with a more distant point of 
view, the storyteller moves into and is present as the story progresses. The first 
story provides a brief history of the Rocky Boy Chippewa and the Little Bear 
Cree who were finally granted reservation status by Woodrow Wilson in 1916 
after roaming Montana, Canada, North Dakota, Idaho, and Wyoming. 

“Moons” is one story which may be used at all grade levels. In his introduc¬ 
tion, Denny says, “There are many stories about moons, or months of the year. 
Other Tribes also have stories about the twelve moons. But amongst my people, 
the Chippewa-Cree, there are names of moons and these are what they are sup¬ 
posed to do”(20). Many of the stories conclude with lessons: people should re¬ 
spect the beliefs of others; young women should not refuse to respect the wishes 
of fathers and brothers; the Chippewa-Cree tradition is important because it 
conveys the meaning of life; it is not good to be a gossip; it is important to watch 
everything closely; truthful actions, generosity, proven courage and kindness 
are respected qualities in leaders; it is healthy for all people to bathe every day; 
children should be brought up to be proud; and young people should grow up to 
be useful not lazy. 

Several stories tell about the origin of natural phenomena such as the size 
of ants, “Why Earth Worm Has No Eyes,” “Why Snake Has A Forked Tongue,” 
and one story tells about the “Spirits of the Winds of the Four Directions.” To¬ 
day, these natural phenomena serve to remind children of the lessons revealed 
in the stories. This book may be found in the Indian Resources Center Library, 
Great Falls.

In the first story, “How We Got the Great War Dance,” Red Wolf learns the 
dance from watching prairie chickens. In the second story, after years of sepa¬ 
ration, a “Lost Boy” returns to his camp because his parents followed the advice 
of a young man. In “Crow Courtship,” Sun Eagle wishes to marry beautiful 
Dawn Star. Although she gives him no encouragement, he persists and contin¬ 
ues to bring her presents. One day Sioux warriors capture Dawn Star, but she 
risks her life to escape and return to Sun Eagle. The fourth story, “Redman’s 
Grandfather,” begins with the creation of the earth. Of all the animals, the 
grizzly is master. After Great Spirit’s daughter marries a grizzly son, she bears 
children who were the first Indians. These stories reflect the values of close 
observation, fortitude, commitment to a purpose, and interdependence between 
humans and animals.

During the winters when Louie was little, his grandmother would tell him 
these humorous stories about the oldtimers (animals) and “Coyote and his brave 
and silly deeds,” and about the ways “Coyote got in a lot of trouble, but Fox 
always got him out of it.” When Coyote misbehaves, he is often aided by his 
friend, Fox, who is quick to point out Coyote’s mistakes. These tales teach the 
value of following directions, being yourself, and showing respect for wildlife. 
There are also tales of how Coyote prepared the animal world for the coming of 
people and how he tricked and changed animals like the owl and the mosquito. 
The stories communicate the importance of being satisfied with who we are, 
what we have, and what we can do, but they also tell about the origins of animal 
characteristics, about natural landmarks, and about the Kootenais’ conflict with 
the Blackfeet.

Jack Gladstone is Blackfeet. Writing his own ballads, Gladstone sings, 
plays the guitar and drum, and performs throughout the country. In “The 
Hawkstone Report” Jack Gladstone describes his latest album, Noble Heart. 
“The themes of this album are self-sacrifice, love of sport and homeland, and the 
bond of friendship, and the songs reaffirm a sense of awe, wonder and playful¬ 
ness. I employ a lot of metaphor, so interpretation can occur at whatever level 
the listener is comfortable with. Thus the songs on Noble Heart appeal to both 
children and adults.” Gladstone is a storyteller; he writes original songs, songs 
based on historical events and persons, and songs based on traditional Native 
stories.

On July 27, 1937, at Hays, Montana, The Boy told three stories which 
Thomas Main translated into English: “How Horses Came to the Ha’A’Ninin,” 
“Red Bird’s Death,” and “Chief Mountain’s Medicine.” In the first story, a boy 
must travel to the east where he will find the Red Otter skin for his Red Otter 
Medicine Bundle. Warned of the dangers, he still continues his journey. When¬ 
ever he fails to follow the advice from those he meets, he suffers the conse¬ 
quences. Along the way, he takes pity on a little garter snake and is helped by 
a Water Monster and a Bald Eagle. Finally he meets an old man who gives him 
a Red Otter skin for his Medicine Bundle and then promises to give him horses 
if he will carefully follow the old man’s advice. Because the boy has been obedi¬ 
ent, a “whole herd of horses” follows him to his camp where he gives them away 
to any person carrying a rope. 

While the story is entertaining, it also communicates several important 
valued behaviors: to respect the words and advice from elders, to be generous, 
and to treat all people with kindness.

During her lifetime, Mary Ground, whose Indian name was Grass Woman, 
experienced extreme changes in the life of Blackfeet Indians, from the travois 
and teepee days to the time when the reservation was a fenced compound pa¬ 
trolled by U.S. military. Mary Ground told these stories to her granddaughter, 
Cynthia Kipp, during the winter of 1977-78, and the Blackfeet Heritage Pro¬ 
gram Culture Committee reviewed them all. The fourteen stories in this vol¬ 
ume are a blend of customs, folklore, and real-life events in the life of the Pikuni 
people. Many, including marriage customs and childbirth rituals, reflect the 
culture from a woman’s point of view. Some of the stories tell of magical events 
that result in a lesson being taught, while others tell the true-life stories of men, 
women, and children who suffer harsh and sometimes violent consequences when 
they neglect, betray, or show disrespect for their relatives and friends. 

The most appropriate story for the Intermediate Level is “Calf Coat,” which 
communicates the interdependent relationship between human beings and ani¬ 
mals. When a young warrior is shot in the leg, and his comrades can carry him 
no longer, they stop to fix him a teepee where he might rest and heal his wound. 
Before leaving, they provide him with warm robes and dried meat. After a time, 
Coyote and Bear come to Calf Coat’s teepee and help him. After he recovers and 
he returns to his people, Calf Coat’s father—in gratitude—offers to feed Coyote 
and Bear, the “friends who brought [Calf Coat] home.”

Theme: Remembering the Old Ways, At Home Within Nature 

Grade Level: Primary, Intermediate and Secondary 
In Hatheway’s introduction, she defines Old Man Coyote Isaka Wata, “The 
Wise One, sometimes also called Old Coyote, as the father of all—The Creator 
and Supreme Being.... The story of Old Man Coyote’s creation of earth and man 
is very similar to our Bible story of creation.” In the “Creation of Earth and 
Man” story, Old Man Coyote sends ducks down below the earth’s covering of 
water. From one speck of mud grow trees, flowers, and then Old Man Coyote 
makes Fox to keep him company. But Fox is not satisfied to eat plants, so Old 
Man Coyote makes birds so the Fox won’t be always chasing the ducks. 

The story teaches the value that all creatures should remain “busy as well 
as healthy.” Teaching that all creation exists in an interdependent relation¬ 
ship, Old Man Coyote shows the creatures how to live to support themselves 
and how to live with each other. As he leaves his creation, he says, “Remember 
your bodies are of the earth; it came from the water, so you will use much water 
to live. Keep your bodies clean with the water, drink much water, use water to 
cook your food. Remember this and you will always be healthy and happy.” It is 
a lesson from the Old Ways which still applies today.

In “The Money God,” Mr. Channubii responds to a white reporter who ad¬

Intended as a supplemental reading program to help children improve read¬ 
ing comprehension and enhance verbal and written communication, this series 
also intends to develop and reinforce students’ positive self-image and pride. 
All of the story content has been researched, written and illustrated by Ameri¬ 
can Indians. The National Institute of Education, participating tribes, and the 
Pacific Northwest Indian Program of the Northwest Regional Educational Labo¬ 
ratory, over 250 “reservation-based planners, writers and artists” cooperated to 
produce this series which was tested for over five years. It has been used in the 
following programs: Language Arts, Indian Language and Culture, Special Edu¬ 
cation, Multi-cultural Awareness, Gifted and Talented, Head Start, Adult Basic 
Education, and Libraries. 

According to The Northwest Report, Northwest Regional Educational Labo¬ 
ratory: 

The pages are alive with the animals and birds that shared the Indian’s 
domain—coyotes and buffalo, eagles and ravens, bears, whales, and wild 
horses. Told with grace, wit and wisdom, the stories have been handed 
down over many generations from a time when storytelling was the ve¬ 
hicle for transmitting culture, for teaching values and survival skills, and 
for explaining natural phenomena. 

Although each of the four teacher’s manuals suggest activities to accom¬ 
pany the stories, almost sixty pages in the “Levels I, II, and III Teacher’s Manual” 
explain and illustrate the following teaching activities: Dramatization, Talking 
About, Retelling the Story, Writing Down, In Other Words (Making Books), and 
Word Study. “Level IV Teacher’s Manual” provides historical information re¬ 
garding the participating reservation communities, including Flathead, 
Blackfeet, Fort Belknap, Fort Peck, and Northern Cheyenne. “Teacher Guided 
Activities” accompany each story for this level. “Level V Teacher’s Manual” pro¬ 
vides vocabulary studies and science and social studies activities. The series 
also includes a parent/teacher guide. Elementary as well as secondary schools 
will find this an invaluable resource for the teaching of Native American litera¬ 
tures. The series includes 99 student booklets, 4 teacher’s manuals, 1 book, and

The storytellers in this collection are Sophie Adams, Eneas Pierre, and 
Agnes Vanderburg. One story tells how the animal people took away the 
mosquitos’ power. “From now on, you aren’t going to have any killing power. 
When Indians come to this world, you won’t be able to kill any of them. You will 
only be bothersome! And that is where all the mosquitos at Little Falls on the 
Spokane Reservation came from and why there are so many there today.” In 
some of these stories, the selfish or greedy monster—or individual—is killed, 
especially when his/her behavior jeopardizes the life of a relative.

Tales is a collection of coyote stories as told by Agnes Vanderburg, Jerome 
Lumpry, Ignace Pierre and Adele Adams. In the introduction, Law tells how 
“Coyote was sent to earth by God to protect the animal people. Coyote was 
forever getting into trouble and often got killed by monsters and other evil be¬ 
ings. Then Fox, his brother, would bring him back to life by jumping over him.... 
When Coyote had taught the animal people all he knew, he left the earth, going 
to where the Sun rises. His wife, Mole, went to where the Sun sets. People say 
Coyote will return at the end of the world.... Today, when one person mocks 
another, they call him Sin-Cha-lay, which means Coyote in the Salish language.” 

The stories in this collection include “Coyote and Rock,” where Coyote is 
saved by two old women; “How Skunk Lost His Killing Power,” where Coyote 
restricts the Skunk’s power because he had abused it; “Mole Leaves Coyote,” 
where Coyote is left alone because of his unwillingness to share his food with his 
family; “The Swallowing Monster,” which tells the story of why the “ant, the bed 
bug, and the wood tick look as they do today;” “The Race,” where Coyote thinks 
to win the race but drowns because he failed to heed the warning of an old

This book represents a collaboration between a student from Carroll Col¬ 
lege, Lenore McKelvey Puhek, and her teacher in Browning, Long Standing 
Bear Chief, at the Blackfeet Tribal College. The chapter headings represent the 
questions Puhek asked Bear Chief, and his responses reveal his concern for 
dispelling many misconceptions about Indian people. 

According to the author, this book represents the “values [he wants his] 
children to know, understand and respect.” He also admits what is written “has 
a sacred origin,” so readers should use this book with particular respect for that 
value. In the first chapter, Bear Chief explains the origins of his people’s names: 
Pikuni, Blackfoot, Blackfeet (assigned by the Federal Government in 1935 since 
it indicates the plural), Blood. He also explains the enemy origins of other tribal 
names: Cheyenne, Sioux, Cree, and Navajo. Following chapters include discus¬ 
sions about many aspects of the lives of contemporary Indian people from the 
author’s point of view, especially the Pikunis living on the Blackfeet Reserva¬ 
tion.

Grade Level: Intermediate 

After his Cheyenne father is killed in the battle of the Little Greasy Grass 
(The Little Big Horn), Shanni experiences a vision where he is called not to be a 
mighty warrior; instead he is called to be The Keeper of Fire—the guardian of a 
mighty power for his people. Under the direction of Old Badger, the medicine 
man, Shanni studies the Cheyenne traditions so he might bring honor to his 
father’s name. However, he is separated from his tribe when white soldiers 
attack a Cheyenne hunting party and only Shanni survives. On his journey to 
rejoin his Cheyenne people, he meets a friendly family of homesteaders who 
treat his wounds, feed and house him, and teach him some of their language. 
Shanni helps them fight a wild prairie fire. When he hears the prairie fire 
speaking to him in a “voice pulling him deeper into the jagged flames,” he is led 
to rescue their child from the midst of those flames. Shanni has learned he has 
the power to create and destroy fire. 

Although the author is non-Indian, this short novel lacks the romanticism 
and simplistically polarized view of Indian-white relations which dominates much 
contemporary literature about Indian peoples. Instead, Keeper of Fire portrays 
both Indians and whites in a realistic coming-of-age story. Teachers may use 
this in combination with more romanticized historical works about Plains Indi¬ 
ans.

When a boy befriends and protects a white buffalo calf, the buffalo bull 
grows to return, year after year, “bringing comrades [more buffalo] so...the Crows 
will never be hungry.” At the beginning of this book, Rosalie BearCrane, Crow, 
says: “This story is a vivid portrayal of the adventures of a young Indian boy 
during the era when Plains Indians relied on the buffalo to survive. It is a 
beautifully written characterization of the boy, interspersed with mystery, cul¬ 
ture, tradition, and history, which can stir the emotions of young readers and 
would spark the imagination, even without the superb illustrations. A true 
picture of the life of our people.” The story teaches that rewards come to those 
who demonstrate respect and compassion for others. In this story, the reward 
comes to all the Crow people because of Chii-la-pe’s respect for the white buffalo 
calf.

Although the specific tribal affiliation for each poet is not mentioned, the 
poems do represent a variety of backgrounds. This is contemporary poetry which 
connects with the Old Ways while it also reflects the issues which so many young 
Indians experience today. The following lines are from a poem by Don Watson 
regarding the importance of the Old Ways: Like “a drink of water held within/ 
the cupped hand...that precious liquid slipping away/becomes a matter/of life/ 
and death.” The speaker warns of a time “when the old ways will be needed by 
all people...” All of these short poems are written primarily by Plains Indian 
poets, and they sing of “The Old Ways” of Buffalo days and “folded” teepees, they 
sing of a “Summer Afternoon” and Grandmother’s “Winding Fingers,” and they 
tell their stories of culture conflict and survival.

Grade Level: Primary and Intermediate 

Six stories from various tribes comprise this collection. The Blackfeet story, 
“Napii and the Bullberries,” may be compared with Goble’s book Iktomi and the 
Berries, where the Trickster/Transformer is tricked by the reflections of berries 
in the water. The story teaches a lesson about the folly of pursuing illusions as 
though they are reality. 

In the Crow story, “Chipmunk and the Chick-A-Dees,” while Chipmunk is 
out gathering pine cones for winter, he hears Chick-a-dees playing hide-and- 
seek. Chick-a-dees stop to help him fill his hole, but when they finish, all the 
older Chick-a-dees have left the young ones behind. Because the Chick-a-dees 
help him, Chipmunk offers to share his nuts with them throughout the winter. 
And that is the story of how the Chick-a-dees became “snow birds.” Many les¬ 
sons are present in this story, but it certainly demonstrates the advantages of 
cooperation between individuals who are different. When they behave like rela¬ 
tives, they are At Home Within Family. 

In the “Blackbird and the Buffalo” Arapahoe story, blackbird marries a 
buffalo cow. After a time, she returns to her people and takes their only son 
with her. The blackbird goes to the buffalo people to ask for his son, but is told 
he must prove himself first. Although this story involves two very different 
animals, it communicates the problems which occur when individuals from two 
different worlds marry. However, the story also demonstrates that strength and 
wisdom will be respected and rewarded, even by an enemy. 

“The Girl and the Horses” may be compared with Goble’s story The Girl 
Who Loved Horses. When a girl’s parents forbid her to marry a certain warrior, 
she becomes separated from her people and joins a herd of horses. The story 
ends with an explanation of the Native belief that humans can change forms. 
“In this case the warrior changed into the stallion. In another version of the 
story the girl changed into a horse, too.” The story may also be used to illustrate 
ways humans, plants, and animals still change from one form or behavior to 
another.

Their Names” was recorded by Nez Perce Headstart Teachers, and it tells how 
the “Great Indian Maker, who ruled over the world, called on the wise Coyote” 
to give animals and birds their names. In this story he names Skunk, Deer, 
Bluebird, Bear, and Raccoon.

Gathered by Reese and Indian workers of the South Dakota Writers’ Project, 
this collection represents the traditional Sioux stories, as told in their own lan¬ 
guage. The Rosebud Sioux Tribal Council read the material and endorsed the 
book, and the University of South Dakota, and the Dakota Department of Public 
Instruction were also instrumental in its publication. Although elders and pu¬ 
pils in rural elementary schools suggested the pictures, Oscar Howe, Indian 
artist of the South Dakota Art Project, completed the drawings. 

The collection is organized into five sections: “The Mighty Sioux,” which 
includes the land, life, the life of boys and girls, and the traditions of songs and 
stories; “Traditional Lore,” which includes creation stories and stories providing 
answers to questions of natures; “Campfire Tales,” with several stories about 
Iktomi; “Legends of Places,” such as “The Black Hills” and “Standing Rock”; and 
“Hunting and Battle Stories,” which concludes with the story “Sitting Bull’s 
Dancing Horse.” Many stories in Legends of the Mighty Sioux are two to three 
pages, and an illustration accompanies each one. Because this collection has 
the support of the tribal and educational communities in South Dakota, it should 
be considered a reliable and usable resource for teaching Sioux legends from 
Primary through Intermediate levels.

All Blackfeet People knew of Napi, from the serious side of his creation to 
the foolish and spiteful deeds he performed. He could talk with all living things, 
and he teased and pulled pranks many times on himself and others. His actions 
began a cycle of existence. Although each family had its own interpretation of 
the various Napi stories, each story has a common moral. Through these sto¬ 
ries, it is hoped that Blackfeet children and others will begin to obtain an under¬ 
standing of the Blackfeet people. Full page black and white illustrations by

the day of the stampede, his brother falls in front of the running buffalo herd, 
but Little Blaze runs to pull him to safety. As a reward, his father gives him his

Alice Durland Ryniker taught art at Rocky Mountain College, Billings, for 
twenty-three years, and she and her husband have lived near the Crow Reser¬ 
vation. Set on the Crow Reservation at the time of Chief Plenty Coups, this is a 
story about a boy, Charley Little Otter, who longs to ride his uncle’s pinto mare. 
Ignoring the warnings of Plenty Coups, Charley mounts the mare and rides into 
the mountains without permission. There he is bucked off the horse when a 
rattlesnake scares her, and Charley is left alone on the sacred mountain. In a 
vision, he sees the Little People and receives an eagle feather for his bravery. 

Through this experience, Charley Little Otter learns that “One must work 
to become wise. A foolish person [who does not think carefully before he acts] is 
not honored for long.” Ryniker demonstrates a sensitivity for the day-to-day 
cultural traditions of the Crow as well as for their hardships.

Glossy color photos by Layout and Design Editor Celeste River and others ac¬

The journal also includes two book reviews, an article about “Hollywood’s 
Rediscovery of American Indians,” and a list of summer “Celebrations in Indian 
Country” from across the nation. This journal may be used as a classroom re¬

This is the third issue of Spirit Whispers. This and other issues present 
the art, poetry, prose, and reading, typing, designing, editing, and organizing of

“Hear our students remember childhood games, mourn lost friends, recount 
shared events, encounter wildlife, and celebrate traditions...when you’re done 
reading, share this anthology with a friend. It is a gift to us from our children.” 

In “Racoon,” Nacoma Gainan (Salish), a seventh-grade student, tells a story 
which emphasizes the problems for individuals who are judged because they 
look like “criminals, even though [they] never did anything to deserve the kind 
of treatment” they got. This may be combined with Minerva Allen’s bilingual 
story about “Racoon the Bandit.” Made possible through a federal Title VII bi¬

The introduction to this collection suggests these stories may represent 
the “oldest surviving form of oral literature known to man.” The stories begin 
with Maheo, the Creator, turning mud into dust to make the “earth we walk 
on.” Maheo makes man to live in the south, and woman to live in the north, and 
he shows them the migratory patterns of birds and how the seasons will change. 
In the “The Great Race,” the buffalo men hold a race to settle the conflict be¬ 
tween humans and the buffalo. 

After the magpie wins the race for the people, the buffalo bull promises to 
supply the people “with meat, skins, and bones,” and he promises to teach the 
people “how to give a Sun Dance.” These stories teach about the interdepen¬ 
dent relationship between human beings and the animals, as well as between 
human beings and their environment. The stories also teach the importance of 
ritual and ceremony for the perpetuation of the good life.

Education, 1983. 32 pages. 

Genre: Biography 

Theme: Remembering the Old Ways, Change and Growth, 

Between Two Worlds 

Grade Level: Primary and Intermediate 

The stories of six 19th-century Cheyenne warriors and their battles, as 
told by those who participated in these events, are recounted in this collection. 
In the 1830s Big Head, a warrior and leader of the Kit Fox Society, led a war 
party of Cheyennes against the Utes and Shoshoni to take horses. Although 
seriously wounded and left for dead by his men, he survives and returns to his 
people. 

The second story about Mouse’s Road’s death in battle with the Kiowas 
and Commanches took place in 1837, and it comes from the Kiowas, since none 
of the Cheyennes lived to tell his story. “Perhaps the greatest honor a warrior 
could receive was that the story of his bravery be told and retold by his en¬ 
emies.” 

The third story is about White Bull, the most well-known medicine man 
among the Northern Cheyenne. The fourth story is about a Cheyenne woman 
warrior, Ehyophsta, Yellow Haired Woman, who died in 1915. 

The last two stories feature Sun’s Road, who fulfills a vow in battle, and 
Bull Could Not Rise Up, who risks his fife to recover his friend. Although the 
names may not sound familiar to those who are not Cheyenne, these men repre¬ 
sent the character and bravery which Cheyenne people today still admire and 
honor.

buffalo; and when Little Thunder returns to camp, the medicine man tells him 
that the wolf is now his medicine: “he is wise, able to take care of himself, and

The story of the conflict between Little Light (Son of the Morning Star) and

and disregard for the responsibilities between friends. When two friends are 
matched against each other in an arrow shooting contest, the loser forgets “all 
the traditions of friendship and generosity” and grows bitter when Little Light 
wins. However, the young man proves himself to the Thunder Bird and earns 
adoption, giving him the right to be called Blue Thunder. Other events follow, 
and the story ends with the affirmation that the young boy’s spirits are “at last 
united in friendship.”

According to Preston L. Stiffarm, Fred Gone Sr., a tribal member, recorded 
these stories in the original local syntax. They tell of the days when the White 
Clay People followed the buffalo. Most of the stories are accounts of personal 
exploits, but others are of “unusual events that happened in Gros Ventre 
hi story... which served to explain unnatural phenomenon that occurred in their 
daily lives. The White Clay people lived in a harsh and brutal world but they 
lived to survive and prosper amidst trial and tribulation and to tell of their 
exploits in their circle of life that the Creator had given to them.” 

“Grows Tallest—A Tepee” is a story from the “early days of the Gros Ventre 
Tribe” about a young man who follows a dream. While pursuing the commands 
in his dream, Southern Rabbit changes from being foolish to wise and is given

At 79 years, the half-sister of John Stands in Timber told Katheryn Weist 
the stories she had heard and lived through on the Northern Cheyenne Reser¬ 
vation. Those reservation years brought dramatic change to the Cheyenne people, 
and this memoir blends Cheyenne cultural ways with historical events and gov¬ 
ernment programs as they affected the people. With sadness she tells how times 
are different now, since people have moved to town: they eat white-man’s food 
and their teeth fall out; the men are educated and forget how to work, and they 
forget their relatives and drink too much. But she writes this memoir so her 
grandchildren will know what it was like for her and their people in the Old 













































Days. Several stories feature the Trickster character, but wise women succeed 
in outsmarting him. Although her stories are frequently tragic, her sense of 
humor, her personal strength, and her love of and commitment to her people 
and especially her grandchildren survive in this memoir. Because of the sensi¬ 
tivity of some sexual issues, teachers should select the readings.

LIFEWAYS AND STEREOTYPES 


BEING INDIAN IS: 

In my mind being Indian is: 

:putting up with whites' ways. 

:having your opinion not count. 

:being treated as if we are not supposed to be here. 
:being limited to land in our own country. 

:being watched extra closely or even 

being rejected by white owned stores, 
mot being able to speak our native tongue. , 

:being the butt of white jokes. 

:being called "prairie nigger" in white towns. 

:having some think we don't exist anymore. 

:being known as drunken dirty savages. 

.•people just turning their heads when an Indian accomplishes 
something which gains attention. 

:being put at the bottom of the list or at the end of the line.

Gratification * 

Through the great big swinging 
doors under the double arches, I sway 
slow and cool up to the clean, shiny 
counter. The clerk steps over from the fries 
bringing a warm, greasy smell with her smile. 

I order the $2.99 bacon double cheese burger 
with fries, sweet ‘n sour sauce, I don’t supersize. 
She beeps the register, grins and repeats 
my order like it fills her life 
to take my money. I pay, she makes me 
a frozen meal. I think, This lady is really nice, 
so I leave her a tip. As I walk out I look 
back at her snatching the money 
like it was food.

All My Relations 



uthor's Note: The resources listed in this section are intended to supple¬ 
ment the bibliography of Montana and regional Native American literature 
with materials that develop awareness of Native American culture and his¬ 
tory and that help educators incorporate Native American literature in the cur¬ 
riculum. 


♦ All My Relations: Sharing Native Values Through the Arts. Catherine Verrall 
and Lenore Keeshig-Tobias, Compilers. Canada: Canadian Alliance in 
Solidarity with Native Peoples, 1988. 

Genre: Story, Poetry, Drama, Art, Song 

Theme: Remembering the Old Ways, At Home Within Family, 

At Home Within Nature, At Home Within Circles 
Grade Level: Primary and Intermediate 

Intended primarily for non-Native teachers of children in grades K-6, "this 
kit is for parents, group leaders (Brownies, Guides, Clubs, camp, religious edu¬ 
cation...) and others who care...[about] discovering Native values in stories and 
music, poetry and symbols...[and] expressing these values through creative 
drama, words, songs, art, and action.... Inspired by the Elders, child-tested, com¬ 
piled by a teacher [f]or the survival of all the grandchildren—bird and tree and 
fish and 4-legged, as well as human. And for the survival of our mother the 
Earth.” 

Using the words of David Suzuki, Basil Johnston, Chief Dan George, and 
Chief Seattle, “The Beginning” offers an introduction to the purpose of this pub¬ 
lication. The “Stories” section features Cree, Okanagan, Seneca and Wabenaki, 
Ojibwe, Salish, and Iroquois stories. The “Poetry” section shows children how to 
“make a poem.” The “Symbols” section illustrates the following: Circle; all my 
relations; Mother Earth; Thanksgiving; 4 Elements—air, water, fire, rock; Moon/ 
Calendar; and Understandings of Drum, Elders, Feather, Hair, Moon, Pipe, Pow 
wow, Sweetgrass, Tobacco, Tree of Peace, Trickster, Turtle Island, and Wam¬ 
pum. Primary and Intermediate teachers find this an essential tool for provid¬ 
ing their students with creative, comprehensive, and authentic lessons from the 
Original Peoples of this land.

Bevis, William W. 


♦ Bevis, William W. Ten Tough Trips, Montana Writers and the West. Seattle, 

WA: University of Washington Press, 1990. 

Genre: Literary Criticism 

William Bevis is Professor of English at the University of Montana in 
Missoula, where he has established himself as a significant authority on the 
literature of Western America and of Montana in particular. Believing that 
discussions about literature should involve all people, Bevis has worked with 
the Montana Committee for the Humanities to bring his expertise and western

literatures to the general public. Clearly defining his terms, and drawing the 
reader into more personal communication through his use of the understood 
“you,” William Bevis succeeds in making literary scholarship accessible to lay 
readers through these “personal essays for a general audience.” 

Ten Tough Trips addresses issues of western identity through three phases 
in Montana’s literary history: stories “set in that nineteenth century of empire 
and hope”; works of Native American culture and literature from the late 1930s, 
including the collaborative works of Linderman and Plenty-Coups, and the sto¬ 
ries and novels of D’Arcy McNickle, and James Welch; and the “final phase, 
1960 to the present,” where realism shifts to psychological modernism. 

Most important for readers of Native American literatures, as well as for 
those who would better understand the “western” mind, is the essay “McNickle: 
Homing In”(92-108). Here Bevis explains the concept of “primitivism,” that 
“nature” is the opposite of civilization; it is this notion which “shapes the ex¬ 
treme ‘white plof” in literatures. Going West, Europeans and Americans were 
frequently fleeing civilization, to advance “with little or no regard for family, 
society, past, or place.” 

Furthermore, Europeans expected—(and Americans still do expect) wild 
and uncivilized Indians—since the Indians inhabited the American West. Con¬ 
trasting this view with the tribal world, Bevis goes on to describe that world as 
revealed in memoirs and contemporary novels. “... most Native American nov¬ 
els are not about going out, diverging, expanding, but about zooming in, con¬ 
verging, contracting.” The search for identity, for the Native American charac¬ 
ters in contemporary novels, “is not a matter of finding ‘one’s self,’ but of finding 
a ‘self that is transpersonal,” with respect to “society, past, and place.” As a 
result of western expansion, “European individualism came face to face with 
Third World tribalism” in a “huge collision of cultures and values...The result¬ 
ing conflicts and misunderstandings continue to this day.” 

His second essay, “Native Nature: Chickadee Jive”(109-116) deals with 
“primitivist expectations of the sacred earth prior to the evils of civilization,” 
and the contrasts between that notion and the Native American world, as exhib¬ 
ited in the novels of McNickle and Welch: ‘“Mother Earth’ is not wild. Nature is 
part of tribe ... unpredictable and various.” Ten Tough Trips is an excellent 
resource for teachers as well as students, especially for understanding the works 
of McNickle and Welch. 


♦ Bowker, Ardy (Eastern Cherokee). Sisters in the Blood: The Education of 

Women in Native America. Newton, MA: WEEA Publishing Center, 1993. 

354 pages. 

Genre: Cultural, Historical, and Sociological Resource 

In Sisters in the Blood, probably the most comprehensively researched study 
of Native Americans in education and of women in particular, Bowker examines 
the history of Indian education; racism and stereotyping; American Indian drop¬ 
outs; the correlation between substance abuse, problems with the law, low self¬ 
esteem, mental health problems and pregnancy with family background and 
school factors. Part 2 reflects the information gained when “American Indian 
female high school dropouts and high school and college graduates talk about 
their lives,” and Part 3 addresses solutions based on the information gained 
from the research. 

One of Bowker’s most positive conclusions relates to her attitude towards 
young Native American women: 

“...I completed this study with a renewed sense of pride in being a 'Sister

in the Blood.’ The women in this study demonstrated a striking ethos of 
family support, independence and interdependence (not dependence), and 
resourcefulness. Many of them shouldered the burden of family responsi¬ 
bilities, often at great cost to any personal ambition. And however painful 
their personal experiences were and are, they have maintained their com¬ 
mitment to family and, in the majority of cases, to their traditional values 
and cultures” (267). 

Some Montana reservation school districts have made this book mandatory read¬ 
ing for teachers in the school system; and with Bowker’s conclusions regarding 
the critical position of teachers in the lives of these women, it, is easy to see why 
they have made such a decision.

♦ Dempsey, Hugh A. Big Bear: The End of Freedom. Lincoln, Nebraska: 

University of Nebraska Press, 1984.198 pages. 

Genre: Biography 

Grade Level: Intermediate and Secondary 

While teaching a course at Rocky Boy Reservation during the summer of 
1974, Hugh Dempsey met Big Bear’s grandson, Four Souls. After listening to 
many stories “about Big Bear and his family and of the terrible struggle the 
Cree had gone through to gain a reservation in Montana after the Riel Rebel¬ 
lion,” Dempsey decided to pursue research which would lead to the publication 
of this biography. Big Bear: The End of Freedom tells not only Big Bear’s story, 
but also the story of the Cree people—their culture and social systems; the mi¬ 
gration from the north-central woodlands to the plains in Canada and Montana; 
conflicts with Blood, Blackfoot and Crow people; varying relationships with the 
Assiniboine and the Ojibwa people; hunting and trading practices with both 
Indians and whites; and their impoverishment and death due to the disappear¬ 
ance of buffalo, starvation and disease. 

Born in 1825, Big Bear, a respected warrior leader, was also a holy man 
who trusted the power of his visions to lead him. Even as a young boy, he had a 
vision of the coming white man. Relying on extensive research, Dempsey goes 
beyond biography to cover the Louis Riel rebellion against the Canadian gov¬ 
ernment, especially as it involved Big Bear and his people. Dempsey’s depen¬ 
dence on documentation and on the remembered stories of Big Bear’s descen¬ 
dants makes this a credible historical work. Intermediate and secondary stu¬ 
dents will find Big Bear: The End of Freedom both interesting and readable. 
Dempsey believes the “bottom line of the whole dispute” between the Indians 
and the Canadian government was “hunger,” suggesting that the government 
could have avoided the terrible violence had they begun their “agricultural pro¬ 
gram" earlier: “Big Bear had tried to sow the seeds of communication and coop¬ 
eration between Indians and whites, but the seeds had fallen on barren ground.”

Oklahoma Press; Indian Tribes of Alberta, Glenbow Museum Press; Red Crow, 
Warrior Chief, University of Nebraska Press.

♦ Farr, William E. The Reservation Black feet, 1882-1945: A Photographic 

History of Cultural Survival. Washington: University of Washington 

Press, 1984. 210 pages. 

Genre: Historical and Cultural Resource 

This resource is a photographic study of the Blackfeet, covering a time 
span of 63 years. Photographs have been gathered from many private collec¬ 
tions, depicting the dignity of the people. According to Denise .Juneau, Blackfeet/ 
Hidatsa educator and native of Browning, Montana, written captions reflect a 
strong bias by the author making references to “squaw men,” portraying full- 
bloods as less capable, less intelligent than mixed-bloods. Facts are accurate 
but some opinions of the author are questionable. The book helps the student 
visualize Blackfeet tribal history, cultural values and lifestyle. Through the 
photographs one could make a comparative study of the great changes the People 
have undergone in a short period of time. 

♦ Fedullo, Mick. It's Like My Heart Pounding: Imaginative Writing for 

American Indian Students. Ogden, Utah: Mountain West Educational 

Equity Center, Weber State College, 1990(c). 

Genre: Educational Resource 

Mick Fedullo now lives on the Crow Reservation in Pryor, Montana. He 
has taught writing to Indian students throughout the United States, and this 
excellent publication represents his educational philosophy, his approaches for 
the teaching of imaginative writing, and eighteen specific assignments which 
may be adapted for all grade levels. 

Chapter One: “Copyright; Plagiarism; Words Not to Use; Titles; Stanzas; 
When and How to End a Poem; Rhythm; The Matter of Rhythm; Revision.” 
Fedullo recommends this curriculum for grades four through nine, but any of 
the lessons may be adapted for lower or higher grades. Even teachers who have 
little experience with writing poetry will find this resource easy to use. 

Chapter Two: “Setting the Mood; Technical Terms; Focusing; Writing Time; 
Creative Silence; Positive Criticism.” 

The eighteen lessons “follow a sequence which advances from an emphasis 
on learning new expressive language techniques to exploring both personal and 
tribal values, while always involving the students in writing their own experi¬ 
ences.” Fedullo has found that older students are more interested in the values, 
and so he suggests teachers might want to “work backwards, or mix up the 
value-oriented lessons with the technique-oriented lessons”(vii). 

Fedullo suggests his “Formula for Success” is the “four-step” pattern: 

(1) Model poems, (2) discussions, (3) writing time, and (4) oral reading of work 
Fedullo doesn’t intend to create a multitude of “Indian poets;” instead he wants 
to “take the fear out of writing” and to “build the self-confidence so necessary in 
completing an education and facing the future.” Evidence of his program’s suc¬ 
cess exists in the enthusiastic communities of poets he leaves behind, and in the 
increasing number of publications which feature his students’ poetry. No other 
“Imaginative Writing” resource for teaching Indian children, or for teaching non- 
Indian children who are living in community with Indian peoples, can equal this 
one.

In an easy-to-read narrative, Fedullo, an adopted Crow, discusses his ex¬ 
periences with the various tribal groups and the way those experiences caused 
him to drop his own stereotypes for more realistic images of Indian peoples to¬ 
day. Light of the Feather can be used as a resource for discussion of contempo¬ 
rary Indian life among different tribes, but it can also be used to discuss stereo¬ 
types and the way individuals overcome them.

Genre: Culture and Biography 

In the preface, Fitzgerald comments: "This book is intended to give us in¬ 
sights into the religious center of the Crow Indians through the eyes of Thomas 
Yellowtail...Modem society, with its materialistic outlook, has orientations com¬ 
pletely opposite the concepts of the old-time Indians and of those present-day 
Indians faithful to their heritage." 

Told in first person, Thomas Yellowtail closes his memoir with the follow¬ 
ing words: 

No one person is to blame for our present state. Everyone who fails to five 
up to his spiritual duties causes further problems for everyone. Therefore, 
I tell people, "Don’t criticize your neighbor; that will not help anyone. It is 
not good to fight Indian against Indian; it just makes matters worse. Work 
on yourself first; prepare yourself to meet your Lord."

Cultural and Personal Loss and Survival 
Grade Level: Intermediate 

Having grown up in the Pacific Northwest, Hirschi worked as the fisheries 
biologist to protect the salmon habitat for the Port Gamble S’Klallam Tribe. His 
first book about the S’Klallam people was Seya’s Song. In a letter I received

from Hirschi, he wrote, “I like [this book] because it says some things I wish we 
were taught in school - back when ALL my S’Klallam friends dropped out of 
school in eighth grade. We were taught nothing about their culture.” 

Illustrated by Deborah Cooper, using the faces of S’Klallam people, and 
with tum-of-the-century photographs by Edward S. Curtis, this book provides a 
clear description of the history of the People of Salmon and Cedar since 1850 
and the cultural practices which surround the salmon. It contradicts the stereo¬ 
type of Chief Seattle as portrayed in books like Susan Jeffers’ Brother Eagle, 
Sister Sky, which uses an 1855 Seattle speech that Hirschi says has been copied 
and changed many times. 

People of Salmon and Cedar begins with an excerpt from Seattle’s speech 
in 1850 when he welcomed white settlers, but Hirschi follows this optimism 
with recorded destructions in population and culture: 

Within ten years, during the 1850’s, as many as nine of every ten North¬ 
west Coast Indians died of diseases. They vanished because they were not 
immune to smallpox and other diseases.... The new ways of the United 
States citizens replaced traditions of the Squamish, S’Klallam, Chimacum, 
Quileutte, Makah, Tulalip, Nisqually, Skagit, Lummi, Muckleshoot, 
Duwamish, Quinault, and other Northwest Coast tribes. (3) 

Following chapters describe the importance of the rivers, the salmon, the 
cedars, and the ways the Salmon People nearly starved because of the construc¬ 
tion of dams and unregulated fishing and logging practices by non-Indians, “...al¬ 
most 90 percent of the original forest is now gone”(29). However, as a result of 
court battles to regain fishing rights, the tribes won the “Boldt Decision,” which 
gives them the right to 50 percent of all salmon and 50 percent of all fishing 
management. Hirschi’s Afterword asks young readers to imagine what it would 
be like to lose their language and their right to sing and pray in their language, 
and he closes with the following hope: “Once the ocean, river, and forest are 
healthy, all cultures will be able to share that great wealth, borrowing from but 
not destroying the future.” 

Although it is written for the intermediate grade level, the pictures and 
short sentences make it easy for teachers to read aloud to younger students, and 
older students can examine the ways Hirschi achieves an objective yet sensitive 
narrative voice.

Genre: Biography and History 

In this historical narrative, Howard integrates the life and death of Louis 
Riel with the history of contemporary Canadian and United States military and 
economic policies and actions, as well as with the history of other related Indian 
peoples—Sitting Bull and the Sioux, who sought refuge with the Metis and the 
Cree people under Poundmaker and Little Bear in Canada. From a settlement 
called Rupert’s Land, present day Winnipeg, Riel fought for the rights of these 
people of French and Cree ancestry to live independently as a nation, with the 
right to choose whether to be aligned with Canada or the United States, and he 
fought for their right to own and manage their own land. Louis Riel led a politi¬ 
cal and religious crusade from Manitoba, to Montana, and finally to Regina,

Canada where he was tried and hanged for treason against Canada and the 
Queen. 

Howard’s story is certainly a defense of Riel and his cause, but he does 
include substantial evidence to support a possible insanity or at least fanatic 
claim against Riel. It would seem Howard has explored every possible docu¬ 
ment which would explain and clarify Riel’s life and purpose, but the book fails 
in areas where he has moved outside this specific expertise. For example, his 
account of the motivation and role of Sitting Bull, in the Sioux and Cheyenne 
resistance, conflicts with those of others who actually knew Sitting Bull. Many 
descendants of the Metis who followed Riel are scattered all over Montana to¬ 
day, but they know their heritage and their loss of a homeland, and they con¬ 
tinue to grieve for one of the strongest hopes for Native nationhood that ever 
persisted in contemporary North America.

The Hungry Wolfs provide black and white pictures of Native children 
from the Plateau, Plains and Pueblo peoples. 

As part of our family’s cultural life, we have a large collection of old photo¬ 
graphs showing Indian people, their camps, and scenes of many traditional 
activities. Among our favorites of these are ones that include native chil¬ 
dren, perhaps because four of them have grown up in our own household. 
Accompanying the photographs are the names (when available), the tribes, 
places, and the approximate dates of the photos, as well as the Hungry Wolfs’ 
explanation of the background of the situation in the picture. Despite the im¬ 
pact of European-American culture on these people “their more modem outlook 
[has helped] to bring about changes that have resulted in people like the Sioux 
still maintaining their heritage near the year 2000" (30).
