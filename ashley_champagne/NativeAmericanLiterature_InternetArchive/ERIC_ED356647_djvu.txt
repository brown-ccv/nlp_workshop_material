ABSTRACT 

It is argued that despite a common assumption to the 
contrary, there is children's literature appropriate to students of 
English as a Second Language (ESL) aged 9-14, First, the unique needs 
and characteristics of the target population are examined. This 
population consists of 1 iirited-Engl ish^prof icient speakers, usually 
immigrants or refugees froa a variety of linguistic and geographic 
backgrounds, most at lower socioeconomic levels, and relatively 
unfamiliar with Ajnerican culture and history. For these purposes, 
they are defined as having lived in the United States under 2 years, 
generally enrolled in bilingual or ESL instruction. At this age, gaps 
bet^pieen language and content area subjects and between chronological 
age and educational age may be widening. It is recommended that 
literature have: age^appropriate theme; simple language; limited use 
of metaphor and unfamiliar experiences; use of rhyme; unambiguous 
plot; realistic but simple dialogue; potential for reading aloud; 
brevity; and good illustrations. Suggested themes include: familiar 
fairy tales, legends, and fables; American culture and customs; 
modern American life; American history; immigrant experiences; 
cross-cultural experiences; and native country culture. Specific 
titles are noted, (MSE)

Children's Lltarature for 
Limited English Proficient Students, &ses 9~14 

I - Introduction 

This paper will focus on children's literature particularly 

appropriate for limited English proficient (LEP) speakers, ages 

9-14, usually enrolled in upper elementary, middle or junior high 

school classes. Finding lit3rature for this age LEP student is 

particularly challenging because the topic, plot and 

illustrations need to be chronologically age-appropriate but the 

language, vocabulary and story complexity need to be 

educationally age-appropriate. That usually has been interpreted 

as literature written for younger native speakers, those in the 

early elementary grades, ages about 6-9, However, much of this 

literature does not meet the needs of these older LEP students. 

One way elementary English as a Second Language (ESL) 

teachers address this problem is to use children's literature 

with their younger students but to abandon it with the older ones 

in favor of basal textbooks, I suggest that children's 

literature can be successfully integrated into all elementary, 

middle and junior high ESL curriculums. But proof of that 

hypothesis is not my main purpose in this paper. Rather, my 

intention here is to prove that there is ample children's 

literature appropriate for the 9-14 year old limited English 

proficient (LEP) speakers.

The outline of my paper will be as follows: 

I . Introduction 

II. Target Population Defined 

III. Literature Criteria Established 

IV. Book Selection Analyzed 

V. Summary and Conclusions 

To acquaint the readers with this population (Part II), I will 
describe it in terms of linguistic, cultural, socio-economic and 
educational background. As one's background inevitably impacts 
on one's present needs, I will also describe these in terms of 
education. I will then carefully establish literature criteria 
for the target population (Part III), after which I will analyze 
individual books according to those criteria (Part IV). Most of 
the books will be recommended, but a few have been included as 
negative contrasts. I will close with a summary and conclusions 
(Part V) . 

II . The Tarjget Population (TP) 

Limited English Proficient (LEP) speakers refer usually to 
recent immigrant or refugees, although in the Washington, DC area 
it also includes some diplomats and diplomatically-related 
personnel as well. LEP families come from various geographical 
and linguistic backgrounds, with Hispanic, Vietnamese, Cambodian. 
Korean and Chinese being the largest language groups in this 
metropolitan area. Those famili'=*c and individuals who 

successfully make it to the United States are usually courageous, 
persistent, resourceful and of at isast some financial means.

Nevertheless, when they first arrive, the majority occupy our 
lower socio-economic class, at least until they learn the system, 
including English. They almost all share an unf amiliari ty with 
our language, culture, customs and history. They, of course, 
differ in their motivation and ability to learn enough to move up 
the socio-economic ladder and become successful Americans. 

The LEP school-age children precariously straddle their two 
new cultures, that of their family and the school. Our 
educational system has addressed their needs by creating two 
types of programs. In the first, bilingual programs, instruction 
is conducted in both English and the native language. In the 
second, English as a Second Language (ESL) programs, English is 
the sole medium of communication. The later, the more 

predominant, is more of a melting pot environment, with students 
from various countries speaking different languages. 

For the purposes of this paper, LEP students will be defined 
as those enrolled in the U.S. school system less than two years 
and usually attending either an ESL or bilingual program for 
second language learning and educational assistance. Usually 
after students have been in this country for over three years, 
they have achieved some measure of communicative competence and 
the school system integrates them into the mainstream classes, 
with little, if any, special consideration or assistance. 

The older the student, the more difficult it is to close the 
gap between language and content area subjects. For LEP 
students, ages 9-14, this gap is just beginning to widen. Most 



native speakers have learned to read by now, nursery rhymes and 
fairy tales are now assumed common background knowledge, they 
have been socialized into the school system and the friendly 
field trips to the outside community (e.g. fire station* 
supermarket; have been taken and absorbed. Enter an 11 year-old 
Cambodian, recently arrived from two yeoirs in a resettlement camp 
in the Philippines, who knows nothing of the above experiences. 
He may or may not be literate in his own language, he may or may 
not have even been to school before and if so. most probably in 
classes of 30-50 students where individual attention, behavior 
and educational expectations were different than our system's. 
And so» there comes to exist another possible significant gap-- 
between a student's educational age in our U.S. system and his 
chronological age. Bilingual and ESL programs try to address 
thj,se needs and close the gaps as quickly as possible. 

III. Literature Criteria 

Children's literature criteria for 9-lA year old LEPS needs 

to take into account both the characteristics of the literature 

itself and also those of the target population (TP) . I will do 

this first with a set of ten criteria appropriate for all books 

considered for the TP and then with a series of recommended book 

themes and literary genres. 

1. Books should address an age-appropriate theme, 
topic or story line. Accordingly, protagonists should 
be the students' age or older. This should be 
reflected in the Illustrations as well. Nursery 
rhymes, for example, would be considered too immature 
in subject matter, tone and usually illustrations. 



2. At the same time, language and sentence 
patterns should be farriy simple and somewhat 
controlled, with tenses, structures and vocabulary 
repeated often throughout a book. 

3. Related to this» there should be limited use 
of metaphorical language and limited references to 
unfamiliar experiences. 

4. As many books as possible should include 
rhyming. This is an excellent tool for memorizing 
(always helpful in language learning) and for visual 
phonetic transfer. This can be done in a mature way, 
with songs and poems in picture-book format. 

5. The plot should be fairly straightforward, 
chronological in order and unambiguous. Action should 
predominate, with characters and descriptions clear but 
not complex . 

6. Dialogue should be used as much as 
realistically possible, but books with dialects and 
excessive use of idiomatic expressions should be 
avoided . 

7. Books should lend themselves to bting 
successful read-alouds. Most literature for ESL 
students should be first introduced orally, with the 
teacher reading. In that way, students are exposed to 
the stimulation of language beyond their reading level . 
This serves as a motivator to improving their own 
reading skills. At the same time, it also focuses 
primary attention on the basic listening and speaking 
components of language development. 

8. Books should be fairly short, either as a 
whole, or by chapters so that they can be completed in 
5-10 minute sittings. This is a realistic criterion* 
given the LEP student's concentration span in English, 
desirability of frequent re-readings and short ESL 
class periods. 

9. Related to the above, books should be single 
volumes, as opposed to part of a collection, wherever 
pCGSioie. This applies most often to fairy tales, 
poetry and songs. Part of this is for the student's 
sense of completion and also because single picture 
books usually are more fully illustrated than 
collections . 



10. This leads to one of the most significant 
criterion: illustrations. They should be clear and 
dramatic, ideally able to almost tell the story on 
their own. Both the teachers and students depend on 
these pictures to explain new vocabulary or 
experiences. The particular style is not as important 
as its full visual description of the mood ana scene. 
Beginning ESL students will be "reading" the 
illustrations, much like pre-schoolers. For this 
reason, the amount of text per page should be limited, 
with illustrations predominant. With increased 

langauge proficiency, the balance should shift to more 
text . 

Typeb of literature should be varied to expand a LEP 
student's cross-cultural horizons. This, of course, is also true 
of native speakers, but the variety need not always be as 
carefully selected for them because one can assume other sources 
of collected cultural experiences (i.e. "americanization" ) . 
Children's literature should introduce the TP to the following 
themes : 

1. Familiar fairy tales, legends and fables of childhood 

2. American culture and customs, including family life and 

customs 

3. Modern American life experiences (e.g. hospitals, 
shopping malls) 

4. American history 

5. Immigrant experiences 

6. Cross-cultural experiences 

7. Their own cultural origins and traditions 

A variety of literary genres can be effectively used to 
intr-^duce the above themes: 



1. 


Songs ("singable books") 


2. 


Fairy tales 


3. 


Legends, myths and fables 




Poetry 


S. 


Novels 


6. 


Historical fiction 


7. 


Biography 


8. 


Picture book non-fiction 



73 

7 

Within these genres » users should seek, whenever possible, 
quality single-volume picture books. For most novels, however, 
this is neither possible nor desirable. One does want to 
challenge students with increasingly longer and more demanding 
selections. Even in those cases, however, illustrations should 
remain a prime consideration. 

IV . Book Analyses 

The book selections represent nost themes and genres, with 
the majority sharing a picture book format. The order of genre 
presentation is generally as follows: 

1 . Singable books 

2. Fairy tales 

3 . Legends 

4 . Poetry 

5. Non-fiction 

6. Novels 

The literature selections have been grouped by themes as well. 
Comprehensive bibliographical information on each work dis'^ussed 
is given within the paper and also compiled as a separate 
bibliography at the end. 

Singable Books 

When I First Came to this Land by Oscar Brand and 
illustrated by Doris Burn (Putnam & Sons, 197^), a popular 
folksong, has been effectively transformed into a simple but 
successful book. The song, written by Brand in 1946, tells of a 
19th century European immigrant's struggles to develop the land 



7^ 

6 

and find happiness in the United States. The unnamed immigrant 
first appears as a bedraggled but appealing adolescent singing 
the lines, ''When I first came to this land, I was not a wealthy 
man" (p. 1). Through his hard work» he gains one thing at a 
time, from farm to shack to animals to family. All is not easy, 
but he ends each addition with the upbeat refrain, "But the land 
was sweet and good and I did what I could*' (p. 4) . The message 
is sophisticated, yet the large print, rhymes and cumulative 
verses make it appealing for the TP. The soft browr and white 
illustrations lend humor and add explanation. The music and 
words are helpfully reprinted in full at the end. Because of the 
rhymes »nd catchy melody. LEP students easily learn and memorize 
the entire book . 

Although most 20th century immigrants have a more urban 
experience, this connection with the American-pioneer, rural- 
immigrant past is a positive link to the American dream. As this 
book meets all of the establishea criteria, except the use of 
dialogue, I highly recommend it to immigrant children of this 
age. 

Over the River and Through the Moods by Lydia Maria Child 
and illustrated by Brinton Turkle (Coward & Coward, 1974) 
captures the popular Thanksgiving song of the title's name in a 
stunning picture book. Most Americans will be familiar with the 
first and last verses of this holiday song, marking the beginning 
and end of this happy family journey to grandfather's house. 



1 

kJ 



Over the river and through the wood 
To grandfather's house we go; 
The horse knows the way 
To carry the sleigh. 

Through the white and drifted snovi . (p. 1-3) 

Over the river and through the wood. 

Now grandmother's cap I spy! 

Hurray for the fun! 

Is the pudding done? 

Hurrah for the pumpkin pie! (p. 25) 

But how many know the other ten verses, each also beginning with 

the same first Line and each adding something special to the 

building excitement. Set in a northern area, it also describes 

winter activities. As in most viell-done singable books, the 

words and music are reprinted in full at the end. 

What makes this book so successful for LEP students is the 
song choice combined with Brinton Turkle's magnificent 
illustrations and clever book design. They are exquisitely 
crafted with fine details of this upper miadle class family in 
the late 19th century and their trip from the son's home in town, 
through the countryside to his parents* ample farm estate. The 
illustrations capture the happiness and excitement of the text. 

Turkle's illustrations alternate between half -page black and 
white line drawings set in wide orange-gold frames with an 
elaborate black-line border design and full two-page color 
paintings framed in the same border design but thinner and less 
elaborate. The former, the black and whites, represent the 
grandparents preparing the Thanksgiving feast and awaiting their 
children and grandchildren. The later, m full color, depict the 
son and his family driving in their sleigh to grandma's. 



This Is an Idealised Thanksgiving of d happy extended family 
of another century, but It Is part of our heritage and as such 
deserves to be shared with LEP children unfamiliar with our 
celebrations. I have also used this book, especially the 
illustrations, to successfully Introduce ESL classes to family 
relationships, holiday foods, winter activities and town vs. 
country contrasts. Highly recommended. 

Non-f Ictlon 

Thanksgiving Day by Gail Gibbons (Holiday House, 1983) 
provides an excellent non-fiction coverage of this holiday, also 
in picture book format and also highly appropriate for the TP. 
Her illustrations are not the artistic masterpieces of Turkle or 
Galdone. with her bright. primary colors lying rather flat and 
the actions stilted. However, each picture clearly explains the 
ssentence or two of text below. The importance of this cannot be 
underestimated for LEP students. She traces briefly the 
holidciy's origins and traditions and describes a realistic, 
modern-day celebration. Although she uses short simple 
sentences with a predictable noun-verb-object pattern of seldom 
more than 12 words, the text is not boring because it is chocked 
full of interesting information. 

Thanksgiving combines elements of the universal harvest 
festival with specifics of our first immigrant experience. As 
such, it is our most uniquely major U.S. holiday. Nearly every 
elementary ESL teacher struggles to explain it to her students. 



These two books together can help make that task both easier and 
more enjoyable. 

Fairy Tales 

Charles Perault's Cinderella is perhaps our best known fairy 
tale, embodying many concepts: the "rags to riches" dream, the 
mean step-mocher » magical transformation, a benevolent fairy 
godmother, a handsome young prince and as always in fairy tales, 
the good, kind and beautiful overcoming. in the end, the bad, 
mean and ugly. By ten years old, most young Americans have 
absorbed the Cinderella story into their common knowledge base. 
We refer to it and build upon it. As newcomers to cur culture, 
LEP students should be introduced to this story. most 
appropriately in the ESL classes. The story, unlike Hansel and 
Gretel or some other fairy tales, is quite mature, yet relatively 
straightforward and uncomplicated. In addition, the story 
requires a fair amount of dialogue, one of the criterion. The 
choice then becomes which Cinderella to recommend. 

I would first eliminate Cinderella as part of a collection 
because there is too much text on each page and too few 
illustrations. I then selected for consideration the Cinderella 
retold and illustrated by Marcia Brown (Scribners. 19Sa> and the 
Cinderella retold and illustrated by Paul Galdone (McGraw-Hill. 
1978). The story line of both translations are quite similar, 
but Brown's is more detailed, using more complex langauge 
structures, more idiomatic expression^ and metaphors. 



12 

Ab an example, compare the texts of the some passage; 

Cinderella slept on a wretched straw pallet in a 
miserable garret away up on top of the house. Her 
sisters lay on beds of the latest fashion in fine 
chambers with inlaid floors and great mirrors in which 
they could admire themselves from the tops of their 
silly heads to the bottom of their feet. 

The poor girl put up with everything. She dared 
not complain, even to her father. He would only have 
scolded her, because-alas ! -he was tied hand and foot to 
his wife's apron strings. (Brown, 195'* » p. 3) 

The girl slept up in the attic on a lumpy straw 
mat while her stepsisters had fine rooms with inlaid 
floors, soft beds and tall mirrors, in which they could 
admire themselves head to foot. 

She suffered all patiently, not daring to complain 
to her father, for his new wife ruled him completely. 
(Galdone, 1976, p. 5-6) 



For Brown, that text is 1/2 page, while for Galdone 1 1/2 
pages. With less text on each page, the illustrator has more 
on;">rtunity to divide the story inCo more illustrations. 
Furthermore, although both versions contain illustrations on each 
page, Galdone 's version has nine more pages and hence nine more 
illustrations, plus having the advantage of being larger. 
Larger-sized books are generally better for classroom use because 
groups of students can see them more easily. 

Artistically, the illustrations themselves are strikingly 
different. Brown's are soft, with fine-lined drawings and a 
predominance of warm pastels. Details and background fade 
together. Galdone 's, on the other hand, are strong and dramatic, 
with a full palette used. Including a lot of browns and grays. 

Compare, for example, the illustrations of the texts quoted 
above. Galdone devotes a full page to Cinderella's attic. 



ij 



painted with somber grays, browns and blues and enough details to 
visually explain the term "attic" and also to evoke its coldness. 
Contrasted on the facing page is a highly decorated, bright bed 
chamber with all the details described in the text carefully 
depicted. Brown's illustrations, on the other hand, show a fuzzy 
pinK bedroom scene on one page and on the other. a small picture 
of a forlorn Cinderella, crouched near something, presumably a 
hearth. Galdone's illustrations, almost by themselves, teil the 
story, a significant advantage for LEP students. 

Because of the simpler text and clearer, more numerous 
illustrations, I highly recommend Galdone's Cinderella over 
Brown's, 

Legends and Fables 

Legends of how things came to be (often referred to as 
"pourquoi stories") comprise another related genre. They are 
very age-appropriate for 9-14 year olds, who are beginning to 
question the world around them. Answers can come from legends of 
diverse cultures. 

The Gift of the Sacred Dog by Paul Goble (Bradbury Press, 
1980) spins the fascinating tale of how horses came to the Native 
Americans of the Great Plains. An adolescent boy, seeking relief 
for his hungry tribe of buffalo hunters, approaches the Great 
Spirit, who responds to his prayerful cries with the gift of the 
sacred dog (i.e. horses). 



For many reasons this is an excellent choice for the TP. 
First, the protagonist is of a similar age, or perhaps even 
older. Second, the strong colorful artwork is aesthetically 
exciting visually clear and helpfully detailed. Third, the book 
introduces LEP students to a positive, historical portrayal of 
Native Americans, a minority culture with which many recent 
immigrants are probably unfamiliar. This is important because 
when Native Americans are taught as a social studies unit in the 
4-8th grades, teachers assume an earlier introduction to the 
topic. Fourth, the language is relatively uncomplicated, with 
mostly simple or compound sentence patterns and few metaphors or 
idiomatic expressions. Fifth, the amount of text per page is 
relatively short » about 6-10 lines, 4-8 sentences, allowing ample 
room for the visual explanation as well. And finally, this 
simply is quality children's literature. Why shouldn't: these 
students be exposed to the best? 

Users should be aware that this legend does refer to a 
spiritual power and includes short prayers of petition and 
thanksgiving, recognizing the Spirit's power in granting these 
requests. A teacher's decision to choose this book for her class 
should include a sensitivity to the issues of prayer and religion 
in her individual school district. 

If an ESL class enjoys this legend, one could follow up on 
the Native American theme with The Girl Mho Loved Mild Horses , 
also by Paul Goble (Bradbury. 1979} , which was awarded the 1979 
Caldecott Medal . While it is approximately the same level of 



81 

15 

language difficulty, text per page and book length, it has a 
slightly more complex story line, challenging the intermediate 
learner to a higher level of comprehension. This legend tells of 
an adolescent girl who so loved wild horses that she ran with 
them, with a somewhat unexpected but very satisfying ending. It 
is a masterful blend of animal story, fantasy, mystery and 
romance. It appeals especially to young adolescent ^irls whose 
attraction to horses appears to be an international quality. It 
is "safer" than The Gift of the Sacred Dog because it contains no 
religious references. Although the book publishers recommend 
both of these books for pre-school through 2nd grade (4-7 year 
olds), I find them both highly appropriate for much older ESL 
learners because of the age of the protagonists, mature themes 
and sophisticated art work. Both are highly recommended. 

Poetry 

Poetry removes the written language one step further from an 
informal conversational register. It usually adds metaphors, 
references to past events and extra description. It also uses 
altered sentence rhythms and patterns and unusual word choices 
("literary language"). For all these reasons it is a difficult 
genre for LEP students. The songs described earlier (pages 7-10) 
can be used as an introduction to poetry. More traditional 
poems, however, are best postponed until the intermediate to 
advanced levels. Nevertheless, the established criteria still 
apply and selections can be made for this TP. 



3^ 

16 

I have chosen Paul Revere 's Ride by Henry w. Longfellow, 
illustrated by Paul Galdone (Crowell, 1963) as my example of this 
genre. Longfellow's famous epic poem of American revolutionary 
courage was originally published over 100 years ago as part of a 
larger volume, Tales of a Wayside Inn (1863). Galdone's powerful 
artwork, which not only explains the plot but also conveys its 
spirit, brings the poem dramatically to life in this picture book 
edition . 

This poem speaks of our North American fight for 
independence two centuries ago. It is an appropriate choice for 
the TP because it blends an introduction to American history with 
a focus on a courageous episode of freedom fighting, something 
with which many recent political refugees can identify. as units 
on the American revolution spirally reappear throughout the 
middle school years, continually building upon previous 
knowledge, ESL teachers should help their students build up that 
reservoir of background information, 

This poem also exemplifies the challenge of poetic language 
for this TP, as described on the previous page. The language not 
withstanding, action predominates over description and Galdone' s 
stunning illustrations help the LEP student to understand the 
period's events and drama. Highly recommended. 

By way of contrast, a far less satisfying edition of the 
same poem is Paul Revere 's Ride illustrated by Nancy Winslow 
Parker (Greenwillow , 1985). The difference lies in the artwork 



17 



and book layout. Winslow^s style is flat and lifeless, somewhat 
reminiscent of Gail Gibbons (see Thanksgiving Day, p. 10). Its 
cartoon-like effect trivializes Longfellow's poetic mastery. On 
each page the art and text are divided by a black line and both 
set within a rectangular box. This adds to the stiltedness of 
the book's design, reducing further its quintessential dramatic 
spirit. In its favor, the book does offer a two-page prose 
introduction, explaining some of the historical background to 
Revere' s ride, a map of the route itself and a glossary defining 
some geographical and military vocabulary used in the text. As a 
teacher, I would "borrow" these three textual aids from Parker's 
version to use with the body of Galdone*s edition. 

Non-Fiction 

To expand awareness of the American revolutionary period for 
LEP students, ESL teachers should turn to non-fiction. I 
recommend the biography of Paul Revere by Jean Fritz and 
illustrated by Margot Tomes (McCann & Goeghegan, 1973). Her 
biography encompasses his entire life, not just "The Big Ride", 
painting Revere as an energetic patriot and engaging fellow. It 
is well-written for the upper-elementary grades, ages 8-12. 
Introduced as an ESL read-aloud, it could, with teacher 
assistance, be understood by intermediate level LEP students of 
that age. 

The challenge here is as much comprehension of a "foreign" 
historical era as it is language and vocabulary. For two reasons 



18 

Fritz seems particularly well-suited for that task. First, her 
inclusion of off-beat facts and unusual details provide specific 
handlebars for students unfamiliar not only with our history but 
with our entire culture. Second, Tomes' illustrations on nearly 
every page help the reader to envision the colonial era 
Although I firi her neo-primiti ve J5tyle unappealing, questions of 
artistic style in my criteria are less important than clarity and 
detail. This she does satisfactorily. 

Although fully illustrated, Paul Revere is a step towards 
longer, more challenging literature for LEP students. Its Ai 
pages, for example, cannot be realistically completed in one or 
even two class periods. Despite its longer length, however, it 
stixl evenly balances text and illustrations. 

It is beyond the scope of this paper to consider in depth 
books for 9-1^ year old LEP students that move further along the 
spectrum towards more text and less illustrations. I will, 
however, touch upon two, the first non^fiction and the second, a 
novel - 

The Land I Lost by Huynh Quang Nhuong and illustrated by Vo- 
Dinh Mai (Harper & Row, 1982) relates a series of true stories 
about the author's exciting childhood adventures in his 
Vietnamese village before '*The War". His experiences are rich 
with dramas of exotic animals and cultural customs. This book 
does for Vietnamese village life what Laura wilder 's Little House 
series did for American pioneer life. It is an important part of 



10 



19 

Vietnam's social history. And, as the Vietnamese become 
Vietnamese-Americans, their history becomes part of ours as well. 
This is a book well-worth sharing in mainstream as well as ESL 
classes for enhancing cross-cultural awareness. Highly 
recommended . 

Novels 

In the Year of the Boar and Jackie Robinson by Bette Lao 
Lord and illustrated by Marc Simcnt (Harper & Row, 1984) 
describes the author's own childhood immigrant experiences in 
Brooklyn, New York. Although the protagonist, Shirley Temple 
Wong, is only eight, she functions in an older age group. 
Therefore, the novel stretches upward to the target age. Quite a 
long novel (169 pages), it can be completed in a month's time if 
read-aloud a few pages daily. It is an excellent read-aloud 
because of its fast pace and humor. In addition, it is a real 
find for ESL classes because it addresses, in a well-written, 
age-appropriate style, the theme of a young female's cross- 
cultural adjustment to a contemporary U.S. urban environment, 
touching upon topics from school to sports to social interaction. 
Her inclusion of pre-teen colloquial speech used in the numerous, 
short dialogues lends additional touches of reality to the novel, 
as well as making it even more acwSssibie to LEP students. Not 
to be missed !

V Summary and Conclusion 

I set out to prove that there is children's literature 
appropriate for LEP students in grades ^-8, ages 9-1^, This paper 
has done that by evaluating 12 selections for this target 
population. These analyses were based on knowledge of the TP and 
criteria developed for these evaluations. Ten literature 
recommendatior s were made based on these analyses. Of course, 
there are more than ten appropriate books. It is my hope that 
teachers and librarians will use the suggested criteria to 
identify these books and to share theivi with these students. 

In conclusion, certain criteria were critical in evaluating 
the success of the literature selections, most of which were 
picture booir.s , The most important was the ability of the 
illustrations to clearly explain the text and to capture its 
spirit. The second most important was the maturity of the theme 
matched with the age appropriate protagonists. And the third 
most important was the language structures and sentence patterns. 

AS a language teacher I was surprised to discover that 
language was not the most important criteria in determining a 
book's appropriateness for the ESL population. Upon reflection, 
I realized that as teachers we can simplify a difficult structure 
or even retell an entire story, if necessary, but we cannot 
create the visual explanation. For this, the illustrations are 
critical for those under our care who may not yet fully 
understand what the words mean.
