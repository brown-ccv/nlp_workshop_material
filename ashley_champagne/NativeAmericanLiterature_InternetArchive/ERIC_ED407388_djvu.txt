ABSTRACT 



People of all ages are addressed in this bibliography of 
multicultural literature. It focuses on four major ethnic groups: African 
Americans, Asian Americans, Latino Americans, and Native Americans. Within 
each category a distinction is made between those works with an authentic 
voice and those with a realistic voice. An authentic voice is an author or 
illustrator who is from the particular ethnic group and brings expertise and 
life experience to his/her writings or illustrations. A realistic voice is 
that of an author or illustrator whose work is from outside that experience, 
but with valuable observations. An asterisk notes the distinction. No 
distinction is drawn between juvenile literature and adult literature. The 
decision is left to the reader to make the choices, because some adult 
literature may contain selections appropriate to children. Two appendices 
provide: a selected annotated bibliography (14 entries) on 

multiethnic/multicultural literature references and analyses and sources of 
multiethnic/multicultural books. (SPM)

Introduction 



Compiling a bibliography for others is an idiosyncratic, yet, well meaning 
practice. Such is the case for this effort and here are the reasons. 

1. This bibliography focuses on four major ethnic groups: African 
Americans, Asian Americans, Latino Americans and Native Americans. 

This is done with the understanding that none of these groups are monolithic 
and each group has an infinite range of diversity. This bibliographical effort is 
respectful that the people within these groups have been inculcated with ethnic and 
cultural connections as well as with universal practices and patterns of behavior. 

2. This bibliography emphasizes authentic and realistic voices. 

Authentic voices are likened to diamonds because they provide genuine 
perspectives from individuals who have the expertise, life experiences and group 
identity membership to provide authentic realism to the words, tenets, accounts, and 
interpretations of the text they are creating. Within the parameters of authenticity there 
is diverse latitude of representative voices. Realistic voices are likened to zircons. 

They are the voices of keen observers whose discourse may be excellent or superb; 
their discourse, whatever the genre may appear real, and in some cases they may 
give brilliant presentations which outshine authentic voices. Nonetheless like a zircon, 
which looks and functions in many respects like a diamond, but is not a diamond , so 
are the cases of realistic accounts in both fiction and non fiction discourses. This 
resource presents authentic and realistic voices. The authentic works (authors and 
illustrators) are identified with an asterisk (*). Any errors noting authentic voices are 
unintentional and all attempts will be made to correct them in future editions. 

Avoided in this compilation were the detached observers, the authors, whose 
discourse echoed a non-vested interest. Unlike authentic and realistic voices, 
detached observers tend to view certain people, events, and activities as remote 
objects of the discourse rather than subjects within the genre. Any one or a 
combination of the following human constraints: ignorance, naivete, supremacy 
conditioning or privilege status enables such voices to marginalize - impersonalize - 
minimize information about the people, events, settings, themes, differentness, and 
historical connectedness so integral to any discourse. Certainly, point of view is a 
basic literary element. However, too often, many people become comfortable getting 
their understanding of others, who are culturally and ethnically unlike themselves, from 
secondary sources. They read, listen, and use descriptions provided by those whose 
observations, at best, provide a remote point of view. 



3. This bibliography supports a literary challenge that is never 
ending . . . never done .... 

The work of locating, creating, disseminating, and understanding multicultural / 
multiethnic literature is an ongoing process because such work cannot be definitive. 
This is how it must be, much to the chagrin of some and to the delight of others. 



4. This bibliography transcends age groups. 

It is easy to define young children as bigger than infants though not yet 
adolescents. It is also easy to define older children because no matter how old one 
becomes, he or she is always someone’s child. Because there are so many aspects of 
literature written for children that capture the sensibilities of adults, and, because 
literature written for adults often contains gems of wisdom and vignettes about life to 
be treasured by children, this source is for younger and older children. Rather than 
judge mentally what is chronologically suitable for a specific audience, that decision is 
left to the individual (which in many cases will be a teacher, librarian, parent, or other 
significant person in a young child’s life). Obviously there are portions and selections 
in books which are generally written for adults that are not suitable for children. 
However, within those very same books there are often passages and stories which 
can delight the hearts, challenge one’s own and others’ thoughts, align the past, 
explain the present, and predict the future of both the young, the old, and those who 
are somewhere in between. It is the individual who must decide how to allow 
literature, such as the selections included here, to nurture the hearts, inform the minds, 
and ignite the dreams of younger and older children.

*Books by Latinos about Latinos 
Books about Latinos 



Mindful of their unique cultural distinctions which become blurred 
and ignored by the term Hispanic, Latinos define themselves. 

They are Mexican-Americans and Chicanos, Puerto Ricans and 
Nuyoricans, Cubans, Dominicans, Guatematecos, Chileans, 
Venezuelans and others. They are the sons and daughters who 
have come from the more than twenty Spanish speaking countries 
and United States’ territories in the Western hemisphere and they 
are the descendants of those sons and daughters.

The African-American Experience. (1993). Orlando, FI: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Inc. 

(This guide supports infusing multicultural literacy into the classroom curriculum. The three 
distinct bibliographies are: (1) books for parents and teachers, (2) resources in 
multicultural education, and (3) award winning and notable books for children. The 
indexes are of authors and illustrators, and titles.)

children’s literature.) 

Edmonds, L. (1 986). The treatment of race in picture books for young children. Book Research 
Quarterly. 2 (3) 30-41 

(This article deals with how minortity and majority characters are portrayed in children’s 
books. Although the publishing trend of the 1960s and 1970s slightly increased the 
number of books featuring minority charcters, during the 1 980s there was a marked 
decrease. The author concludes by challenging mainstream publishers to present 
pluralistic images to young children.) 

Fox, N. (1 993). Politics and literature: Chasing the “isms” from children’s books. The Reading 
Teacher, 46, (8), 654-658. 

(Fox confronts her white identity to illustrate how her childhood and adult encounters with 
text reflect politics, values and supremacy propaganda.)

Newbery medal books from a multicultural perspective. The Reading Teacher, 48, (1 ), 40-50. 

(An investigation of 73 Newbery Medal books (1 922-1994) to identify ethnicity of 
characters revealed that White Anglo-Saxons are main, minor, or mentioned characters in 
90% of the books. The authors discuss implications of their total findings and the use of 
the Newbery Award books in multicultural literature programs.) 

Ham's, V. J. (1993). Teaching multicultural literature in grades K-8. Norwood, MA: Christopher- 
Gordon Publishers, Inc. 

(Harris provides lists of titles along with culturally responsive classroom strategies for 
using multicultural literature across the curriculum.) 

Hirschfelder, A. B. & M. Kreipe de Montano. (1 993). The Native American almanac: A portrait of 
native America today. New York: Prentice Hall. 

(This source emphasizes Native American experiences, achievements and points of 
view. The significant contents for this portrait discuss: the historical relationships between 
Native Americans and Whites in the U. S., Native Americans today, Supreme Court 
decisions, the Bureau of Indian Affairs and health services, tribal governments, languages, 
education, religion, games and sports, film and video arts employment, and military 
service.)

selection guidelines, and activities.)

1 967, and a literary renaissance beginning 1 968 to the present.) 

Sawyer, W. E. & Comer, D. E. (1996, 1991). Growing up with literature. Second edition. 

Albany, NY: Delmar Publishers. 

(The extensive collection of book titles and numerous hands on activities 
makes this reference a good one for early childhood educational programs. The 
thematic integrated approaches to using literature enhance the range of possibilities for 
children to have experiences with books.) 

Sims. R. (1982). Shadow & substance: Afro-American experience in contemporary children’s 
fiction: Urbana, IL: National Council of teachers of English. 

(Sims’ literacy analysis categories: social conscience, melting pot and 
culturally conscience retain relevance for readers seeking to understand about story 
characters and events as object of another’s thoughts and observations compared to 
characters and events perceived as subjects of one’s thoughts and observations.) 

Sullivan, Charles. (Ed.) (1 994). Here is my kingdom: Hispanic-American literature and art for 
young people. New York: Harry Abrams, Incorporated- A Times Mirror Company. 

(Louis Cancel’s forward to these collective works states, ”... that you are only skimming 
the surface of a rich literary and historical tradition ...” of the thousands of other Latino 
artists whose visions await discovery. He reminds readers to not be confused by the 
“manageable” Hispanic label because Latinos see each other as Puerto Rican, Cubans, 
Mexican Americans, Nuyoricans, Chicanos. Guatematecos, to name a few. Many diverse 
cultural groups reflect the Latinos in the United States.) 

Zarrillo, James (1 994). Multicultural literature, multicultural teaching : Units for the elementary 
grades. Orlando, FL: Harcourt Brace College Publishers. 

( Zarillo’s book lists tend to promote majority authors who write about “other” ethnic / 
cultural characters, even though the book lists contain numerous authentic voices. The 
literature approach, in this otherwise practical resource, emphasizes author, genre, 
thematic, and cross curricular units.)
