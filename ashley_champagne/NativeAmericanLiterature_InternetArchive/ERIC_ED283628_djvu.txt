Causes of Poor Achievement 

If teachers are to be respieted by their students; they must 
first demonstrate their irespect fbr the children and their culture.

Dhce teachers know and understand the children's culture weli 
enimgh tb accept it as equaUy good and equ^y valid, then 
neither teachers nor. Children will be pressured to adopt the 
otter's- ^it^. Instead, they will develop mutual respect and 
understanding. -- ----- -- - -- _ 

This ne^ for mutual respect seems obvious; yet, it isj^araini^c^ 
tual practice. Throughout the world, wherever native p^pleMve 
become a minority, they have found themselves under great 
pressure to adopt the culture,: values, and way of life of the domi- 
nantsociety. In most cases there has been very little respect for 
the^ibfes andATcUues of the native culture. Nowhere is this more 
e^ent tton m^achobls; In the classrobm, Ihe Native ciUtureis 
seldom^ used^ valu^ or-eyeii understood. But there are sigmfi*

Tea^^'s laek of underataiiding

culture, or does not understand how to adapt instruction to their

In reality Native Americans have tto-£buHe_a^^ 
knowing and living in two cultures. Teaches, onibsiDt&Br^mdt 
liiay know only one ciUture, and inay have accepted that culture 
as being superior without any rell thought or study. Teachers,

students are^ta^disadvcmtaj^ in the class.

Observant and creative teachers will find many vrays of inc(u> 
tK>rating information about traditional customs and values into 
dassrddm instruction, teaching students to think for themselves, 
to kiibw the alternatives, and to make their own choices.

Teachers were required t& produce many of their j)wn materials 
to teach in Navajo. Bernard Spdlsky found in 1973 a -'go^ bit" 
of Navajo language matenaljirbund, but libt enough '' to fill out a 
first grade year of reading" (Spblsky, 1973, p. 31). Although there 
is how considerably more material, most schools also re^^^ oh 
student-made materials. C6hsidenhgLthaLthe_Navajb_ai^by_ far

T%e_naturaL approach to Igt^iage acquiiitioii 

- Lmguists Jisd iducatdra witr^against a translatidiLapprdach 
to teaching any language (Krasfaen & T^^ 1983; Jbei^^ 1982, p 
20). krashen and Terrell (1983) have developed what they odl 




••The Natural Approach" to learaing langoa^s. - --- -- 

The first iMinciple of this approach is that ••comprehension 
precedes prbductibh." This implies, 

1. The instructor always uses the target Icmguage (the 
language to learned) i vj^zzz 

2. The focus of the communication is on a topic of interest to 
tli student 

3. The instmctbr strives at all times to help the student 
understand (p. 20) 

_ The second principle is that language production, whether oral 
or sAtten^is aUbwed to emerge in stages« first Iqr nonverb&i com- 
mumditi6n; s«»ndJSy single words such as yes or noj third by 
combiimtions^f two 6i t^e words, fourth by phrases^ fifth by 
sentences, and Jnaily :by_ md^ xiampl^ discbiirsB, In the ^igiu- 
mng students use a lot of ^o^^t^immi^^d p^ 
krashen and Terrell emphasSe la tt^ ^^dd that "the 
students are not forced to speak before they are mw^'- and that 
••speech errbrs which do not interfere with conmiunication ere hot 
corr^tewi^ Jp, 20). _ . 

__The jJ&i prindple is that the goal of language acquisition is 
commuScatioh^ £ach classroom activity : br lessbh isjirganized 
around a topic rath^thaS^a ^ammadcal structure. Topics can 
include field trips students are ti Kng ^i^sardbm sdehce ac- 
tivities students are doing, or games students ^ P^^^^^^^ 
language to be learned, such as^ ••Red Rover.''_Btudents 5^ to 
db more than jtist talk about a t^ic; they need to participate in 
as well as talk about activities. ••Young pec^le l^ra best from 
theiL own and not other people's experiences" (Cantieni & 
Tremh&y, £a?9, p;J4^^^ 

Krashen aniTerreflS &urth principle is that classroonLac- 
tivities must lower the ••affective filter of the students." This 
mrans that, 

Activities in ±he classroom focus at all times on tcjjics 
which^are mtei^stmg^di'devj^ and en- 

courage them to ^press tfaeEideas^ bpimoxis^jiesires, emo- 
tions and feeling^. An environment wU^ifiConductvB-to Ac- 
quisition must be create by the instructorrr-bw^mdety 
level, ^d rai^rt with the teacher, friradly natationsfadp 
with j>ther students---dtherwi^ acquisition will be impossi- 
ble. Such ah atmbsphere is hot a luxury but a necessity, (p 
21) 



It is easy lb see that the above pHnciples apply equally to 
teacHng a mative laii^age or English. By not focusing on 
vocabu&y; snc& aa^fimbming ife^namea and cbl- 

ors, or grammm*, studrats^c^mmla^gua^ sk99a^^ 
Only if students use the langu^ sUlk tfa«y acqm^^BJfa^

inside and outside of school where a student can use newly- 
acquired language skills. The home is an obvious place to use the 
native language, but some tribes have also starts radio and

Sinc& the goals of Induin education have been cliaiiged over the

educating Indians that were fiar away except by missionaries in< 
terested m what they saw aa their Gi^'si work to save souls. As it 
became apparent after the Gold Rush of 1849 and the building pf 
raih-oads into the west that cblbnizatdbn: wp^

make Indians co^orm to wUte waya o£ behaving, induding 
religion, dress, and homes. Schools and education were seen as 
ways of assimilating young Indians into the dominant society. 
Attendance was enforced, students ^^Bre not ^pwed to speak 



their tribal languageit aiid schools labeled tribal traditions as 
Venues cf prbgress. Had the goal bf assimilatibn been reachedi 
there would be no cultiiraUy-recbgnizable Indian people today.

But the goal has not been reached; ihstead^itiahy Indian children 
have not fdund success in schools which did^ not recognize their 
lahgua^s^hd cultures. Man older Indianahave workedagainat 
government- schools they saw as undermining their religion, 
herita^, and way of Bfe. ^ 

Besides making Indians ready for ' 'civilization, * * Indian educa- 
tion has also been a money*making business. In the late Nine- 
teenth Cenjtury corruption in the Bureau of Indian Affairs was 
ndtdripus. When Civil Service reforms brought corruption under 
cohtrol, rapid growth of the Indian educatibh bud^t s<^med to 
give the burraui^acy that adtmnistered it ^ life independent of

and other funding to replace the lack of property taxes from 
Indian trust land. ^ 

The failure of jnaiiy Iridiaii students to succeed in Bureau bfln- 
dian Affau-s (BIA) and pubUci schools over the years has led to 
many studies, includihg^ the Meri^^ andKehhedy Reports^ that 
asked why Jndian^tudenis J^ and writeas

for reformers wha used them to support passage of a variety of 
special prog^^s funded by the federal government. Some, such 
as Jolmson b'MaUey and Indian Education (Title IV), are for In- 
dian students pnly.X)thersindudmg Chapter 1, Bilingual (Title

The necessity for Indiaii eduratibn base^^ European 
model was dependent bh tbe s;^^ with which white settlement 
progressed ambi^ the tribes. King Gebi^ issued a ^byid pr^

^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^ between colomsts jind Inc&ui tnbes 
because of tfaeexpense of Indian wars and the desire to preserve a 
profitable trade in furs. However, many colonists ignored the 
royal restrictions* In fact, taxation of colonists to pay for Indian 
waif and for a atanding army to enforce the prdvisidnS:df the 
1763 pi-dclamatibn was a inajbi- cause bf the American Revolu- 
tion. :_ : 
I In 1 775 the Cbhtihcmtal Congress apprbpiiated $500 to educate 
Indians at_Dartmbutb;^f ter Jndependehce^ the bf 
the-^wJ^nited States-gave jriy Congresaifaepower taregulate 
comment with Indian ^bes ancL nrafce treaties. Congress ap- 
proved its first Indian treaty with the Delaware tribe in 1778. 
The 1789 ti^ty with the Oneida, Tuscarora, and St^bridge In- 
dians was the firat to contain education provisions (Rfpd/t, 1976, 
p. 63). During the next eighty-four yeu's,: the Seil^ approved 
atinbst 400 treaties bf which 120 had eduraUbnal prbyisibns. 
These treaties allbwed: fbr white settlement bn: lands. formerly

and increasing piBSS^ at^st^IndianTembvcB west of the 
Mississippi mid tfaen« wfa^ timt did not prove tfai j^rmanent 
solution it was first thought to be, for assimilating the Indian. 
Almost a billion acres of land were ceded to the United States in 
these treaties (/nduzn Bducatign, 1969, p. lU Report, 1976, p. 30). 
Article III bf the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 declared. 

The utmost good faith shall always be observed towards the 
Indians; their binds and property shaU never be taken from 
them without their consent; and in their property, rights, 
and liberty th^ never shall be invaded brjiisturbed, imle^^^ 
in just and lawful wars authbrized by Cbngress. (Vbgel, 
1972, p. 74) 

Many tr^ties had pfbvasibiis fbrgener|d edu^^tion,

tions reported in 1818: 

__In ihe presenLstate ci our countiy. jjne of tw

should be jnoralized or extermmated... Put into the hands of 
their chiidren the pruner and the hoor and they will natural- 
ly, in time, take hold of the plow... (Rdessel, 1962, p. 4) 

The next year Congress established a civilization fund, which 
lasted until 1873, Ui provide financial support to religious groups 
and others willing to live among and teach Indians. 

A combination of greed for Indian landaand the fidctidn which 
^metimes resulted from close Indian-white contacts 1^ to the 
development of a pbliQr of removal of tribes fioni clc^ contact

Eastern^ Tnbea such iis the Cherokee west of ihe Mississippi in 
1830 the Indian Removal Act was passed authorizing I^sident 
Jackson to exchange lands in the West for Indian lands in the 
Eastern States. In Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, Chief Justice 
John Marshal (pinioned, 

Thou^ the Indians are acknowledged to have an unques- 
tionable, and, heretofore, unquestioned right to the lands 
they occupy, until that right shall be extinguished by a 
vdluntaiy cession to bur gpyenimehtj yet it may well be 
dcHibted whether those tribes which reside within tbe 
acknowled^ boundaries of the United Sta^ can, j^th 
strict accuracy, be denominated foreign nations: They may,

title independent of their will, wUch must take effect in

Meanwhile they are in a state of pupilage. Their relation to 
the Unit^ States resembles that of a ward to his guardian. 
(Vbgel, 1972, p. 117) 

The next year in W^orcesJer i;. Georgia, the Supreme Court 
struck dd^ an attempt by Georgia to keep_imssibna^ 
white friends ^ff the Cherokee Nation. Again, Chief Justice John 
Marshall held, 

the treaties and laws o£ the United States contemplate 
the Indian teititoiy as completely 8^>arated from that of 
the states; and provide that all intereourse with them shall 
be carried on exclusively by the {^vemment of the Unioit

The Indian nations had always t^ii cbnsictered: as

them to Indians as we have applied them to the other na- 
tions of the earth. They are applied to all in the same sense. 
(Vdgel, 1972, p. 130) 

However, President Ja^son supported the state of GeorgUu's ef^ 
fort to keep missionaries and white ftiendsoff Cherok^ land and 
to force the Indians' removal west of the Mississippi. He is 
reported to have reipLrked: '-John has made his deci- 

sion, now let him enft>rce it" iVdgel, 19:72^:p. 124).

President Grant's Peace Commission of Eastern 
''humanitarians'* reported in 1869 that: 

_ The histoiy_of-the jBii^SrnS^ In-

with the Indians is a sickening record of murder, outrage,

and bccasioiud_ savage but^^ tinslM^akably bar- 

barous deeds of retaliation by the latter, as the exception. 
(Jackson, 1886, p. 339) 

Civil Service reform filially ended the worst forms of corruption. 
Increasing amounts of law in the west decreased the worst in- 
justices towards Indians, including murder. (It is interesting to

With the repeal of the Civilkation Fund in 1873, the federal

The firstdS^senrjtion indiaiLBoa^ School was opened at 
Carlisie, PenrayJvaniar in 1879, under the directorship of Captain 
RichanlJiemy Pratt. Pratt saw the purpose of bearding schools 
for Indians ^s to take the '/Indian'' out of his Indian students. 
Haskeil Institute was established m 1884 at Lawrence, Kansas. 
Over ths years Haskell has been changed from a manual training 
school to its^reseht ^tat^s as a Junior College, although stifl

In 1886, Indian men were ordered to cut thl^r hair short. A situa-

continue to this day. 

Education in white ways was si^n as a way to end this growing 
dependency aiid: ta destroy traditiblnal Indian tribal life; Another

By 1887, Congress was approprmtiag^ jn<M»-than i nulMbn 
dollars a year to educate Indians. About half the appropmUbns 
went to missionaries contracted to educate indians^'-Howeveri

However, as the gbv^mment'ae^^ 
to "de-Indianize" the Indian beciSa^standaiSj^^ 
schools a countervailing trend was starting in the country: 

the old view that ind^ ^fl^ure^Jiad nothing to offer 
American society, that the soouot they wm^jiMtrayed^^^^ 
replaced the better, gave way little by JBttietaxra^inteiestin 
Indian ways and then to a positive appreciation of Indian 
art and bther cbhtributibiis (Prucha« 1985, n. 58). 

This change in attitude was due, in part, to a iew sae^n^^ 
buUbok that went beyond the ethnocentric view that oudtures 
wefeinferibr to the dbminant culture and, in part, to books like 
Heien Huht Jaacsbh's A Century of Dishonor U^6j which

The typical reservation school of the termination era, Bureau-,

The situation almost appears colonial, x}t at the least caste-

The consequence jbl this b^ner {between the. school Jth^

children have begun to develop a closid and soUdary peer 
society within the walls of the school. (1971, p. 83)

S^*eateein is a key 

A child mth self-esteem likes himself. He has a good feeling 
about his own pez^ohal worth. As John Bryjie testified Before 
the Senate Subcommittee oh Indian Education, 

Practically all jMlucatprs will agree that> basically, the 
overall |Hinx>se<)f education is to turn but happy and sociat 
ly cbntributing human beih^. Thia means that as a^resultof 
his ^ucatibh, the studejit f^ls thatheJsjm i^p o^ 
\rii^iimeht^ is_a2htnl^^ id Jts developmrai, and has a 
joyful-sehse 6i acBevem^ according to his abUity. This is 
just anotter way of saying that school has met his needs. 
(1969, pp. 27-28) 

Robert Ro^sel made the folldwing observations concerning In* 
liah chfldf eh: 

It is imiK>rtaht for a teacher or ah admihistraiorJbd fchow 
how a child ^els about himself^ about his ischdbt.ahd-ahQUt 
his firi€»kls. The w^a child fefaLCoiore^a g^ptdacfa^td fife. 
Gdhfidence and happiness bring^an interest td learning, 
fi^e msacurity^ rejection^ or afieiing of inad^uacy may 
bring hostility or withdrawal (1962, p. 43) 

Children attiuh &^-estc^m m iwd jeayi .Qae ia thrdu^ 
i'reflcK^t^^praisals^'l th^ ideas, df what dtto-sutfaink of them; 
thdr cmx<^pt&Jof tfaeop^onaof Mends^^ teachers, 
and other individuals significant to them. What concept <>f 
themselves will Indian students have when they reflect the 
teacher's opinions? 

The second way students gain ppmidns of: themselyes is 
through their pen^tiphs of how well th^ fulfill persbhal staxL- 
dards th^ Imve develbped for them^ the& 
abilities^ their statnsu their rdles,^ and cdmpare them wi^ what 
th^^dvdd Idee id becdm& ll&tey alsd cdm^re their achievement 
of then* dbji^ives with how well others appear to have achieved 
those same objectives. 

Tochers of Indian students cannot assume that the per spnal 
standards upon which studenta will judge themselves will be 
similar to the teacher's standards, or to the bbjectives bf urban 
society.

tend ta iearn as little— or as much— as their teachers expect. 
(1986; p: 32) 

- Teachers should learn as much as possible about the good 
qualities of their students and of their students* cultures so that 
sincere ptBise will become natural aiid students will ^1 more 
confident. Indian students are often more skilled in rMding faces 
and actions than in^ interpreting verbal statements. They quickly 
detect sugar^rbated^ insincere priiise. Teachers must J66kJB3ir and 
see students' actual strengths and then give true appreciation 

and encouragement; 

studmts whose^exp^tations are largely of failure and rejec^ 
tion^ the smallest; almost insignificant, signs of capability should 
be identified. 

Praise for a job well ddiie should be given imm^ately, since 
praise given iii the afl^rabdh for what a student did in the morn- 
ing is of little value. Praise should also be given unobtrusively^ 
since public praise can be humiliating for ah Indian Jtxident_and 
can cause other stiidenta tojreact negatively. Tamany students, 
approval from friends and peers is far more important than ap- 
proval from a teacher. 

Recognizing 8tudents\ strengths 

If students are^ tQ_J)efieve in themselves,, teachers must 
rjecognizeinSviduai strengths. AU-children have strengths. It is 
up to teachers to Snd them; to let students know about them and, 
then; ta use those stri»?>gths to help students learn. 

One teacher, ta heip her second grader a see their owii 
strengths, had each write a statement begihhihg with, ''I like 
myself b^use..,'V:Tkt^statements she got were simple but 
revealing and hel^l her fihd^good things to emphasize. A typical 
statement was, **I like myself b(^use_rmAa 
ride aJjicycle; andi iake^^kid care oLmy teet£''_0ne ve^-^ted 
student irLthe class completely outsfiown ^e other students. The 
teachu^ was anxious to see what kind o| a list she would make. 
Her answer was short and instructive for the tocher who was 
just learning about Indian culture: ''I like myself because I know 
how to make friends.'' 

Mdtiyatiiig through reaUs Btudeiit developed goals 

When people want something, they will work for it. The want 
precedes the achievement. Most middle class urban students are

highly motivated towards success. Th^ are willing^ to work 
whether it is pleas4nt or hot and whether the rewards of the work 
willJbe sodh br. delayed. They are accustomed to ah autocratic

and definition of /-Suc^s.'-V-^ zn^:: n ^zjn hhlz zzzz zz 

Many Indian students define success in ways unrdated to 
school. Their only objective in school is to get through it— to en- 
dure it. If they are aware of any goals in our classrooms, it is 
because teachers have set goals and: told zStud^ about them. 
Those gc?ls are hot studehts' goals. But, if Ihdiah stiidehts have 
no personal goals that involve schbbl^ th^ then have Uttle r^sbh

can succeed, studehts will ready to sit down and discuss where

The goal is not a piece of candy or time out from work. The "^oal 
is to be able to do somethihg students a>uld not do before. Of

Deyeiopmg seU-respect^ 

A t«icher*s attitude? toward students, as mlrron>d in student's 
thinking, can build the; self •resj>ect necessary to ^ happy life and 
to success in school diily if students are respected. Students niust 
live ill a warm and supjK^rtive school atmosphere where each 
child is recognized, by himself and others, as a worthy individual 
who is: wanted, respited, and liked. 

A calm atmoBphere in which^BtudentsiU'e respected will also do

aiid wbo can show them that they are respected for what they are 
id ^eii on the road to j^^ ving those children sucosss in school. 

Students need more tlmn Just self-respect. They ^eed seif^ 
esteem. They need something they can be proud of. Too many 
teachers and other well-ihtehtiohed individuals : look at the

they need something to be proud of. Pity and pride do not go 
t^ogether. Building sympathy for a group of people may be a good 
way to raise money for a mission or a schol 1, but it has no place in 
the work within the school or mission. Chief Dan George express- 
ed the idea well: 

Do you know what it is like to feel you are of no value to 
society and those around you? To know that people came to 
help y oil but not to work with you, for you kiibw they knew

The tiiost important arid: lasting way to improve ifieir^scliool

skills. ChUdreh who can road and WTite Jitell and who can solve 
math and science prbblema^eldom self-esteem. This is 
especially true it students can Mso use their knowledge to help 
other students acKeve^iane, a shy and sensitive Iri<yari girl oh

proved through computer instructidii, she progressed socially as

student how to use the computer, which is wonderful for 
self^steem. (Clark, 1985) 

For students to achieve, teachers must build on the fouhdatibh 
of their current level of achievement. If grade-level textbooks 
presuppose a jugher level of achievement than students have, 
then t^cfers must adapt lessons to take the gap between actual 
and^pected achievement into account or the students will be 
leftbettnd and their feelings of failure will increase. TJSoughout

Students will be afraid to make decisions until they trust their 
teachers,: and Indian students will hesitate to trust their teachers 
until their teachers trust them. 

Teaehing decisidti-inakiiig skills 

Before Indian students can build self-esteem by knowing they 
are trusted to make decisions for themselves, teachers will have 
to teach them d^isidn-making skills, to give them a relaxed 
classroom atmosphere in which ho students are afraid to express 
tfaeS ideas so tSatlhere Jsiree auddbpeh cbmmuhicatibh between 
teachers and students. and to give thein bpiF^rtuhities to m

better decisions during the rest of their lives jEriandsoii, 1985).

must be respected with no preference for the response of one child 
over another. iStudeiits may have to leam to distinguish between 
constructive criticism aiid ridicule before, they, too, can en- 
courage evetybhe's participatibh. The teacher can aid the discus- 



sion with questions such as: '\How would tikis e^ect your 
family?" **Can you »ee why other pec^le nught feel differently?" 
and "Are you sarong this because you think that is what I want 
to hear?" Aft«r these discussions are famiiier to students^ th^

Practice witfi ^ns 

In the section oh ''Exposure to Different Reading Strategies,'* 
a suggeitidiLwas made to let studehtsj>ractice using stratef 'es 
witfi non-print mai^ncdis^ as filmsv One sixth grade teacher of 
Northern eheyemes did just that. She had a video tape of a 
movie about Chief iiseph^ IK// FigMNoMofe Fo^ver, and us- 
ed some ''active partidpationV' tecteiqSea 
While studenta watched the movie, the teacher stop^itte videS 
tap^ penpdieally. During the first pause, the dass was asked to 
tell what had h8f ^3hed up to that point. An unportant character 
in the film was sefeted by the teacher, aiid the students were 
asked to come up with a list of everything thj^ could romember 
or guess jibout this person. This list was: wntten on the boarx^v 
The class was isked tc^choGse 1^ the list they 

thought wooldbe most importfiSt^ and w^, The_clas8 

was then asked to guess what would faai>pen ji^tj^ 
These predictions were also written on the board and later con- 
firmed or r^ec^ed. 

A vanatiph of the above was refj^ted every time the video tape 
was stopped. Stud^i • iMde preuictions about what would ocoir 
b;^sed on *'clues" from the filSi a?>d their own ^owledge of Chief 
Joseph. At the end of the movie the teacher held a short class 
SsSir : _a_ui-hciw the students bad used what they

Afterwards, 'vitl^ar^^iding asaigmgmt»^therlas8 was 'ed 
of what they haddoni^ while watching the movie tck^ x 
were going to do the same thing while reading. The advmtage of 
using ndn-priiit inat^erials is that children can be introduced to 
and practice tising strategies with materials which are easier for 
them to process.

TMs strategy involves students and teachers ^ddng tu.^ns asking

A fifth grade teacher of the Northern Cheyenne used this 
technique stucces^sfuUy^ i^ class. A textbook 

passage dealt with the geography and people of Peru. The teacher

the teacfa^ closed her book and asked for questions about what 
had been read. She tri^ to answer all questions honestly. After 
the questions stopped, the teacher asked students questions over 
the first paragraph. This helped assure that important facts were 
btmlght to the students' attehtip : j: : 

This prcKress was repeated with the hext para^^^ viph, Wheh tiie

w£at_she thought the answer might be and how she had reachc^i 
that conclusion, '*! have to guess '^ 'ricr the book does not tell me

In follow up lessons after students berame more proficient at

(Would you believe that some students read mon? than the

maiL** 

Ahbther authbr uses this cbhversatibh, 

"This really is a piece of our American life, right among 
the Indians, You wait and sec, some day they'll be real fine 
Ameriran citizens." :

the American Indian, banning. 

There ^re sa^ige Indian trilMis that hunted the buffido

provide a 

rigorous undergraduate curriculum that embraces ^ com-

As \nth all good literature, the best Native American literature 
strikes at the heart of essential truths and how th^ are derived

the expression of the universid artist engag^ig tfa&world around 
him or her: the voices! W.B. Yeats, Wiiiiam Faulkner, Frank 
Kawabata, Ovdd, Scott Momaday, Simon Ortiz, or Leslie SUko. 
The persdnai nature comes from a characteristicaUy intense par- 
ticipation of the individual with the wholeness of the surroun- 
dings, or the fragmenting &ilure to find such a wholeness. The 
Native Amencan voice speaks from its own world in America and 
from tl^ unique position of beii^ native to the land^ evc^ while 
sometimes, separated from it by the dominant, white, modem 
American society; .. — 

The voice ev^ces the presence pf "Wtat Moves-n^oves" 
described by Kenneth Ijincoln in the introduction to Native 
Amencan Renatssance. In spite of the rich, varied texture of In- 
dian literature, this -'conception of the human voice invdking 
power** (Lincoln, p. 2) is nptpnly paiv-Indiaiii as Lincoln wcmld 
have iti it is pan-hiiman. To lead students into the universality 
ahu uniqu^ess of Native American Uteratjore^ a teachc^ must 
recx^nize the essential tziitbB l^lized in the^ of ex- 

istence, whether given in biography or in a hig^y fanciful poem 
or story. - -^ -^ ^^^ -^ ^ - -^ i - 

Ralph Waldo Emerson writes in (Hrcies, "Our life is an appren- 
ticeship to the truth that arotmd every circle anoth^ be 
drawn; that thco^ is no end in nature, but every end is a beg^mi- 
iiig** (p. 263). That idea is exemplified in much Native Ammcan 
literature. Einersbil adds. 

The life of man is a seif-^votving circle, whichr from a ring 
impeit:ep'iibly small, nas all sides dutwanis td new 

imd larger circles, and that without end. The extent td which 
this generation of circ^, wheel without wheels will 
depends oh the force of truth of the individual souL (pp. 
264-6&). - - ' -

we ixiust not think the past exists m present iitemture only in 
dir^t bbitbwm^. The teacher of Native Ameri(^n Uterature 
must cohstahtly be aware of two worlds: theiancient tribal world 
and today's ti^hncflogica^ world. Many conflicts and the resolu- 
tions of those conflicts in the literature generate from the ten- 
sions betwe^ those J;n^ worlds^ wh short

One of the best tCK)ls for unlbcking the ^cient tribal vilues and

The core of Barfield's argument in^umg the Appeamnces Usa 
in two closely related concepts. First, the difference between the 
tribal <>utlddk toward nature and the ''modcdii technological'' 
piltlddk is more than merely a d^^rence in tjlinking about 
phenomena (which he lab^ alpha thinking^ it is also a difference 
in figuration, the process by which the zmnd constructs

berau»e^ we experience not with i>ur impartial senses idone-but 
with other things such as "mental habits, memory, imagnationt

dependentiy of our participation. This path toward nonparticipa- 
tion, toward isolation, in the Euro-American world leads from the 
emergence of Greek reflective thought and: thejlirect and pur* 
pdseftil i^ectioii of paiticij)atibn in andent Israel, to the modern

The Whole Languaie 
Approach to Language Arts 
for the Indian Stuient 



The communication skills of listening, spea^g, lading, aiid 
writing are learned best together as^ for example, reading can 1^ 
learned from miting and writing from reading. Thiis^ all: com- 
muhicatibiL skills should be ccanbii^ in a teacbing approach call-

language practice, the use of culturally rdevant materials, and 
language experience activities. The principles of the whole 
language approach are: 

1. Much of the content of instruction comes from the student's 
own laiiguage and expmence. : : 

2. Aspects of language are learned &bm language

4. Cdmmunicatibn smis are hot taught in isolation. Students 
learn to read: from writing, and vice. verafiL. K'^grams should, 
therefore, include reading, writing, speaking, and Ustemng ac- 
tivities. _ 

^ ^ ^^^5^^^^^^ ^^^1^7 appreciate the written 
works of otli^s, including Indian and non-Indian literature. 
Whole language programs usually include: 

1. Writing language experience stories. 

2. Bringing familiar la^ to the classroom (words from kid 
culture, teleyisidii, racUp^ soh^, sports,: and so forth). : 

3. Readmg strat^r instructibh (decoding, cbmprehehdihg, and 
criti<^ thinking activities). 

4. Reading td Btudehta^ 

5. Having stndentaread to themselves for enjoyment. 

6. Shamig ^ Bt^ture. 

7. Having students write every day. 

8. Practicing oral language. 

Whole language programs include units which incpifNDrate 
lading jsee chapter on reading cbmprehensibn)^ listening, speak- 
ings and writing. The: various cbmpbhehts bf a whble language 
program are described below foUbwed by a sample unit. 

Ldateiiiiig 

: Listening is an impbrtant language arts ^kilL::It:is estimated 
that people spend fbrty-fiye percent bf their dculy language-use 
time in sbmiB listening activity. Lis tcaiihg is esipecially imypbrtant 
&ir Jndian^students who need id ^pancL their. ^^ocabu&oies.to 
e^n -Conxmand oL words they may want to use in speaking, 
reading, and writing. 

In a whole langua^ program, students practice listening when 
they are read to, a regular activity of the approach. They practice 
listening as th^ Igar other students contribute to language ex- 
perience stories. Th^ practice listening as th^ hear otter 
students brir^ familiar wbr^ for word lists fiihd as they hear 

bther-Students s&tre literature 

In addition, other x>pportunities must be made for fistening 
practice. Early primary students should have practice in just 
listening to and identifying sounds and their features. Primary 
students must have practice m listening to directions, recogniz- 
ing rhyme, list^Eiing fbr sbtinds in wbrds^ listening fbr meanii^ 
bf words, and Ustemng fbr main ideas* sequence, and details. 
Rules for good listening must be stressed.

Ill intermediate and upper grades, tbs same k&da^Jistemng 
practice ^eed to take place; and« in addition* stadents need to 
practice listening to Ainderstand and ieam, listening for pleasure, 
and listening ciitically. Specific activities must be planned with 
these^u^se^iaimiid. TheTO are ils^ purposes iter readily, 
and&atmction in reading wd wn^ for each puippse can be 
correlated. Howevj^ it Js isMntii that. listening not be 
neglected. For Indian students, especially, more time must be 
devoted to it. 

Speaking 

S])eaking, like listeningr is noLgiveztenough^mphaais^in iiidat 
classrooms. One of three major reconmiendations to* ^^o^^^ 
language skilLi of Inchan students is to provide mo^ wel 
language practice for them. Indian students must spend more 
time mastering spoken language before they are expected to read 
ani write it.

languai^ experience story. For yoimg studente, tha teacher 
writes the stozy down on a chipboard or chart paper while older 
students can db th&yF own writing. ^)raking is practiced when 
students bring familiar language to the classroom to suggest 
words or phrases to make: liste of spbrts_ terms* iiames of 
tdbtl^^&stes, or words with the same leaning such as awesome, 
humungous^ and other 8^ When studente share

amples of Indian oratory see Virginia Armstrong's / fiave

made an mpdrtant s^ for Indian students.

language through immersion. 

Writing ^ ^ ^ -_ ^ 

Students should write every day. Writing should be made an 
impco-tant activity. Students should have writing folders or large 
envelopes in whidi to keep written work. Classroom rules shwld 
emphasize that it must be quiet when pec^ie are writing. The 
^'editihg'^[cdn^tmg) process must be madean imfK>itant ingi^

language experience stories^ and other short woi^s. It is best if 
they copy poems, son^, and stories with which they are already 
familiar. 

A s^iid form of controlled writing is to have students wiite 
word lists from jheir experiences and surrbiindings (not frcm a 
spellmg bobklj. For example, students can write names of thu^ 
in a-pictux^_br in JUieir clusrob^ buying, schobLyard^

ings discussed one at a time; ^r students can make tbeir own lists 
based oil the tc^ic aiid exchaiige theiii for cditectibn by their

peers. Tlie teacher should be on hand to explain and confirm spdl^

studenti can irate deacripti^ paragraphs of their classroom,

to do with other holidays or spe^^ys. They flso can dorhjonr 
ing words i^r the first word is given^ They coidd theajwrite 
ppetiy with the rh^ning words. Word lists can be done by groups 
of students or used by tutors with individual students. 

A third form of cohtrollMl vmting is the dictati<m of sentences

upon the^IeveLj)f the stud^^^ Sentences can include students*

answer questions such as: What is your name? What school do

A fifth form of controlled writing is to have students writes set 
number of sentences each week from spelling or vocabulary

and fewer errors. They Become ^nfident when they see they are 
eliminating errors. Students at higher grade levels will have more 
sentences to writ^. However, there should be few enough so the 
teacher can l(x>k them ovei* quickly, niaybe even correct th|^ in

&9ntrolled writing should be done as I(mg as needed^ the con- 
tent should depend upon the types of errors made by studente. 

Independent writing. In the second writing category, indepen^ 
dent writing, students are encouraged to put their thoughts and 
ideas on paper. Writing should be viewed as the ability to imte 
one's own ideas and preseht them in a form for others tpTOad« It 
should be str^s^ that one's own ideas are important. Ideas can

this kind of motivation to get anything written, leave out every 
fifth Wctd of a work so they can fill it in. 

Seleeting a topic 

Independent writing requires selection xyf topics. Selecttog 
topics is difficult for children at first, so. at first, teachera nay 
have to provide tii^ics £"0111 which sttidentis can chooi^. L&ter 
students should be encouraged to select their <}wh to|M^.-TJie 
topics, should relevant to the students' eaq>erieM«ffl, 
hffppeninp* in their lives^ or things they ^pw about. Sometimes 
teachers can provide thei>eginmngL6f Jn(U)xnpleie^entend^ or the 
ending of sentences ^ ^er to get sgjdmts sti^ai.- Hawei^ 
teachers and tutors should help students leom to sdect then- own 
t^ics. A teacher may show how he or sh^ selects topics. The 
teacher and studente need paper and pendL On one of the pieces 
of paper th^ number from 1 to 4. Behind numbers 1 and 2,

ihglish as a Second 
Language for the Indian 
Student 

Rachel Schaffer 



''The first people on this continent to be taught English as a Se- 
cond Language were probably the American Indians. " 

James E. Alatis, 1973, p. 41 

Teac&ing EngUsfa to students whose first language is not 
English involves different assumptions about language learning 
and student needs than does teaching English to native English 
speakers. The two ^dUps differ iii size of English ycR^bulary^ in 
famihanty with the prbnunciatibh and grammar rules of English^ 
and in knowledge of the finer p^^ speaking ahd writing 

EhgUsh, 5iicIi^^yJe_ahd_ tQnia. There wfll probably, also be 
citltural diflerences between native English and speakers to 
whom English is a second language which will affect how

One area of behavior that has a strong influence on the amount 
and nature of speech produced in the classraom is the use of 
silence. Silence among students ^in be used as weapon ^gainst

used methods of teacffin^jmd inte^tibn very difTerent from 
those used by members of the commuSty. In another class^ 
wl^ a teacher had ^^ter concern and respect for students' 
opinions, students talked freely. Obviously, in a language 
classroom, it is vitally impbrta^to encourage students to sp^k 
gng try to ezp^ss themselv^. Tlus can be done best by creating 
a suppbrtiv^ low-i^iciy-atmc^ recom-

Use a variety of teachiSg techniques 

Once teachers know something about their stud^te- culture, 
leaitdiig styles, aiid: language, th^ will have a better idea of the 
most effective teaching techniques. But every class and every 
studeht is differehU so usii^ a varie^: of methods: and ap- 
proaches will ensure that every studeht will get involved at some

time, and teachers will quickly develop a feeling for the most en- 
joyable and effective techniques. Teachers should feel free to ex* 
peiiment and to let students know they are trying something

Two ^jor areas of English that cause problems for seccmd- 
iangirage learrers are jdionis and word endings, especially ii^ec- 
tional (grammatical) endings. Idioms eyre difficult because th^ 
are essentially midti-wdrd vocabulary items: phrases of twabr 
more wdnls tbat have a ^bmpletily arbitral^ meaning: rather 
than the literal meaning found combining the meanings of 
each word in them. Thus, the idiom * 'you 're puffing ^m^^^ legj' has 
nothing whatSi:Hiver to with jpuUingie^ but; instead^ haaihe 
special icfio^tic meanfiS^ " You 'reJoftSg^' -Students; therefore; 
&ve to mensoraeaometimea very long strings of words with only 
one short, arbitrary meaning moreover, when they desire to use 
w idiom from their fb'st ianguajg^, they often will translate it 
2ite/tz2/y, word for word, into English. Since most languages have 
completoly different idioms for the same idea (wh^_ th^ Aai;^ 
idioms for the same ideas)^ the results may be unsatisfactory and 
frustrating (and frequently humorous, but at the speaker's ex- 

pehse);^ 

Idibms must therefore be taught iaihe^am^ way aa 
word v^cabuia^ itenoSf with teachers' ^ that aU 

words in the expressions go to make up one comipieteiy different 
meaning. Using vocabulary-building exercisf^s, working idioms 
into class and mfprmal discussions, and givir.^ examples of ap- 
prc^riate tise of idipms caii help students become familiar with 
tha mc^t common E 

Word ending in English also cause a great many problems for 
speakers of other languages because jodoiphblQgy jwhic^

part of ap^ch ofiLwxffd4pre% anv*ive;--ment^ to mention

iy, so that distinctions marked in English are not at all natural or 
intuitive to second langua^ learners and tne arrangement of 
word ^dings is straiigf for thetn. These endings therefore require

A second grammar-based method^ the audioUngmi approach^ 
was an application to language learning of beMuwHsm, a 
psychoiogicai approach to the sUidy of human behavior. 
Behayiorism says, in graeral, that behavior is the result of learn- 
ed habits reinfbn^ (through rewards or punishment) by the 
situation surrbuhdihg the learner. In applying^ this approach to 
language learnings teach€^&_p^ langtta^ ^bdel to 

students^a^iariicular grarnrn^ mie (sudi as 4ise of the plural 
nuti^er^) or .sentence stixtctiire (such as the passive construe- 
^6n)-^a^ had students practice that rule or structure through 
spoken or written drills until they had developed a new habit and 
could use the structures automatically. Teachers reinforp^ 
students through encouragement w cbitectibiL But, again^ 
cr^tiye language learning was limited.

student interested iu learning another language could memorize a 
dictionary and a^ammar book and get along splendidiy— an im- 
possible task, as the young adn of one of iny Hebrew prb^ssprs 
was bnce sadly disa^^inted to discover when he tried to db this 
with Hebrew. As Veit (1986) nicely plits it^: "Learning about 
grammar has about the same effect bh tbie ability to read and 
write as learning about leg muscles has on the ability to run*' (p. 
252). __ ___ __ _ _ _ _^ __ _ 

To linguists, who stody language as^ science, first language 
learning involves far more than a set of learned habits or a ^llec- ' 
tion of technical terms: there is an active, creative process going 
on as languagB learners construct rules uncbi^cibusly firdtn the 
language he^diarpund them. Cbmmumcative-based approaches 
to teaching ESL therefore treat secbnd language learning more

An area of potential conflict in t^ching English to Indian 
children is the clash between learning styles to which students 
have been exposed at home and those used in the ESL classrobin.

: It was lid wonder^ theii^ that Philips bbierved differences ih the 
h(ehavior^f Inifian aad^iro^Jndiah^atudents in a vanety^ sc&qqI 
situations. In^ajstudentSr Con^co'^^^^ non-Indian students, 
appeared reluctant to answer questions when called on, to 
voluntecs- information, or to t^e on leadership roles in small 
group exercises, behavior which could be iiiteipreted as shyness, 
unresponsiveness,^ bdi-e^^ or suUenness by teachers unfaiti^ar 
with students' cultural backgrounds. Oh the other hahd^ Indian 
students were more cooperative and active than hoh-Indiah 
students in small grbupa.where they. cfirected th&^tivJties 
themsdves. Thus^ JPhSips says, *-.-.the differences in readtness to 
participate in interaction are related to the way in which the in- 
toraction is ors^nized and controlted" (p. 3^79|f. 

Another approach ta learning styles has dealt with cultural dif- 
ferences in the emphasisj)laced oil certain skiUs or approaches to 
analyzing: information. The European educational tradition, on 
which mmhstrram American educatibiL is models, values bbjec- 
tive;_ scientific^ apprbacliea^ ^eaHty^ in particulu^ v^bd akil^ 
mat£^an(Lsymbbl^aidpii&tibn.JM[a^ Native i^encan Cultures 
plaice moreempfmsis on a subjective, artistic view of the woridin- 
terpreted through drawing and other \^sual and spatial skills. 
Headless of cultural background, children will have individual 
strengths aiid preferences for one approach dyer the bther^ sb it is 
impbrtaht that teachers try to discover students' strengths and 
weaknesses and present material in a variety bf ways^ usiiig a 
variety of aiidltbiy- visuait and tactile mbdes^ including spbken 
aiid wntten iangua^-Cwith freqnmt paraqphfasirig.oL ideas); 
visual aids such as pictures^ charts, and tables; ^nds-^n^ex- 
perience; and so forth. The greater the variety of waya used to 
present information, the greater the likeUhood students will 
receive a sufficient amount of ''comprehensible input." 

Mpre specific learning strategies address the academic heeds 
students will face. Cummins (1984) discusses the rbles bf context 
and cbgriitive ihvblvementin the cbmrnuhLcatibh tasks req

Steroer-Manzarares, et al., and Ozford-Car|^nt^r (1985) stress 
the importance of using any or all of these learning strategies for 
facilitating language leaitung. Oxford^aix^nter reports that 
researchers have found that "successfiil language learners tend 
to use 'gCKxi' strate^es: more often than unsuccessful language 
learners" (p. Ij, and Stewhei^Maii2anareai_e^ 
''staidents whb have a viui^ stotte^ea to apply to a 

wide rani^ of Jearning tasks^ cu^ far more fikely to be elective 
lah^a^ l^tmera!' (p;_i7j; Sime ''studies show that learning 
st^te^es--Cffia - be improved or modifi^ through training" 
(6xford-€arpenter, p. 1), ESL teachers should become familiar 
with the iiteratuns discussing the various t5^>es and offering sug- 
gestions on how to help students deS^lbp them. The advantage^ 
of course, is that not only will language learnings akiUs be 
shaxpened, but learning skills in a!l subjects wiU be improved.

capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society " 
(p. 1). Piirasihg this more generally. Vine Deloria, Jr. (1969)

style which a pec^le acted. It was self-expression, but 
hot a conscious self^pressidtt fUlther, it was an expression 
of the essence of a people, (p. 185) 

The culture concept was drawn from itaroot meaning of "cultivst 
tibn" as creation, as in the growth and development of 
domesticated plants aiid adnumjsds. As Laguna Pueblo poet Carol 
Lee Sancbez writes of Indian identity as creation:

AnbtBetapprbach is to discuss the influence of cultures on each 
other. Someyears agbi when I taughta course at ecdstgp,-Mon- 
tena, just north ^ the Nbrtherh Ch^enne ReservatMrn^the 
teachers asked me two apparently cbntradictory questions 
(though they did not ask tfiena on the same day): 1. How can there 
Ch^enne kids really be "indiant' They drive to high schwl in 
pickup trucks, wear blue jeans, and^p«at basketball fai|8- 2. 
Why are these Cheyenne kids so different feom bur white kids? 

Bhe^way bf answering the questions is to refer to Ralph 
Linton's (1936) descripUbn Of the typical day of the average 

American.

Notice how many references there are to American Indians in 
this passage. Malcolm McFee (1968) coined the t&rm "15Q%

I]^ause-they ifaould learn to live in the white man's world, and 
that ^faera was no nc^ for non-Indians to take such (purses 
because white people do not have to live on reservatidns. Earlier 
in this essuay thei^ was re^reiice to the Mdntana Indian studies 
law, which reqiiii^ teacbersit^ have background in Jhdiah 
history and culture. As might be expected, Uiei^ wis sbme ccm-

questions aboutwhatis Indian culture and heritage, how courses 
andjtrbrkahbps can present se^ accurate information on

Hispamc, cowboy, women's, or any other culture. There was the 
issue of whether teachers should required td take such educa- 
tional courses. The Mdntana Indian Staidies Law became so coh- 
troversial, in f|ct^ that pressure and Ibbl^ing l^r teachers and 
others led the Montana l^slatute to pass Hbuse BiU 219 ihl9ld 
which changed the ri^uirement _t^^ individual- school 

districts to j^uira back^bund & IndiraL itadies if they so 
desirad, rather than kequng it as a state requirement. 
- JtJs hxq^^taoi to remember that social studies issues are in-

Indians and nbn*Indiatis, often for different re^^i^s-^^s 
become quite seiisitive when Indian sUidents appreciate the in- 
formatibn or focus and non-Indians feel thiy are being attacked, 
or feel guilty iiind or vice versa. One of my students 

wroteJn evaluating me that ''the instructor is so sympathetic to 
indfiiadtum tSl he hates other aUtur^' '-^something that is 
not the case and which J certainly-had hot intended to c(mv^. 

Sensitive topics can beaRprd^hedihi vmet^ ex- 
ample, an overview of Plains Indian history can empfataize the 
brutality of warfare and the massive deaths which occuiraLm the 
smallpox epi(^mics which several times wiped out over half the 
pbpulktibn of the tribes. Of it can emphasize the constant 
heroism of individual and idtimate su^ of the grdupi and the 
cnsativity developed by the tribes in their cratmiild adaptation to 
newxohditibhs. Or^ there can be a bcdance in presenting both of 
these issues as-they relaie-tb ihdiah culture and histdiir. 

Several things to be considered when teachihg social studies 
related to Indians are: - -- -_ - - 

1. Indian viewpoints should be respected as alternative explana- 
tions to other hjrpqtheses mid opinions. 

2. Unsubstantiated theories need to be treated as such— as 
theories or hypothesis.

Teaching Science to the 
Native American Student 

CdHosJ. Ovando 



In 1976 the American AssocStton for the Ad^ 
Science (AAAS) prepared a document, V'Heconmehdatibns for 
the Imprbvemeht of Science and Mathematics for AmenciiL In- 
dian^/' Among the recpmmehdations were ij that hijg^ schcKd 
science t^achiers should use an ethhdscientific approach wWch 
draws upon the way aciientific principles are expressed in the 
Native Ameiicair culture; 2) thait biUhgual instruction should be 
used where loyalty to theJ^aUve^Smericaa U is fairly i?i- 

tehse; and 3) that a vigorous effortsJmSttJSe^ade to recriu 
Native Americah students for programs m_^dence_ jai^ 
techhblb^ (Green & Brown. 1976). These recommendatmns 
reflect three important issues of improveinent ^f science instrucr 
tion ior Native Americans addressed in this chapter. First, how 
can an effective hfittrice bt lichievM betw traditional, home- 
iearning experiences of atxidehts ande ibnnal Science aimcultun? 
Second, what should be the role^f tfe^hbmeJanguajge and/(H- 
E nglish language development in science. t^t^oS**™^ Third, 
what is the place of science teaching within the whole school cur- 
riculum for Native Americans?

of the foUbwing processes^ V'invi^tigaiin^ ex- 
l^rimentiiig^ bhsemngi^xlefimng, comparing, relating, inferring, 
clapsi^ing [anajirQSm 1977). Regardless of the 

level of ^enti& soplristicati^ humans all over the world, as 
theyJnto-act J¥ith their environment, have had to use these same 
processHSs to develop t^hnology which enables them to survive. 
As Cajete (1986) observes, 

„Expresai6naol the science thought process are abundant 
ia Bstonral-traditionai Native Americaii cultures. They 
have renged from the simple practical technologies 
developed to survive in a^ven environment to bi^y com- 
plex and elaborate technologies developed byihe^"hi^" 
milizatidiis of Mexico^ Central, ^and^ these 
expressions of the science thou^t process have ail token 
distmctive ctUtu^^ fcams wHch reflect primarily the way a 
partic^lar^^up of Native Americans has adapt^ to a par- 
ticulm^^lace and environment, the science thought process 
has bEMen refi«:ted in Native American agriculture, medical 
practices, astronomy, art, ecological practices, hunting, and 
gathering, (p. 4) 

_ Actrntfies, ihen, that can be applied to formal science learning 
in school are an as integral an aspect of Native American cultures 
as they are of all cultures. Thefeiprg, all children bring to schdoLa 
base for scientific knowledgli skills, and expediences^ llusJ^se 
can be related to the school Vs cmrricu^^ 
American chUdreh may have had^st-hand experience with such 
issues as soil erbsibh,_<»nservation;_use of pesticides, and con- 
sumptibn bf„traditibnal versus mainstream Anglo- Americaii 
f^. The^exi^rien^s can be applied to formal fields of science 
such as acoio^, ethology (the study of animal behavior), 
genetics; geology^ and nuMtion. 

Of course, as Cole and Seribner (1974) point but^ "hbw people 
perceive the envirdnmeiit, how th^ classify it^ hb^ tfiey tHS 
about it" varies across cultures (p. 5). Tte ASAS' ethnosdence is 
a field study which attempts to deUneata mtfaiaa^particu^ 
ctiltui^ its pattenis of perception^ classificatibn, and tfaoiaght: 
W<Lr|ing within the context bf Native American culture, Cajete 
(1986) defines ethnoscience as, 

the methods, thought prcx^esses, mind sets; vidues; 
concepts, and experiences \^ whict JSatrve Am^can 
groups understand, refltM^t^ and obtain empirical knowledge 
about the natural world, (p. 1)

These methods and concepts may dfflersiiktly and^amatically 
from the way in which Anglo-Americans l^&^^n^^c^^^f^^ 
dominant English-speaking ciUtxire) interpret the en^nmment; 
If, for e^uimple, a lesson dealing with frogs is presented to Anglo 
and Native American sttideiits, their subjective reactions 
(positive and h^atlvelj to touching a frog wiU he derived not only 
trom their individual personalities: but from their aiiltufal 
ba^^Qunds^S-weU; fiieybiid the rather specific issues of frpgs^ 
students from traffitibnaL Native American backgrounds inight 
be more inclined taseascient^c pmc^^aS^m ahbUstic^in^^ 
view while students from mainstream -Anglo-Anierican 
backgrounds might be more interested in breaking domt the 
subject into its smallest components. Cajete (19B6r p* 50) 
discussal the work of Maniyama and HarkiiiB U978), which 
describes, for example^: Western c^ssificatipn systems as tending 
to before hierarchical and quantitative while Native .^^ericaii 
systems tend to be more mutualistic and qualitative. Western 
systems^ _aIso tend to _see .cause-effect relatibhships as 
unidirectional; _ linear, phenomena^ 3^ hereas_ _ Native _ American 
thought patterns tend to &Uow for numy possibte 
cause and effect. As Cajete (1986, p. 6) explains, ''r^use md eBect 
cannot be isolated from other causes and effects v^ ith which they 
share a whdUstic re 

Differing scientific wdHd views, however, do not have to mean 
mutuaUy exdusive appr^ science iessdiis. Iii the 

school scuehce: setting bbt^ Natiy Americem and non-Native 
American students ahd teacLhera have sbmethi^ to Contribute 
and something to learn fiom each other. If Ihe relationship be- 
tween the traditional Native American faon^ oiltt^ cmid ihe 
Westernized school cuitiu^e is a two-way atreet; the qu£&t^£^ 
practicality of the scientific learning experience can be enhanced. 
Suppose^ in other words, that (ramculum and methods become 
reapbnsive tathe patterns and experiences of the home cultures, 
ahdthat^^at the same timierthe Ickral cbmmuhity adapts practices 
or concepts frop^^iheloriiaisc mig^ have 

relevance to sol^t^g problems in_t£e J€)cd-ehvirdiizneht. Oh this 
point, Scribner and Cole (1973), make the foabwing observation: 

Changes m textl^ks, ciirrioiU, and teaching techiiiclues 
are all h^ed and imiK)rtaht. but th^ cannot be counted on 
to bridf^ the gulf between jschbbl jind p^^ by 
themselves. A two-way niovement is ne^ssi^-^hfii^ Tfie 
first, which is already under way in some experimental

schools, is to move everyday Ufe into the school so that sub- 
ject matt^ aiid actiyitiesL deal with some bf_ the saiie 
aspects of social and physical reality that the pupils con- 
front outside of school 

-The.^oiiifias Eera fittl^ attempted; the techniqutr nf 
thejmiodem jMdiooi need to be introduced into the ccntext of 
^ODgcdzed practical problems. Education must be stripped 
from the schoolroom and made instrumental in traditional ^ 
settings, (p. 558) 

In other ^ordsr interchanges we to be made between the home 
oaiture and the sdiool culture. Guthridge (1986), in an article eh* 
titled "jEgkiinos Solve The Futufe/V points cmt how he uses 
studeiits' cAiiturlU frame re^reiice to solve fiiture problems. 
Guthrid^ has trmhed te^s of students from JJambelL Alaska^ 
to compete in the Future Prbblem Solving Pro-am; These Jeanis 
have won state and naUbhai.Awa^ ^any. assigned pro^ 
blems— such as the:iiufmng of theiiath's clim or the use of 
laser-t^fiiol6^--r^u&e student research in scientific fields. 
Guthridge points out that 

In Future Prbblem Sblvdhg: at GambeH^^^^ have learned to

Stm^nts find, record, and memorize possible problems and 
solutions that might be applicable to the assipied subject 
matter, and then— slowly— figure but what the material 
means, (p. 71) 

- Steps involved in the Future Problem Slolving model were 
originally designed with a Western mind set in which a gri^tdeal 
of verbal interaction was required among students. Guthridge^ 
however, acc^ted students' up of: their own commuhicatibh 
style and pace until it felt comfortable and necessary to move 
toward more verbal articulatibn of ideas. He credits^ihe^ 
tacular iucceas students frbm^ambell have_&adJa jcbming up 
with highly ima^atLveioIutibni to to this flex- 

ibUit^ri^ approach^ -St^ wb c have 

se^edtheir hunting ancestors well for nulleimia but, at the same 
time, they acquire akiil in using some Western probiem-gdlving 
techniques which they can and may, in the future, af^ly to local 
issues. In discussing the Westorn^efsus the native world views^ 
Guthridge tells his: students^ /The human brain is nbthing 
more— and nothing less— than ah efficient computer. Why hot

TBe role of iSe native language and EngUsh _ _^ _ 

The second important issue relevant to the AAA&it^ommen- 
datidhs for Native Americans' science education which we.^ 
ex^ihe is the role of the home language rad^^^ role of £ngiish 
SngiSgaifevddpnieht Ac<^^^ Title VII guidelines, the

gain an understanding of .scientific content and processes. Accor* 
ding to Chamot aniO'Mai^^ the CALLA approach can be us^ 
effectivel^^tfi with limited English proficient students and 
En^isfa<lominant students who come from a mihbrity-lahguage 
background. They point out that ah 

example of the cohhectibh betweeaiJie sci^^ curriculum 
and language expeiienc^^ must use language 

actively to r^^n tfarou^ an observation from its inception 
to a inclusion. The process of analyzing a problem, 
describing, classifying, and other skills that are 
fundamental to science mirnc^^ ah ihtegral part of 
language develdpmeht. (1986, p. 27) 

Rather thm emanating strictly from a mcuhstream science 
text, the students' cultural backgrbuhd can be incb^orated into 
CALLA science lessons. For example, the authors surest that 
soh^ le - Dhs bi: based on disc(»rering-the scientific properties of 
familiar things ftbrn. the students' home background. 

Teachers isinj^_the £A£t A j«ipproach, teyond plahhihg an 
acti\dty-baised science iesson, ^so prepare to address such things 
asL the^CKadb^uiary needed for the lessdh (for eMmplci the cbllb- 
qmai meaning of "dense" versus the scientific meanihg),^ the 
types of language structures ihvblyed (for example,^ '•more than" 
and -iess than"), and the types of study ikiUirequired (for exam- 
ple, how to 4ise reference bbbks^ diagrams, tables); 

Ih preparing such leisbhs, care heeda to be taken not to wator 
down the cbnteht bf th^lessbn wfaSesimplifying the language to 
therequired d^^^^erefore, to maintain the appropriate level 
of difficulty Jn content, it may be highly desirable topreview ahd 
review the lesson in the students' home language. Thus, to have 
the most success with a CALLA appfpeich. to sdehce. teachers 
ne^ _l^ well-versed hbt only in scfehce content, process, and 
actiyitieSi but alsb in ESL and bffingual teaching jmnciples. In 
the Native American context, often involving small schools ih 
remote, mnal Jcxrations, teamteaching and use of hbh-schbbl 
hrnnaiL resources may be important in having the greatest 
success with a iCALLA approach For example, a Ibcal Btaff 
member with ESL training hiight work with a visiting geolb^st 
from university to pr^are some lessbns.

Getting stttdents intf rested iii science 

_^R£bi^tb the devdqpment of Unguage through the science 
mrnoalum is our third importmt issue, the place of science 
mtfain the overall school oimcUium. The AAAS reconunended 
that Native American students 1^ actively recruited Ui study 
science and technology. This is an impbryint: goal to be 
enoiuraged. But, to accomplish it^ students need to be expoa^ to 
science in a positive: and meaningful way early in^ementary 
sch(xil. It may b^too late to attract students^byihe t&e they are 
in high schc<>l. _7brtiinatd seem to appr^cfa

iife^bc^, antelope, other children, horses, ^eer, butterflieSi 
trout, and so forth. Th^ are fasciiuited by sucb^: natural 
phenomena ajs electrical storms, shdw^ wihd^ and rain. They love 
to observe what happens when they thrdw^ intb the water; 
Human-made Jtems like seem^^pcal to them; ao do

on. in other words, chiidren's natural desirea to make sense out of 
their environment (with^ its beauty, complexity, and mysteiy), 
can be nurtured formally in the elemental grades so that the 
spark is not ^ne by the time these children are in high sch(X)l 
The rpsdnifor doing this ia hot just so that we can have a higher 
number of Native American pciehtists later dh^butad eS Native

reading. Viewing content areas, such as adence,jas powerful and 
eicitihg whicles for learning to read, he offersJtfe f bUcLwihfe sug-

EKLC 



can easily be translated to a situation where tea(Lhers are_working 
with laiiguage-ininbnty students such as Native Americans: 

- T&B subjective observation that the student *can't read 
the textbook" is based on the incorrect nbtion thaLihey 
should be able to read that matenaL independently. 
Assignments are given; students do poorly in their at- 
tempts to read_ the material; theieacfaer is disappointed; the 
students are friistrated. (1978, p. 17) 

In the situation which Herber descrit^^ t^cSngis not really go- 
ing on. It does hot take much iibagination lor- a teach to tell 
students to read a i^itaiiLs^tio^df the^book and answer ques- 
t^s at this endof thexh§pter.l^ of teaching comes in prj> 
%admg studenta m to build a bridge between what th^ 
al^dy faiowand what they ne^ to learn. In Herberts approachi 
readtog for comprehrasion requires active ehgagemeh of science 
teachers with their students in such a way that: 

(1) before teachers give specific reading assignments; they 
discuss with students the bbj stives to be attained from the 
reading; 

(2) that teachers and^tuleats Ssrass prior material or ex- 
periences which set the context in which the new material is to be 
leamed;^and 

_ (3) that tochers carefully examine the vocabulary students 
need to understand to make sense of the reading material 
(Berber, 1978, p. 38).

Both the CALLA approach and Herber's content^area reacto^ 
can_serve to ihU^rite two subjects into one (for example, 
sci^c^ESL or sdehce/reading). Such integration of subject mat- 
ter iiiy Be considered a rnethod culturally compatible with some 
Native American traditions. In that respect, Cajete comments 
that 

There is no word in any iraditicmfl^ 
language which can be translated to mem "^ffliOB" as it is 
viewed in mcKiern Western society. Jtotiier^ thB_ thought

was inte^teisattjBUl bthe^ of Native American 

cultural organizations. (1986, p. 4) 

It follows nattiraiiy that, in incorporating Native Ameri«ns* 
traditibnal backgrounds into the fonnal science^ xnffnmlumt ^ 
variety of areas of study or experiences can be interrefatted.^!ts 
will be seen in the fdlldwing fiction on resources, for raampte,

Ideas for use of tM locai environment 

The_fcllawing materials exemplify some exciting ways t<} use 
locaL^sources to teach science within the cultural and eh- 
viromnentai context of Native Amencah students.

7. Sometimes an idea for the science curriculum may come 
from an unlikely source. For example, Hale (1980), a Biiguist, sag- 
gests: 

The study of language should foni^a pari of jcuriiculum. 
liinguistic science has^ tte advantege-over.othffir^deiicfi^ 
that the data relevant to it are immediately accessible, even 
to the youngest of studentSr and it requires a minimum of 
Material and equipment, (p. 3) 

In other words, according to Hale^^ence^teacher^ 
use "linguistic knowli^ge which students pos»sss as a subject 
matter of science" (p. 3). For example, he suggests that by engag- 
ing students in :Gyti iuialy»^^^ pf the structure of their home 
language^ th^ will "begin to formulate the laws which govern 
the observable : bSha\abr linguist form. Observing data and 
making ^neralizatibns about it is an impk>rtant activity at this

_ The bUingual student is a disadvantaged mathematics 
leamer-in terms of both caltural orientation and language pro- 
^ssing. It is too simple to say that "American Indians Hon't 
have math brains" or that they "can't do math." Such coSSents 
come aU tM easily in the face of th« poor ajffieveSent oi 
AmenMtt Jndian students in matheinatics _Beyoiid about the 
fourth grade level. The rcsjxihsible educator must ask "Why do 
these students net perfdrin better in_mathema tics?" and "What 
can be done to^elp them learn more effectively?" The task for the 
mathenatics educator is to desi^ a curriculum that will enable 
Native American students to do better.

they reco^^e^hem; 

2. Twenty-six of the students use 6rQw^umber names. jvhen 
speaking with other Crow Indians, especially with Jbniily 
members. For example, some students living or spending con- 
siderable time with their grandparents speak only Crow while 
wit^ them. This suggests that the students are using the Cro v 
number naihes they know.

4. Nineteen of the students used mathematics only when deal*

the hbtich that these students :iy|sdciate the use of the Crow

long as it makes sense in terms of the way they process informa- 
tion. Initiallyy U^e of the native language is important as ah aicLtb 
learning English-language termindlbgy; the cbhtinued successful 
learning of mathematics depends on students Jbeing able to pro- 
cess the ideas in aLTieaiflhpul way; Accordingly, it appears that

Summary 

- Three i^uences affect the American Jndian student's capacity 
ta leam English language mathematics. The first is the role of 
language, tl»e second is the culture, and the third is the student's 
leaniing style. 

The authors foUad that Crow Indian bilihguaL students are h 
maintaining mastery of the Crow language as Knowledge 
Crow Uiiguagc mathematicaL^ concerned^ This 

miseB _quesU6m education in 

matl^niadcs instruction, at least in terms of mathematical 
vocabulary. Incomplete learning of mathenuitics vocabulary in 
the children's first language may b«$ creating children who have 
incomplete mastery of eithor their &&t Uui^a 
construct or the constructs of English. The influence of the 
students' culture, and the perceived: relevance of the 
mathematics >mrn(mlum^ is seen as axs^additional problem; Exr 
cept for working mth moneys stadenta 
mathematics they learn in icfaool to b&of wy use to them, nor is 
tte^ ^cfaool curriculum seen as cuitundly relevant. Most 
si^iificantiy , the students did not share either a large number or 
a wide mnge of goals. The sclu>ol curriculum, as Sir as the»| 
students wet^ concerned, lelated to just one goal^eaniing

At first, many may have classified ^ views of Papert and

Dr. JucUth Hakesi du-ecterif a prqject designed to aid the 
Aroma tribe, a memfe irf the All Indian Pueblo Council near 
Albuquatiue, Sew Mexico, revealed signs of the ever-widening 
technology facmg Native Americans as follows:

Tntoriti software. Tutorial mictt^omputer softwar&is dJfficdt 
to create because it instructs; it attempts to emulate teachers in

presentbg new material to learners. WhOe tutorial softwSe may 
be fcHind at any of Gaffhe-s (19701 level^oZlMrning, it is typically 
deyd(^)ed for disc^^ con^pt learning, rule learn- 

ing, and developing prbblcm-solving strategies. For this reason 
tutorials are adaptafilei^ a wide range of curriculum areas— from 
arta to p^sicil^ciences CGagne, Wager, & Rojas, 1981). Alfred 
Bork (1985), taffing about tutorials, said: 

Computer material must be designed to allow for not just a 
single conversaticMLietween the student and teacher (the 
computer) but rather an entire set of all possible conversa- 
tions" (p.62). 

Cogtraiy to Bbrt a _^ew, however, most microcomputer 
tuibrials are being jprwi^^^ only one teaching model in 

inihd. It ia vBi^^ expensive to produce tutorial software with 
mulUple^diing models. However, el^trdhic publishing is still 
in ite infancy and more elaborate tutorials may be foriJxconnn^ 
We know the population of learners is diversiB so that^oretSn 
one teaching model is r^uired to reach ijnajdnty of atodents. 
Thus, if tutorial software it to makia si^ficant contribution, a 
mujti-mpder apprMch^^^i^^^ for it to go. 

Strickland (198D) desmbed^ computer-managed metric instruc- 
tion packa^whicELdamonstrated the need for careful^-designed 
tulkuiaL sfoltware for use with students having a wide range of 
leaning styles. 

The degree of complexity of a tutorial program ihcreaaei aait 
requires more branches to allow for this variability of leSning 
styles. The more branches^ the greater ihdividua^ation is p^^ 
ble with students and subject matter; As^iHs evolution of 
tutorial cdmplexitgr continues _ it moves to^ /nteUigent 
Cbmputer-ylssiated /m and ultimately to 
* 'expert" ^st^ns JSuch-systems, now begimiing to emerge, show 
gr^t^proniiae^for education. Unfortunately, some of the l^st ex- 
an^Iesjof computer tutorials are found on midnframe computer 
systems. Slowly, some of these are being converted taimcrbcdm- 
put^ operating systems and will eventually find their way into 
K-12 ctessrdoms. 

Teachers of Indians heed to cai^J^y jexamme iomm^cialiy-

In evaluating program^bjectives. a teacher should use norSs 
^^v^^ Wafition being tested. This may mean 
estabhsbii^ newjnorms from test data at a^ particular school or 
^whicfi^tudents may find mbre meaangful than stendaf ds 
basedOT a brger pi^ulatidn with litOe or no representation from 
Natiw Amenans. Develbpmentel tables are not as unique to a 
population, but have mbjfe umveraal appUcabUity. 

PtepiKf and Cbburn st^s the importance of positive feeSbiS 
m^teaching children. A atudy in Medfdrd. Oregon, shoired that a 
4;1 rafao of positi™ to negative feedba^ was most beneficial to 
student acluevement in elemental grades. Seek opportunities to 
com^d c^n f or corT«:t efforts even though the exact result 
desired is stiH to be attained. 

Involve parents in the education process to gain their support 
andtoCTMte _a supportive home atmosphere. Open houses and 
sports festivals are two possible ways to increase parental par- 
ticipation. Other recommendations, based on Effective Practices 
m lndum Education: A Teacher's Monograph, are the f oUowing: 

1. Recognize that Indians and non-Indians can be effective 
teachers of Indiat children. 

2. Realize that Indian children are taught to be accountable for 
their own actions, and that discipline is handled differently than 
m non-Indian culture. 

Appreciate that there are some deep-seated, differences 
culturally that trace back 20,000 to 50,000 years. 

ALummichild in Washington stated. "All childr-in are not the 
am^ physically, socially, or culturally." (Pepper & Cobum. 
1985). Let us accept what even a child knows: everyone cannot be 
treated identicaUy; some adaptations are necessary both for 
cultural survival anu for individuals to receive optimal, educa- 
tional benefits through physical education.

Parents: The Indian Child'l 
First Teac h^f I 

Sandra Kay Sifveier 



Parents are the most important j>«Diple in a child's educatidiial 
life, indre unpprtMit thai teacftM-s, book playmates, and t^s. 
Parents, whether they &iow it or not, train their children to live 
in society andJMuence their attitude about themselves ind 
school. WJmt cfiito and how interested they are ih^leafn- 

ing ja^ctesely related to how their parents mi about educatiott; 
TSs becomes very significant when working with students not 
from the dominant culture. ^ 

Most schools in the Unit^ States Mve a cultural base that is 
not Indian even when enrollment Jb mostly Indian. Asa result^ 
rules, regulations, and cummlum are frequently unfam^^ to In- 
dira students. This unfandhmuBnvironment can be laid to the use 
of Ei^Ush as tte main or^ many times, the only language and to 
tiacbera and^tag un with working with children from 

Inffian^odtui^s. Often there is a notable absence pf Indian adults 
teacWngin the school. Consequently, a child looks to the pebpte 
at home to find out if it is "okay" to partidpate in thisJlnew'* 
environment. Parenta' attitudes and training of the child become 

vety sigmficant at this time. 

This ^hapter focuses on cfiBdren's «irly interactional ex- 
periraces at homa and how they relate to children's later 
academic^BiAV^nMnt. throughout the chapter there are recbm- 
mehdattons for addressing parental involvement.

this early emphasis on language will help prepare children for 
school.

stage, at approumately seven yeari of age, children are capable 

ofdnaintHinihg fluency in both languages. 

__ I^therly {1985)i bas^on^n^tensive review of the research, 
x^^mnended that Indian parents speak to their children in the 
language in which they are most fluent. If one parent is fluent in 
English and another in en Indian language, the child benefits if

Amato and Ochiltree (1988) found that family envii'onments 
conducive to the develc^ment of competence in children: 

1. Encourage children's attempts at mastery. 

2. Give children r^^ponsive and realistic fe^back. 

3. Provide waxtn and supportive emotional eiivirdnmente: 

4. Ehcbiirs^ children to explore and manipulate their eh-

6. E^vide fal^ educattonal aspirations and expectations for 
children. 

7. Provide assistance with school work. 

8. Give rational direction to children's activities,: with atten- 
tion to issues rather than to puxiishmenjk. This is also mora 
successful than allowing cliildreh to r^ulate their own ac-

Young parents many timra have not thought threug^ tiidr

esp^mUy true when they ai^ personally involved in fihdmg their

^ttroojess in school is important, then the cbmmumty^tnSe, or 
n^ds to address the issue of what can be done to help 
parents provide active support to children^ Watson, Brown, and 
Swict(1983) suggest the foUowing guidelines: 

!_. :Pai^nt8_must^haye a community suptx)rt network from 
whia thi^ ^ dtaw in carrying out their roles. tThis can be a 
^entrtoBcher organization, a church group, a traditional Indira 
society, or their extended fanuly.) 

2. Parents must peiteiv their role as A^educator" and their 
children's rple as -4ea^ to the func- 

tioning of the family. (What pacente Jive to teach children is jUM, 
as important as what the schooliias to teach.) 

_ 3. Parents muaLact on their perceptions that learning is essen- 
for h^thyii^y Hving. (Parents must spend time with and 
give Attention to their children.) 

Parrats must understand and l^bw young children. (You^ 
Indfe parents are lucky to Usuafly be abfe to rely xmihe wisdom 
and help of their parents and and their extended family in bring- 
ing up their children.j 

The Watson study indicated that immy ^ents believe it is im-

The important factor in building self discipline, then, iaattitude* 
If teachers respect students, they build those students' self 
respect. 

Children usually live up to a teacher -a expectations. If they can 
see that you expect them to cause trouble, wh;^ shouldn't they? It 
is hot going to change your bpihibh of them. However, if all ybui- 
actibns indicate that you have confidence in their doing the right 
thing^^ifiey won't betray that cbhfidehce. They live up to your ex- 
pectations.

away from home. Look at the classroom and ask yourself^ "Is this 
a place I would choose to be if I were a child?" I have seen 
students that a teacher had to push out the door at the end of the 
day to get them to go home. The majority of them were Native 
American children who were members of a problem-free 
classroom. 

A prbbleni'&ee classroom is one with a teacher who ehjc^s 
teaching, Jthd lets children feel this jehjoymeiit. Areybu compas- 
sioimte? Bb you Iffie cBil£en? Hav^^ an. ^u£LB^g for 
children of afi cnltures? Is this evident from your actions, not just 
from what you say? If your answer to these questions is yes, you 
probably will have a problem-free classroom, because the best 
way to handle discipline problems is to prevent them from 
starting. 

liiiderstaiid cultiu'e _ 

M^st common discipline problems can be prevented much more 
easily than they can be stqpj^ To prevent or stc^ discipline 
problems iii Indian students, you must understand Indian 
ailture, and the aff^t various actions may have oh Native 
American students. The most iinport^t ddifference between 
white_ahd Native Ammcau oUtures is the Indian iemphisijs_bii

level £md-widens the^p you. Since an Indian looks in 

theB}^ (udy of an equal, a wider s^p makes it impossible for the 
child to do so. 

Do not expect students to understand that sdlodl is imporjbaht 
and that you as a teacher are to be respected: and obeyed. Many 
Indian famlies see little relation between. school and importa^^

Because of past conflicts between Indians and whites, some In- 
dian children come to school harboring strong resentments learh- 
ed from their fanulies Umards all whites and even sometimes In- 
chahs who work for whites at a school. It is better to talk out 
those resentments, perhaps in specicU lessons on Ind^ hisibi^ 
than suppress them. Events such as the Trail bfTears^ The Lbng 
WaBci^ Bak^_ MasM^ Baral-^6r^^ Wbui^ed Knee^ and 
coun^tiess other tragi^es happened ^ erased. The 

solution is to ^t students to think and talk about how such 
events came to take plac^ and how they can be prevented iii the 
future. In social studies, compafisdns can be dr^wn to historical 
and present events such as tr^tment of Jews in Nazi Germany 
and of Blacks in South Africa. If white students come in with the 
the same feelings about Indians, pBrhaps based bh what happen- 
ed to their ahcestbrs, the same approach is suggested.

substitutes for direct criticism.

means of discipline in miuiy tribes. It is an acc^table way of cor- 
recting^ as long as it is ddne in j>nvat6^ or in such a wayLthat it 
does not put the student in a bad light ambng his friends. Teasing

this way, the child does m)t have ^ be criticized directly, and the 
discipline does not have to come from the parents.

Do M_you wDilid be 

Inxnany tnbes^ coiporai punislmient, the use of force to obtain 
disdpfinG, was almost unknown. Striking children was c^ 
sidered barbaric. It would not show^respect for a child, and self 
cUsdpline is built on self respect. The assumptibh was that if 
children were given resp^t, they would resp^t others. Spank- 
ings would violate tjus prihdple of mutuaLS^ 

: One way you can judga M discipinary action you pk tt* Tjse 
is by asS^g yourself, ••How jirfl^^ react to this treab 

ment fr(ffla^a^sui^rior? Would it maintain my self respect? Would 
it no^e me want to do the right thing, or would it make me want 
to rebel?" 

One Indian said to a teacher, ••You have a right to do to a child 
in dass anything you are willing for the prihdpal to do to you 
during your teacher's meeting. - ' : 

No Ueacher should yell at children or thriMien then. These are 
other actions that destroy self respect Cffidren leara from your 
example ataUtimea^^ot just w£en you want them to! You would 
hot (Undone tSs behavior from children. If a child does yell at 
you, veiy unflkdy with In^an children, don't iimtate him. Imita- 
tion is thesincerest form of flattery! Threats injdicate to children 
that you think they are notg^ing to do the thing requested. Once 
aj^ain, they will probably 15v3 tip to your: expectations. 
Remember, the Sioux are not concerned with eUmiiiatihg M 
fc^havipr but with developing positive good beha^ 
through shared respdhsibiU^. You andyour-Studenta^ust^m^ 
as a team to develop the responsibility that leads to a pleasant at-

honest with the children about what you are trying to do^ and 
your reasons. Then when it goes wrong, admit that it did not 
work,: and try spmethi^n^^ 

Self discipline is hot dbediehce. It is doing what needs to be 
done. It is learning to see what h^ds to be done, doing it to the 
extent that s^ms reasonable, and learhmg frxttn the mistakes. 
Someone said that Cherbkees treated tb^^^ children as adults. A 
Cherokee answered,-'-Nc; weireaLthem as human beings. That is 
a status you only accord to adults, and usually only to adults of 
your own social status." _^ _ __ - - - - 

Children in the classroom should be convinced that there Js 
nothing wrong with making mistakes— once. That is how we ail 
learn. But they mtist learh to make responsible decisions, then ac* 
cept the respbhsibility for those decisions. Among the Blackfeet, 
it was cdmmbh that when a respected relative died^ a child wcmld 
he ^ven the name of that person. The chfld then felt resiwhsible 
for fivingipibJJiat name; Ahyt^ be a reflection 

on the ori^rSi^wner jof iheiame; Along^ with this responsibility 
the child ^ined the self respect of being considered worthy of the 

name. : i z-_-i---_:-i-_-_: izn : -::z::„ 

In the middle class urban community, teachers can usuaHy 
cbUht oil parent suppi^rt iii problems of discipline. In the Native 
cbminuhity,^ school ajcid home are separate entities. Neither in- 
terferes with the other Pareht8:may have Uttlet^

school's respbusibility.: Indian parents may believe that a child 
wfll bfly be fixistrat^d by '^cbirecti If there is cbh- 

troi, it has to come Kom the children themselves. 

Group control is effecHve

the behavior of Native-students. American. Indians^ are ^bup 
oriented. Group appr<ovai is much more impbrtant.t&tnJteacher

cpc^rating with the group or the teacher, the group is sure to 
win. To the autocratic teacher this can mean sure trouble. But for 
the teacher who can motivate the group, get it interested, aiid

Modify behayior thrdfigh pride atid approval 

Most Native children, especially younger ones, will work very 
hard for a few words of af^roval from parents or aii elder, or from 
you, their teacher. They may be insensitive to plihishmeht^ but 
they react very favorably: to praise. However, the praise must hot 
be Idiid bbyidtis praise which separates them from the group. If

In the old Indian life sotous xrimes occasibhally had ta be 
punished, although they were rare.. A.Cl^enne who kill^ 
another was ostracized from the tribe and made tb Uve abnei 
usually fbr several years. If he survived, he was, atlSend_bf this 
time, accepted back into the tribe, fully, with no toss of^esti^ 
br_ position. The object was not punishment, but rehabffitar 
tion— change of behavibr. Feeling of guilt or resentment had no 

place in this. _ _ z_ . i 

In modem hfe^ isblatioiir shame may be used to bring a 
change of behavior; but after repentana^the incident is not held 
over the child, and he holds no permineht sense of guilty s^lf

GmH^1981 j demonstrated that the faS^ "g" factor claimwi to

acrcws aD unportant co^Uve^ctions actually exists only as a 
mathematical entity when one uses the particular statistical

_ a^ay^^co^ritive science enables educators io"go beyond in- 
tem^nce tMts and understand how the Jinman iind solves pro- 
blems (Sternberg. 1986i p. 157). Why^despite these facts, does 
^t testmg^m mulUcultural schools still rely upon tests that 
embody these outdated perspectives? The answer is that, at a 
smiple^level, educater8^(fflce others) hold fast to those explana- 
tions that^serve them wefl and^ which th^ are familiar ftnd 
comfortable^ A more compfex answer involves the myriad prbfes- 
sional. sddo-pbUtiail, and cultural forces that lead every profes- 
sional body to accept one set of explanations while rejectihg 
ociicrs. 

To escape present confining theories and models is a formidable 
task. A jphiralistic model is possible, but r^iuires the difficult 
ta^ of assessment across a inuch wider ^poctrum of behaviors 
andsituations (Mra-cert 1979), alon^ TOth development and use of 
local norms (Elliott & Bretzihg; 1986); While pluraUsffi. or the ac- 
ceptance and appreciation^of diversity, has gained <:dn8iderable 
acc^tance in other educational areas, testing has been slow to 
accommodate. 

Another alternative model would be to focus upon the pro- 
oes^ engaged in hy humahs when tflcing tests. Such a focus 
would center OTarainatibns upbiJmw the examinees were taking 
the test^ not simply upbi what prahicts and achieveinents thw 
evidence. Sternberg's jBxtensive recent research Jrihgs cbn- 
Mderable attention to the prowssesjjf intelligence. Therefore in- 
dividuals involved itt testing in multicultural contexts must 
prbte the theorieaand models behind any tests used with their 
students. For instimce. is the "two factor" thebry behind the 
Wechsler series appropriate for ybui- students? Is Kaufman^s 
ABE^ test sufficiently sensitive to Luria's heurbpsychblo^cal 
theoiy to assess significantly Jiffereht diinehsibhs than the 
Wechsler and Stanford-Binet? These illustrate questions about 
theory and model.

can, and often are, considered as sacred oral text. In some

''Story'' as a mental ^ 

The mind creates, operates^ ahd refihes mental models or struc- 
turea of knowledge, which /lecbnfigure and then represent the 
nmvirse. Such mental mbdcQs constitute ways in which we 
* * know;' ' Pet _ j3 invent jnodela jwhich configure .memory for the 
propt:^rties things, P&ces^peo|de, crrcumst^ces^ex^^ 
relaticnships, causes, and effects. CRir models are 
truths which nmy be refmed and changed by data^from outside^ 
but whkh we also impose upon the world outside to verify what 
we think: we understand, We are successful, M individuals and as 
cbmihunities^ to the degree bur intenlalized models, private and 
collective, are reasbnibly good predictors <}f outside cir- 
cumstance. Paradoxically^ internal models can also make biitside 
cSoiinstanca. We see^and hear what we project upon the world 
around us (SiSth,1982t -^ _ _ _ _ _ 

**Story" is an invention ol tte hunian miBrfrTra k^ 
structure or an an idea in the form of a model or schema. It is a 
way of knowing, a way of org^mizing information, and is, by 
itself, a truth. The stmctures of stories are sub* 

structures of "stbiy.": Each wb-stnicture, or sL'i3:le story, 
recbhstructs a part of the cbsmblbgy of a people and a mental 
model in its own^right. Educatbra who have leanied to think bf 
"reafity " ii impHcaL terihs irn^t be inclinf^ to jreot^t the

(even the Ukes of Hansel and Gretel, The Three Little Pigs^ and
