ABSTRACT 

A 3-day conference developed guidelines ensuring that 
cultural needs and issues are addressed in mathematics, science, and 
technology educational programs for American Indian and Alaska Native 
precollege students. Major barriers affecting these students in 
mathematics, science, and technology were summarized for three areas 
(student programs, curriculum development, and teacher programs), and 
guidelines were developed to address them. Guidelines for student 
programs include recognizing students for their participation, 
providing the opportunity to develop as whole persons, establishing 
mentoring within local communities, and facilitating parental 
involvement. For curriculum development, guidelines include aligning 
curricula with the community's needs and goals, including: cultural 
needs, holistic and spiritual approaches, local knowledge, language, 
elders, and mentors; using hands-on, cooperative group activities; 
and ongoing evaluation. Teacher program guidelines include 
understanding the students' culture; integrating traditional American 
Indian science, mathematics, and technological knowledge in classroom 
teaching; employing hands-on, inquiry-based learning, cooperative 
learning, and problem-solving activities; and making science, 
mathematics, and technology relevant by including community members 
and resources in teaching and learning. Three appendices describe the 
conference: review the literature on barriers to mathematics, 
science, and technology education for American Indian and Alaska 
Native students; and list additional resources, (Contains 20 
references.) (TD)

INTRODUCTION 



"Indian people want their children to value their 
culture and traditions, but they also want their 
children to have basic academic competencies 
and subject-matter knowledge. Among the criti- 
cal issues for American Indians is how to reconcile 
Indian spiritual values and formal education. " 

The College Board/AISES, 1989 



This document was developed from a three-day conference held in May 
1 994 in Boulder, Colorado, sponsored by the American Indian Science and 
Engineering Society's Research and Evaluation Department under a grant 
from the National Science Foundation. 

The primary goal of this project was to develop a set of recommended 
guidelines for ensuring that cultural needs and issues are addressed in 
mathematics, science, and technology educational programs for American 
Indian/Alaska Native precollege students. Specifically, conference partici- 
pants focused their discussions on the following two questions: 

1 . What are the major barriers, concern, and issues that should be 
addressed in any student, curriculum and teacher preparation 
project for American Indian/Alaska Native students? 

2. What strategies or methods should be employed to ensure that 
the cultutal issues identified are addressed in student, curriculum 
and teacher preparation projects for American Indian/Alaska 
Native precollege students?

These guidelines complement other relevant guidelines and documents 
that shape programs and projects in science, mathematics, and technology 
education for American Indian/Alaska Native precoliege students. The 
intended purposes of this document are to provide the following: 

- Guidance to those who are designing, implementing, and evaluating 
science, mathematics, and technology programs for American Indian/ 
Alaska Native precoliege students 

- Guidance to those who are working in science, mathematics, and 
technology areas for American Indian/Alaska Native students 

- Guidance to funding agencies and project and proposal reviewers 
covering mathematics, science, and technology education for American 
Indian/Alaska Native precoliege students 



Teachers must evaluate themselves ami their 
understanding oft heir oun culture as an initial 
j'trst step in understanding 'mother culture, 
and in incorporating that culture in their teach- 
ing and learning. 



Although specific content in mathematics, science, and technology was 
not discussed directly, its importance in teaching and learning was recog- 
nized throughout the conference proceedings. As content and culture are 
blended, both are strengthened and provide equal status in 
teaching and learning. 

The structure of this conference modeled 
strategies and procedures considered ef 
fective in working with American Indian,' 
Alaska Native students and their teach- 
ers, including cooperative work gioups, 
concept webbing, problem- solving 
activities, and a cultural awareness of 
American Indian/Alaska Native values.

PRECONFERENCE 
PREPARATION 



Preconference preparation included readings to help participants focus 
on the conference goals. The first, Our Voices. Our Vision: American India ns 
Speak Out for Educational Excellence (College Board/American Indian 
Science and Engineering Society, 1 989), focused on the National Dialogue 
Project on American Indian Education. Participants voiced their wants and 
needs through a series of regional dialogues.

ment, it recognizes the vtdne of A nerican In- 
dian/Alaska Xatu e spirituality,

The second reading, "Toward a Redefinition of American Indian/Alaska 
Native Education" (Hampton, 1 992), provided a summary of views toward 
education for American Indian/Alaska Natives. It discusses the current state 
of Indian education and addresses five different ways Indian education has 
been viewed, reflecting both Indian and non-Indian perspectives. 



The third reading, which came from the grant proposal for the confer- 
ence, focused on the barriers that American Indian/ 
Alaska Native elementary and secondary stu- 
dents encounter in mathematics and sci- 
ence education. This review of the 
literature highlighted issues such as 
Western versus Native views, cul- 
tural relevant e, learning styles, 
institutional barriers, lack of role 
models, psychological dynam- 
ics, langiMije, and cultural insen- 
sitivities, see Appendix B.

CONFERENCE OUTCOMES 



Each of the conference's three topical areas (student programs, curricu- 
lum development, teacher programs) generated two major outcomes: 

1 , A summary of major issues or barriers affecting American Indian/Alaska 
Natives in mathematics, science, and technology 

2. Guidelines to meet these issues and to provide effective education to 
elementary -id secondary American Indian/Alaska Native students and to 
their educaturs 

Some of the issues within the topical areas overlap, highlighting the 
important interrelationship among student, curriculum, and teacher pro- 
grams. In developing or implementing any one of these program areas, one 
should considerguidelinesfrom all three because much interconnectedness 
occurs. Also, these guidelines are not necessarily specific only to science, 
mathematics, and technology; rather, they encompass many educational 
aspects within precollege teaching and learning for American Indian/Alaska 
Native students. 

Student Programs 

The barriers, issues, and concerns affecting Native American/Alaska 
Native preccllege students can be summarized as follows: 

■ American Indian students suffer from a disproportionately high dropout 
rate when compared to the general population, resulting in an insuffi- 
cient numbei of American Indian/Alaska Native role models in math- 
ematics and science teaching positions, decision-makers within the 
educational system. 

■ Parental involvement is not adequately pursued or developed. 

■ Social issues relevant to the student's hves are not taken into consider- 
ation in their schooling. 

■ A lack of effective counseling services exist to encourage enrollment in 
the science, mathematics and technology fields 

■ The language used within science and mathematics is often foreign for 
many American Indian; Alaska Native precollege students. 

■ Many students must cope with discrimination in school, highlighting 
the lack of acknowledgment for their c ulture r ommunities. 




Guidelines Document 



■ As girls are often overlooked in science and mathematics, they are not 
adequately encouraged to pursue careers in these areas. 

■ Students are exposed infrequently to relevant American Indian Alaska 
Native issues in the science, mathematics, and technology experiences 
they have in school. 

■ Science, mathematics, and technology education frequently is 
culturally irrelevant to students and their communities. This leaves 
gaps in the development of a meaningful and relevant education. 

■ The community and the school often are not connected in their views 
cf students' educational goals, causing conflict among all groups 
involved with the educational process. 



Incorporating a holistic teaching npprmtch in 
tlw classroom promotes mental, emotional . 
ptivsicul and spiritual icell-heing in an indi- 
vidual student . This is the foundation on u huh 
American Indian Alaska Satire people have 
based their societies for centuries. 

Issues such as inadequate secondary school counseling, insufficient 
access to American Indian Alaska Native role models, lack of cultural 
relevance, and the ick of school-commun.tv partnerships all c ontribute to 
inadequate and in- ective studen' programs n elementary and stcordarv 
e lucation. These issues served as a ■ eferenc e n the generation of important 
factors to consider to ensure cuiUrallv relevant educ ation.

Guideline 1.1 - Recognize students for their participation and 
progress in science, mathematics, and technology, as well as for their 
general participation in the schooling process 



Q 




Figure 1 : Critical factors in student programs 



Students need to be recognized in their schools and communities as 
important contributing members. One way to achieve this is through their 
school accomplishments. Recognition should be cu'turally compatible 
within the community; valuing and honoring of the common person is very 
important. For example, student work such as science and mathematics 
projects should be displayed throughout the school and in suitable commu- 
nis buildings. 

Special program administrators should use the local and/or regional 
media to inform the community of events that feature mathematics, 
science, or technology, such as science fairs or invention conventions. When 
students attend a summer program, a press release should be sent to 
community media services.

Guideline 1 .2 - Provide students with the opportunity to develop 
themselves as whole persons: emotionally, spiritually, physically, and 
mentally. Include a needs analysis of student learning styles and 
cultures. 



Educators and administrators should offer students a variety of avenues 
for setting and achieving their educational goals. A needs analysis should 
reflect the emotional, spiritual, physical, and mental needs of students jnd 
their community. To best develop the whole person and meet individual 
learning styles, schools should establish programs, classes, and projects that 
accurately reflect the needs analysis. Extensive counseling services and 
tutorial programs must be given top priority and careercounseling must be 
in place for each student. Extracurricular activities should be accessible to all 
students, and transportation issues should not obstruct student participa- 
tion. Field trips to museums, science centers, urban areas, universities, or 
tribal colleges need to be incorporated into the curriculum of the total 
school projram. 



Guideline 1.3 -Establish meaningful partnerships and mentoring 
in all schools within local or neighboring communities and with 
national organizations. 



Mentoring within the school that involves students, teachers, staff, an 
administrators must be established. Several models for such programs are 
in use across the country. (See the appendix for names of places and 
organizations that provide services in mathematics, science, and technol- 
ogy.) In addition to in-house programs, partnerships with community 
organizations and businesses should be set up. Schools should be able to 
combine, modify and establish programs that accurately reflect the needs 
of the community and local culture. Contacts with national corporations 
and organizations for establishing summer corporate mentorship programs 
can be made and developed. Two-way communication is critical and must 
be built into any partnership. 

Guideline 1 .4 - Facilitate and effectively implement parental 
involvement for students to receive maximum educational benefits. 



Parents are the primary educators of their children and must have the 
opportunity for meaningful input into children's education. The nation's 
schooling system has disenfranchised American Indian/Alaska Native par- 
ents into thinking that they have no such rights. Schools must include 
parents as vital partners in the educational process. Traditional parent- 
teacher organizations need to be modified and enhanced to encompass all 
family situations. Parent-toacher conferences must be modified to mei't the

an 



schedules of both parents and students. Further, it is important to remember 
that the best location for parent-teacher interactions may not always be at 
the school, but instead at some other community location. 

Curriculum Development 

The barriers, issues, and concerns affecting curricula for precollege 
American Indian/Alaska Native students can be summarized as follows: 

■ Community needs and concerns are neither adequately identified nor 
integrated into the educational process, resulting in unnecessary and 
unresolved conflict between the school and community. 

■ Current curricula are not inclusive of American Indian/Alaska Native 
views. Research has shown that this constant neglect negatively affects 
minority students and how they view themselves as learners in the 
dominant society. 

■ Elders and olher American Indian/Alaska Native experts are not con- 
sulted to ensure that their knowledge is incorporated into the develop- 
ment process of science, mathematics, and technology curricula 

■ Current curricula are not holistic in scope. The American Indian/Alaska 
Native lifestyle of balance and holism is not supported in the hierarchical 
style of modern science and mathematics. 

■ Curriculum evaluation practices do not reflect cultural relevancy. Ad- 
ditional or adapted evaluation instruments are necessary to evaluate 
student progress, as current test-taking practices do not accurately 
reflect American Indian/Alaska Native students' understanding of sci- 
ence, mathematics, and technology. 

■ Spirituality comprises an important aspect of American Indian/Alaska 
Native learning and lifestyle, and current c urricula do not foster the 
spiritual relationship among people and their environment. Ignoring 
this aspect devalues the important relationship that American Indians/ 
Alaska Natives have with the Earth. 

■ Financial support for programs is insufficient for sustainability. When 
such resources become available to help facilitate growth, they often 
disappear before a program is firmly established and integrated into the 
school and community. 

■ Good academic proqrams cio not always get support from the 
school and community. Communication amonq school and commu- 
nity groups is not adequately in place, causing confusion, apathy, and 
mistrust 



Cuutrhnn Dotur >vit 




Issues such as lack of cultural relevance, little or no reference to American 
Indian/Alaska Native contributions to society and the sciences, lack of 
reference to community and spirituality, and the isolated study of topics all 
contribute to inadequate and ineffective curricula for elementary and 
secondary American Indian/Alaska Native students. These issues served as 
a reference in the generation of the important factors to consider to ensure 
culturally relevant education. 

Figure 2 illustrates the conference participants' concept web identifying 
the critical factors to consider when designing and implementing math- 
ematics, science, and technology curricula for American Indian/Alaska 
Native precollege students and their educators. 

The participants also generated five guidelines reflecting these critical 
factors for effective curriculum development projects:

Guideline 2.1 - Assess the current science, mathematics, and 
technology curricula in terms of the community's needs and goals. 



These community needs should be identified from the stakeholders' 
input. Stakeholders in the American Indian/Alaska Native community need 
to be identified and recognized, keeping in mind that the curriculum 
impacts beyond the classroom; some of them are the parents, students, 
teachers/facilitators, elders, school board members, tribal and other local 
government representatives, and additional interested community mem- 
bers. Existing as well as new mechanisms and networks should be used to 
engage all interested parties in the curriculum. An example of this would be 
to hold a community meeting at the village or chapter house to discuss the 
roles, rules, and responsibilities for the science, mathematics, and technol- 
ogy program that will operate within the community. Additionally, social 
interactions are important to engage stakeholders' participation. To be 
most effective, some type of professional compensation f or these resources 
should also be considered. Planners should base mathematics, science, and 
technology curricula on local community needs. 

Guideline 2.2 - Align the science, mathematics, and technol- 
ogy curricula with the assessed cultural needs and concerns of the 
community. 



Once the needs assessment has been completed (Guideline 2.1 ) and vital 
information has been gathered, the curricula in science, mathematics, and 
technology should be aligned accordingly. Credibility from and account- 
ability to the local community is vital. The existing tribal, national, and state 
science and mathematics goals also should be recognized, including 
identifying the strengths and deficiencies in the current curriculum. The 
missing and/or needed curriculum elements then must be addressed. The 
existing administrative support of the curriculum should be identified and 
expanded, as this is necessary for curricula continuity, resources, and 
materials. If the curriculum is to function as a shared creation between the 
developers and the community, it is essential to keep everyone's needs and 
goals in mind. 



Guideline 2.3 - Include the tollowing (based on the community's 
needs assessment) in designing a science, mathematics, and technol- 
ogy curriculum: hol'stic and spiritual approaches; relevant local Ameri- 
can Indian/Alaska Native cultural knowledge, materials, methodology, 
and language utilization; leadership training; and community elders, 
role models, and mentors. 



Q 14 



Guidelines Document 



/ 



Spirituality is an important aspect of American Indian/Alaska Native 
learning and lifestyle. By including it in curriculum development, planners 
acknowledge its value of American Indian/Alaska Native students. Text- 
books in science and mathematics do not emphasize this approach and 
should be augmented wkh Native American/Alaska Native stories or ex- 
amples to ensure cultural relevance. 

Holistic approaches include learning that organizes the curriculum 
around the students life, culture, and environment. Broad-theme subjects 
should be used, such as pollution or weather. American Indian/Alaska Native 
stories and legends, life experiences, and observations should be included 
in holistic curricula. Mathematics and science programs should draw 
existing knowledge and experiences within the community and culture to 
enhance the students' curricular experiences. 



Research regarding the attributes of effective 
instruction with \tnerican Indian/Alaska Na- 
tive students indicates that hands-on. inquiry 
based, cooperative learning and holistic learn- 
ing practices are appropriate approaches to 
effective classroom learning. 

■» ■»■»■» ■»■»■» 

All communities have different needs, and thus recognizing the diversity 
among American Indian/Alaska Native communities is necessary. Planners 
should use the community needs assessment as a guide for relevant local 
American Indian/Alaska Native cultural subjects, materials, methodology, 
and language utilization. Community guidance can help discard American 
Indian/Alaska Native stereotypes and misconceptions, as can inter-cultural 
sharing and exchanges with other communities. Accurate and factual 
information only should be used. By making students aware of their 
communities' needs and global perspectives, these are passed then onto the 
next generation. 

Although some of these above approaches differ significantly from 
current practices, they reflect the current reform movement. Because some 
of these approaches or areas of emphasis may be new in curriculum 
development, they also may be new to the students' experience. Conse- 
quently, leadership training is necessary in the implementation of curricula 
that adhere to these guidelines. Through this type of relevant curriculum 
American Indian/Alaska Native students may become future leaders in their 

i.8 15 



O Cwdelina Document 

ERIC 



communities, especially as they apply their science, mathematical, and 
technological abilities. 



In identifying role models and mentors, all community members who 
wish to share life experiences should be considered. Parents and family 
members are a part of students' education both in and out of the school 
setting. American Indian/Alaska Native individuals recognize the education 
of a whole person as one who is academically "smart" while also mentally, 
physically, and spiritually balanced, and in harmony with self and the 
environment. 

Guideline 2.4 - Use the following methods and sources to meet 
the cultural needs of students and communities: hands-on, inquiry- 
based learning; problem solving; cooperative group activities; commu- 
nity resources; and current technology. 



Applicable and current community needs can be used as hands-on, 
problem-solving exercises. Students should be made aware of these issues 
so they can work toward practical solutions to their communities' needs. A 
culturally appropriate example would be students researching and gather- 
ing water samples from a nearby river because their community needs to 
monitor and be aware of its water quality. By using the community itself as 
a teaching tool, practical, useful, and positive methods enhance the 
student's learning.

<■ ■» ~"» ■ » » « 

A holistic approach as mentioned previously is fundamental to effective 
curriculum for American Indian/Alaska Native students. Linear thought 
processing is only one way to learn or teach. Learning and teaching also can 
be accomplished through observation, experience, and exploration. For 
example, teachers can present complex issues and problems that do not 
have predetermined answers or solutions. 

Co-learning methods should also be used when possible. This allows for 
coaching and guiding, and deemphasi/es the teac her in a highly directive 
role. Croups of students should have a chance to participate through 
cooperative, nurturing, and communicable activities. Variety in the activi- 



16 



i J 



Cwdt'lii'ri Document 



ties also accommodates different learning styles and develop', 'espect for 
different styles. Planners also must keep in mind the students' maturity level. 
Developing self-awareness and personal confidence facilitates effective 
learning ind should become central to the curricular experences. 

Technology should be researched and evaluated before its implementa- 
tion. Cultural integrity must be maintained where current and emerging 
technology are used in the curriculum and community. Technology can be 
a very valuable tool in improving curricular experiences; however, if not 
used within the proper cultural context, it also can deter learning. Planners 
should conduct a community technological needs assessment prior to 
implementing technology in the community and school. 



Guideline 2.5 - Evaluate the curriculum in various ongoing ways 
including performance-based evaluation; comparison of the curricu- 
lum to the community goals; and tracking the implementation, impact, 
and outcomes of *he curriculum. 

A process of evaluation needs to be established as the curriculum is being 
developed and field tested. Procedures should include an: Implementation 
Evaluation (assessment of the project timelines), a Progress Evaluation 
(assessment of project objectives), and a Sunmative Evaluation (assessment 
of the impact of the project). Both qualitative and quantitative information 
should be gathered on all aspects of the project. 

The current level and status of the curriculum's accreditation needs must 
be recognized. However, in addition to the community and school's 
accreditation criteria and national or state accreditation demands, tribal 
and/or cultural standards must be met. 

Broad-based views in evaluating curricula look beyond grades and 
memorization to a more complete understanding of the sub- 
jects presented. Another aspect of appropriate evaluation 
is to ensure that students share or apply the information 
learned with their parents, community, or peers. Evalua- 
tion of curriculum should attempt to answer questions 
such as, did the curriculum meet the community's 
goals? did the curriculum qo beyond the classroom? ~ 
was the curriculum connected to the community? 

If the evaluation evolves naturally tium the community 
needs assessment in the curriculum development, American 
Indian, Alaska Native students have the best chance of learn- 
ing mathematics, science, and technology content and skills 
in a culturally relevant, inquiry-based, and c ooperative way.

enhancement can be summarized as follows: 

■ Training is not always available or provided to help teachers make their 
science, mathematics, and technology instruction culturally compat- 
ible with students' backgrounds and community needs. 

■ There is insufficient support for teacher enhancement programs that 
can help close the gap between teachers, students, and the Native 
American/Alaska Native community. 

■ Teacher preparation/enhancement programs do not use curricula 
relevant to students' background, culture, and experiences to improve 
their science, mathematics, and technology skills and knowledge. 

■ Teachers do not possess the skills and/or support necessary to create 
balance between native and modern scientific thought processes. 

■ Many teachers lack the knowledge or training necessary to prepare 
students for science, mathematics, and technology outside of the 
classroom. 

■ Teachers do not use a variety of inquiry-based, problem-solving teach- 
ing techniques in order to reach all students. 

■ Many teachers lack sufficient training to help students acquire informa- 
tion through methods most compatible with their preferred learning 
styles. 

■ Teachers are not provided sufficient opportunities to communicate 
their goals and strategies for facilitating science, mathematics, and 
technology education of American Indian/Alaska Native precolleg? 
students with their colleagues, parents, and the students themselves. 

■ Opportunities and financing for field trips supportive of the science and 
mathematics curricula are inadequate, and thus do not provide the 
experiences necessary to promote these areas, particularly for rural and 
reservation schools. 

■ Teachers are often uncomfortable teaching science, mathematics, and 
technology content because of their limited formal education and 
hands-on experiences in these areas. 

■ Teachers are not provided sufficient opportunities and follow-up in 
science, mathematics, and technology to remain current in these fields.

Figure 3: Critical factor* in teacher programs 

Issues such as lack of adequate preservice and inservice education, 
insufficient opportunities to remain current in mathematics, science, and 
technology, lack of school-community communication, and little use of 
hands-on, inquiry-based, cooperative learning all contribute to inadequate 
teaching skills and knowledge, and subsequent ineffective implementation 
of instruction in elementary and secondaryclassroomsfor American Indian/ 
Alaska Native students. These issues served is a reference in the generation 
of important factors to consider to ensure culturally relevant education. 

Figure 3 illustrates the conference partic ipants' concept web identifying 
the critical factors to consider when designing and implementing math- 
ematics, science, and technology programs for American Indian/Alaska 
Native precollege students and their educators. 




The participants also generated four guidelines reflecting these critical 
factors for effective teacher preparation and enhancement programs: 



Guideline 5.1 - Understand the culture of the American Indian/ 
Alaska Native students being educated. 

American Indian/Alaska Natives are divided into many cultures, clans, 
and societies. They practice many customs and lifestyles, maintain an 
enormous variety of values and beliefs, and speak numerous languages. 
Programs cannot categorize the diversity of cultures into a single entity or 
overlook the social and cultural diversity of American Indian/Alaska Natives 
for the sake of convenience or simplification. American Indian/Alaska 
Natives make up 1 % of the United States population and account for 50% 
of the country's diversity (Hodgkinson, 1990). Respect for and sensitivity 
to the local American Indian/Alaska Native population and community can 
be achieved through the development and implementation of cultural 
models and courses that are based on collaborative and meaningful input 

» « » <■ » ~» » » 

Once the needs-assessment has been completed 
and vital information has been ftuthereil, the 
curricula in science, mathematics and technol- 
ogy should be aliened to meet the community's 
needs. 

5 * * ■> ■> * * » 



of the local population. Ongoing dialogue with tribal members, orientation 
sessions that include discussion with tribal historians and elders, invitations 
to attend tribal social gatherings, and commitment to include community 
involvement are essential to an understanding from the local community. 
It is also important to bear in mind that for individuals to understand another 
culture, they must first understand their own and its relationship to the 
other. Teachers must evaluate themselves and their understanding of their 
own culture as a first step toward nderstanding another culture, and in 
incorporating that culture into their teaching and learning. 

Parental involvement in classrooms, on advisory boards and school 
boards, and as program role models, mentors, and consultants is essential. 
Program designs must be based on the needs of the local population, as 
schools make up only one part of the total edut ational prot ess for American 
Indian/AUuka Native precolleqe students. 



Q 20 



Cuu/t'/ini's Oou/ment 



Gutdeline 3.2 - Emphasize and integrate American Indian tradi- 
tional science, mathematics, and technological knowledge in class- 
room teaching. 

Once an understanding of culture occurs, traditional knowledge of science, 
mathematics, and technology can be further developed through community- 
based interactions among teachers, students, administrators, parents, and 
community members. Through this interaction American Indian// .aska Na- 
tive tribal language and culture can be incorporated into the curricula with 
proper support from appropriate adult Native Americans/Alaska Natives. 

As teachers strive to ensure cultural relevancy in their teaching, American 
Indian/Alaska Native lifestyles and their relationship with nature and prob- 
lem-solving techniques should serve as the foundations for effective study 
of science, mathematics, and technology. The historical and contemporary 
perspectives of science, mathematics, and technology as they relate to 
communities comprise an integral part of the education process. Through 
this interrelationship, education in these content areas becomes relevant to 
American Indian/Alaska Native precollege students. 



Guideline 3.3 - Become skilled in a variety of teaching/learning 
styles appropriate to American Indian/Alaska Native students, such as 
hands-on, inquiry- based learning; cooperative learning; use of tech- 
nology in teaching and learning; and problem-solving activities. 

Research regarding the attributes of effective instruction with American 
Indian/Alaska Native students indicates that hands-on, inquiry-based, coopera- 
tive learning and holistic learning practices are appropriate approaches to 
effective classroom learning (Cilliland, 1988). Incorporating a holistic teaching 
approach in the classroom promotes mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual 
well-being in an individual student. This is the foundation on which American 
Indian/Alaska Native people have based their societies for centuries. When used 
appropriately, these and similar methods help prepare students for both 
individual and cooperative group tasks. Further, the National Science Education 
Standards and the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics Standards 
emphasize these and similar approaches. However, such techniques must be 
coordinated with the local cultural and community needs to be most effective. 

To best use these approaches and implement the science and mathematics 
standards, teachers must he encouraged to identify and use resources outside 
the school environment (e.g., Internet), nurture a collaborative approach to 
work with the community (e g., school-community alliances), and also plan 
and implement professional growth and development strategies for them- 
selves and the community population.

Guideline 3.4 - Make science, mathematics, and technology j 
education relevant to American Indian/Alaska Native students by 
including community members and resources in teaching and learning. 

A primary barrier to American Indian/Alaska Native participation in 
science and mathematics is the lack of relevance to Indian lives and to their 
survival as a culture/community. Defining educational outcomes begins 
with parents, students, school personnel, and other stakeholders commu- 
nicating their needs and ideas with one another. Students must be prepared 
for success in two worlds: their specific society and the dominant society. As 
discussed previously, science and mathematics content must be consistent 
with the national standards. However, applications of science, mathemat- 
ics, and technology must incorporate both national standards curricula as 
well as local community knowledge and issues. Teachers must engage in 
continuous assessment methods that prepare students for standardized 
evaluations as well as classroom evaluations that are appropriate to their 
community's culture. To ensure appropriateness within one's culture and 
community, teachers should:

In actual practice in developing or implement- 
ing any one of these three program areas, one 
should consider guidelines from all three ureas 
since there is mu< h interconnectedness. 

~» <■ » » * » £ 

■ Integrate the backgrounds and experiences of students into lessons 

■ Utilize existing American Indian/Alaska Native curricula to enhance 
learning 

■ Use portfolio assessment to accurately reflect a student's science, 
mathematics, and technology understandings 

■ Inc jase science, mathematics, and technology relevancy to American 
Indians/Alaska Natives through experiences that foster a connection 
between classroom learning and actual application of that learning in 
the ( ommumty 

Community resources (including people) must be viewed as one of the 
best assets accessible to teachers of Americ an Indian/Alaska Native students. 
It is through these local resources that community-school alliances are 
formed, and the most relevant science, mathematic and technology 
education and use will occur.

CONCLUSION 



The foregoing guidelines and strategies address the various needs, issues, 
and barriers facing American Indian/Alaska Native precollege students in 
mathematics, science, and technology education. They are designed for 
educators and communities committed to providing exemplary and rel- 
evant student, curriculum, and teacher programs. These guidelines are 
adaptable to the needs of individual communities and schools and should 
be used with this in mind. 

The strategies identified represent only a sampling of those in practice. 
They do, however, represent a variety of programs known to be successful 
with American Indian/Alaska Native precollege students. 

These guidelines may also serve as a means to assess individual teaching 
practices and pedagogy. The "Suggested Resources" presented in Appen- 
dix C provide information on both practice and theory and will increase the 
knowledge base of educators concerned with science, mathematics and 
technology education for American Indian Alaska Native precollege stu- 
dents. 

Communities (students, parents, schools, businesses, etc.) may use these 
guidelines to serve as one means to view their own science, mathematics, 
and technology programs. The strategies may enhance existing programs 
or serve as a foundation to explore and build new ones, along with 
community-school partnerships. On a larger scale, funding agencies may 
use these guidelines to aid in their review of proposals in science, mathemat- 
ics, and technology, that purport to se^e American Indian Alaska Native 
precollege students. 

Ideally, this document, along with input from stakeholders at every level, 
will prove useful in the ongoing development and restructuring ot relevant 
and exemplary mathematics, science, and technology programs for Ameri- 
can Indian/Alaska Native precollege students, their teachers, and associated 
curriculum development. Further, it is the developers' hope that these 
guidelines will be used to ensure equity and excellence in science, math- 
ematics, and technology programs for American Indian Alaska Native 
elementary and secondary students and their educators,

CONFERENCE DESIGN, AGENDA, AND 
PARTICIPANT AFFILIATIONS 

This conference addressed three interrelated areas: teacher preparation, 
student programs, and curricula as they relate to community/cultural needs 
and issues in science, mathematics, and technology education for precollege 
American Indian/Alaska Native students. 

Input from American Indian/Alaska Native people is rarely sought when 
programs and projects are put into place. Often the needs of the American 
Indian/Alaska Native populations to be served are not adequately assessed, 
resulting in ineffective programs and frustration among stakeholders. This 
conference served as a channel to address the needs facing American 
Indian/Alaska Native precollege students in science, mathematics, and 
technology education, as expressed by American Indian/Alaska Native 
educators and community members from across the country as well as 
selected others involved in Indian education, 

Conference Design 

Conference participants included: a) principal investigators and/or their 
designees on existing National Science Foundation grants that were geared 
toward American Indian/Alaska Native precollege student progr ms, teacher 
programs, or curriculum development; b) other invited participants; c) a 
National Science Foundation representative; and d) American Indian Sci- 
ence and Engineering Society staff.

Conference participants elected to separate into three groups according 
to their expertise/project representation: teacher programs, student pro- 
grams, or curriculum development. This breakdown was determined nec- 
essary to ensure that cultural needs related to each area were discussed even 
though overlap exists. The groups were assigned a co-facilitator; however,

discussions occurred periodically throughout the day, and this is when ideas 
were shared and clarification was explored. 

As a result of this conference structure, guidelines were developed 
through collaborative discussions and group work sessions. Initial discus- 
sions centered on individual concerns and experiences with Native Ameri- 
can science, mathematics, and technology education. Issues were docu- 
mented using a concept-webbing procedure that involved identifying 
major areas related to each of the three topics: student programs, curricu- 
lum projects and teacher programs. The concept webs established the 
foundation for 'inking similar concerns and issues within topic groups. 
Periodic discussions with all conference participants ensured consensus on 
major issues and concerns as well as continued focus on the two conference 
goals.

APPENDIX B: 

REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE 

ON BARRIERS TO MATHEMATICS, 

SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION FOR 

AFRICAN INDIAN/ ALASKA NATIVE STUDENTS 

Recent reports document that high dropout rates and low academic 
achievement by American Indian students stem in part from a pervasive 
disregard for cultural relevancy in the education of American Indian stu- 
dents. In particular, positive early and middle school experiences in science 
and mathematics are essential to preparing young Indian people for science 
and engineering careers (Task Force, 1989) yet a review of the literature 
reveals barriers to such early positive experiences. 

Western versus Native View 

In contrast to the predominately mechanistic approach of Western 
science, the Indian view is "holistic in that it tries to present a comprehensive 
picture in which the parts and their value are less significant than the larger 
picture and its meaning." American Indian cultures do not accept the 
separation of science from other aspects of life, yet Indian students are 
presented with a curriculum in which "knowledge of theworid is divided up 
into separate categories that seem to be completely isolated from each 
other" (Deloria, 1991 p. 64). 

Expressions of a science thought process abound throughout traditional 
American Indian agriculture, astronomy, ecology, and medical practices. In 
addition, processes of science that include rational observation of natural 
events, classification, and problem solving are woven into all aspects of 
American Indian culture (Cajete, 1 986). Despite this intricate knowledge of 
the natural world, American Indian culture and traditions are often not 
included in curricula (Deloria, 1991). While mathematics was used in 
sophisticated ways by many ancient tribal cultures, only Western math- 
ematics history is treated in the classroom (Davison, 1992). 

Relevance 

Although most scientific knowledge today is passed on via textbooks and 
rote memorization, traditionally "Indian science was practical, involved a 
working knowledge of the environment, and was passed on to new 
generations via stories, games, and the experiences of daily life" (Taylor, 
1 988). An American Association for the Advancement of Sciences (1977)

Q 'tuidelines Document 31 



report stated :hat the primary barrier to American Indian participation in 
science was its lack of relevance to Indian lives and their survival as a culture. 
Yet even today it is still the rare case where one sees the integration of science 
and local culture in curricula. Even with this information there has been little 
movement to change over the last 20 years. 

~» ■» 4- ■» ■» ■» ■» 

Technology should he researched and evalu- 
ated before its implementation . Cultural integ- 
rity must he maintained where current and 
emerging technology are used in the curricu- 
lum and community. 

<■ ■» -fr ■» ■» 



In regards to mathematics, textbooks typically are written for white, 
middle-class American students and present mathematics as an essentially 
abstract subject (Davison, 1 992); teachers also typically present it as such. 
Mathematics is often not presented in a culturally relevant manner, using 
situations the students find interesting and familiar (Saxe, 1 982). Students 
see little or no use for the textbook-dominated mathematics they learn in 
school (Schindler & Davison, 1985), viewing the subject as devoid of 
meaning, just jargon and symbol manipulation. The result is mathematics 
underachievement, anxiety, and aversion (Maier, 1985). 

Learning Style 

The typical approach to classroom teaching has been based largely on a 
model of education that is teacher directed, employs indirect experience, 
verbal expression, and a linear approach to learning and thinking, and 
emphasizes the individual and competition (Pepper in Nelson, 1985). 
Research regarding the attributes of effective instruction with American 
Indian students indicates that hands-on, inquiry-based, and cooperative 
learning are most appropriate (Brendtro & Brokenleg, 1 993; Sawyer, 1 991 ). 
There is dissonance between the "watch me and do as I do" procedures used 
in most schools and the traditional Indian educational process of "watch me 
and try it when you feel comfortable with it" (Rhodes, 1990). 

Evidence from research and observation indicates that American Indian/ 
Alaska Native students usually do not respond to a verbal, abstract style of 
mathematics learning and prefer instead familiar tactile and visual stimuli 
(Davison, 1992). A verbal/abstract mode is often used when a visual/spatial/ 
perceptual mode would be more appropriate. The elementary mathemat- 

3 J 

? Cuidehnei Docjment 



ics curriculum normally deemphasizes geometry in favor of emphasis on 
numbers and related operations. Success in geometry is related to a 
kinesthetic processing of the environment, which is more attuned to the 
American Indian learning style (Davison, 1992). 

Institutional Barriers 

In reservation schools, turnover is high (Task Force, 1989). Teachers 
often lack adequate preparation, support, and delivery mechanisms (MSEB, 
1 990) and must use outdated materials and poor equipment. Many schools 
rely on tracking, a system that sorts students into achievers and under- 
achieves and erodes desire to excel in mathematics as well as science 
(MSEB, 1990). 

Lack of Role Models 

There are few positive American Indian role models in schools. Only six 
states have a minority student enrollment greater than 1 5% in their teacher 
education schools, colleges, and education departments. Out of every 400 
students enrolled in teacher education programs nationally, only two are 
American Indian (MSEB, 1990), and only a small percentage of these 
students goes on to teach mathematics and/or science. 

Psychological Dynamics 

The expectations from parents, teachers, and students themselves are 
low regarding mathematics and science. Lack of self-esteem and lack of self- 
confidence erode student interest and inadequate early preparation pre- 
vents students in high school and college from taking science and math- 
ematics courses (MSEB, 1990). 



Language 

When English is spoken in the 
home, or when an Indian-English 
dialect is spoken, classroom 
English is not reinforced out 
side the school. Even In- 
dian students who speak 
English may not under- 
stand the nuances of En- 
glish-language thinking 
(Davison, 1 992). Academic 
performance relates

heavily to language proficiency. Students must possess "deep structure" 
rather than "surface structure" language development in their first lan- 
guage to best learn a second language. 

Because of the differences in categorization and abstraction in American 
Indian languages, learning science becomes a problem of learning an 
entirely new specialized language (Schindler & Davison, 1 985). Students 
have difficulty extracting information from science texts due to the highly 
complex nature of the vocabulary, the organization of the text, the 
language structu-e, their literacy skills, and the study required for mastery 



Parental involvement in classrooms, an advi- 
sory boards and school boards, and on pro 
pram role models, mentors, and consultants is 
essential.

of the concepts. Students often cannot comprehend the material because 
of the terminology used and there may be many words unfamiliar to them. 
Often students recognize all the words and think they know meanings; 
however, a word may Save a dozen meanings and the students may know 
only one (Cilliland, 1 992). 

Often students are not given enough appropriate instruction in math- 
ematics vocabulary, For example, confusion occurs when such terms as 
"factor" and "product' have specialized meanings in the mathematics 
classroom different from their regular English language meaning. Students 
whose predominant language is not English have difficulty solving story 
problems in mathematics (Davison, 1992). 

In addition, many of the programs that target language-minority stu- 
dents suffer from the compensatory education stigma. Because students in 
compensatory education programs have low test scores in the "basics," 
including reading skills and language improvement, almost all attentions 
focused on impioving achievement in these areas. Other subjects, such as 
science, tend to be addressed incidentally and hapfwardly after the other 
work of the schoolday is done (DeAvila, 1985).

Cultural and Personal Sensitivities 

Particularly in the study of biology, cultural beliefs may make certain 
activities offensive to students. The killing of any animal or plant simply to 
be studied may be considered a sacrilege. Dissection is often explicitly 
forbidden due to the prohibition against touching the dead. Certain 
animals are considered to have special powers and to discuss them may be 
considered to bring harmful consequences (Cilliland, 1992; Levy, 1992). 

As shewn in the discussion above, a clear need exists for educators to 
identify guidelines for the development and use of culturally relevant 
strategies and materials for American Indian/Alaska Native precollege 
students in mathematics, science, and technology. Hodgkinson et al. 
(1990) wrote that American Indians "should be more in control of their 
future by having more control over their children's education" (p. 21). 
Effective education for American Indians must have a holistic approach that 
includes all those involved in the educational process— students, educators, 
and the communities themselves. 

This conference continued the process of identifying cultural concerns 
and issues within teacher enhancement, student, and curriculum develop- 
ment programs. It also provided educators the opportunity to develop a 
recommended set of guidelines that reflect cultural and community needs 
associated with mathematics, science, and technology education for 
precollege American Indian students.
