It is a loss to American literature that so much of the legendary history of these 
Indian tribes has gone, beyond hope of recovery. Exquisite in color, poetical in 
feeling, these legends of sun, moon, and stars, of snow, ice, lightning, thunders, 
the winds, the life of the forest birds and animals about them, and the longing to 
understand the why and the how of life — all which we have only in 
fragments. . .. These tales come from the following tribes: Winnebago, 
Chitimacha, Wyandot, Biloxi, Ojibwa, Mandan, Menomini, Cherokee, Sioux, 
Knisteneaux, Choctaw (Bayou Lacomb), Fox, and Natchez.
