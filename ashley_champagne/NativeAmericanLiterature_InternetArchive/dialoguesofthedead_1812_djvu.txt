Can the dead of different ages and spaces meet in the afterlife? This is a thought that has 
occupied a number of writers throughout literature, George Lyttleton being one of them. He 
allows Plato to discourse with Fenelon, allows a native American warrior to explain the 
barbarity of the custom of duels among gentlemen to a victim of such a duel, and he has 
William Penn clash with Fernando Cortez over Cortez's cruelty in Mexico. The characters of 
the conversations are as different as the subjects, drawing not only on Lyttleton's rich historical 
knowledge, but also on his experience as a statesman. - Summary by Carolin
