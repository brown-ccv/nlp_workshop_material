ABSTRACT 



This chapter draws on an extensive literature review to 
examine factors that influence the access and achievement of American Indians 
and Alaska Natives in higher education. American Indians are less likely to 
attend college than other U.S. ethnic groups. This underrepresentation is 
partly due to precollege attributes: low scores on college admissions tests, 
relatively low completion of high school core curriculum requirements, and 
failure to meet other college admissions criteria. Other, perhaps more 
important, influences on American Indian postsecondary access are school and 
environmental attributes: lack of qualified Native educators, lack of 
culturally relevant curriculum, poverty, and family problems. Once in 
college, American Indians are more likely than other students to attend a 
2 -year college and are underrepresented among those who have completed a 
bachelor's degree. Native graduation and persistence rates are also 
consistently lower than those of the general student population. To promote 
satisfactory transition from high school to college, governments and colleges 
must promote K-16 partnerships with tribal communities to elevate the overall 
level of precollege academic preparation and postsecondary aspirations of 
American Indian students. Culturally-specif ic academic and student support 
services, mentoring programs, and sufficient financial aid are needed once 
the student gets into college. Tribal colleges are exemplary in developing 
recruitment, retention, and supportive campus environments, and many 
non- Indian institutions have also strived to meet the needs of Native 
students and communities. Contains tables, and endnotes and 71 references.

American Indians and Alaska Natives 
in Higher Education 

Promoting Access and Achievement 

D. Michael Pavel 1 



A merican Indian and Alaska Native people are deeply con- 
cerned with postsecondary access and achievement, and they 
are not alone. 2 Improving American Indian access to and 
achievement in higher education is part of a national agenda to 
diversify our colleges and universities 3 and is supported by specific 
initiatives intended to serve the Native community. 4 Overall, the 
higher education community and the general public must continue 
to address a legacy of American Indian underrepresentation in higher 
education as our society strives to move closer to developing demo- 
cratic and integrated multicultural colleges and universities. By do- 
ing so, we as a nation strengthen ourselves to confront the social, 
cultural, and economic issues that affect all our lives. 

To address these issues over time, it is important to determine 
periodically how well American Indians are gaining access to and 
achieving in the postsecondary arena. This chapter draws upon ex- 
tensive literature including a national study describing the charac- 
teristics of American Indian K-12 education 5 and a source book on

American Indians in higher education that examines demographics, 
access, enrollment, degrees conferred, financial aid, faculty repre- 
sentation, tribal colleges, and policy implications. 6 

The chapter begins with an overview of American Indian access to 
higher education, presenting data on precollege attributes such as 
admission test scores, core curriculum course completion, and col- 
lege admissions criteria. This collection of precollege attribute data 
is balanced by an examination of the possible influences of school 
and environmental attributes on postsecondary access. American 
Indian achievement in higher education is examined using national 
data on enrollment and degrees conferred, in addition to persistence 
and graduation rates at various types of institutions by size and 
source of control. The chapter reviews the literature to identify 
actions that promote American Indian achievement in higher educa- 
tion and concludes with comments on an overall strategy to improve 
American Indian postsecondary access and achievement. 



Access to Higher Education 

The National Educational Longitudinal Study (NELS:88) of eighth- 
grade students, which began in 1988, found that American Indians 
are less likely to be college bound than other prominent groups in 
the United States. For example, while American Indians represented 
0.8 percent of the total sample, only 0.4 percent were college bound; 
among White (non-Hispanic) students, who represented 74 percent 
of the total sample, 80 percent were college bound. Myriad reasons 
exist for this discrepancy. This section examines precollege attributes 
of American Indian students in tandem with school and environ- 
mental attributes to understand better the factors that influence 
movement from high school to college. 



Precollege attributes. College admission test scores, core cur- 
riculum course completion, and the proportion of students meeting 
certain college admissions criteria provide some insight into higher 
education access issues for American Indians. Two predominant 
college admission tests administered to precollege students are the 
Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) and the American CollegeTest (ACT). 
As shown in Table 1, overall scores among American Indians gener- 
ally lag behind the nation in both tests. Although scores rose be- 
tween 1987 and 1997, on average, American Indians consistently

were 74 to 66 points lower on the combined verbal and mathematical 
SAT scores and 2.0 to 2.2 points lower than the ACT national aver- 
age.

American Indian students also appear to rank below the U.S. 
average in completion of core curricula for high school graduation. 
As shown in Table 2, only 26 percent of the American Indians did so 
in 1990 and 31 percent in 1992. This compares to 40 percent of the 
total U.S. population in 1990 and 47 percent in 1992. While the 
percentage of American Indian students completing a core curricu- 
lum increased by 5 percent between the two periods, these increases 
are still 14 to 16 percent lower than the total sample. 

Additional analysis of NELS:88 data indicates that most Ameri- 
can Indian college-bound high school graduates do not meet any of 
the five specific criteria identified as being important to college 
admissions officers. For example, only 5 percent of the American 
Indians had a grade point average of 3.5, compared to 19 percent of 
the students nationwide. Just 2 percent of the American Indians had

a combined SAT of 1,100 or better, compared to 22 percent of all 
college-bound high school graduates. Approximately 25 percent of 
the American Indians received positive teacher responses to a series 
of survey questions, compared to 42 percent of all students. About 
58 percent of the American Indian students did participate in two or 
more extracurricular activities; however, this compares to 68 per- 
cent of the total sample. The analysis also reveals that only 24 
percent of the American Indian high school graduates completed a 
college preparation curriculum, compared to 56 percent of all col- 
lege-bound high school graduates in the sample. 

At first glance, per-college attribute data reveal some gains, but 
they still suggest an inability of American Indian students to perform 
well on standardized tests and to meet important admission criteria. 
It is not surprising that they are underrepresented in the higher 
education arena, which relies on test scores and academically related 
criteria to screen access and predict success. The problem could, 
then, be fixed if we got American Indians to do better on standard- 
ized tests and to meet important admission criteria that we expect of 
all Americans. 

While attractive on a surface level, the strategy of simply “fixing 
the American Indian” is unacceptable. This personal-deficit approach 
does not adequately address the overall complexity of issues that 
conspire to undermine attempts by American Indians to gain access 
to postsecondary institutions. Evidence suggests college test scores 
and academic criteria such as high school grade point averages are 
not powerful predictors of college success among American Indi- 
ans. 9 Although it can be helpful to consider such factors, it is still 
necessary to broaden our scope to include appropriate attributes at 
the heart of preparing American Indian students for pursuing a 
higher education degree. Better indicators of success would be the 
school and environmental attributes that determine the quality of 
schooling American Indians receive throughout their K-12 experi- 
ence. 

School and environmental attributes. A 1997 report, which 
uses American Indian data collected through the Schools and Staff- 
ing Survey (SASS), provides another vantage point for examining 
school and environmental attributes that might influence 
postsecondary access among American Indian students. 10 SASS is 




i~m

an integrated survey of American schools, school districts, princi- 
pals, teachers, and student records that includes an oversample of 
schools funded or operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) 
and public schools with high percentages of Indian student enroll- 
ment. The SASS database is unique because characterizing the na- 
tional extent of education services received by American Indian 
students is not easy and is rarely attempted. 

The small size of the American Indian population (approximately 
one percent of the U.S. population) has meant that these students 
and the school personnel who serve them are almost never repre- 
sented in sufficient numbers in national education studies to permit 
reliable and valid generalizations about their characteristics. Fur- 
thermore, tribal and linguistic diversity, geographic dispersion, and 
the tendency of American Indians to reside in remote rural areas 
have made national studies of this population very costly and beyond 
the reach of most education researchers. However, the Indian supple- 
ment to the ongoing SASS data collection program represents an 
important effort by the U.S. Department of Education to explain to 
educators and policy makers many of the issues that confront the 
schools, administrators, and teachers serving American Indian stu- 
dents. 

Using SASS data, a recent study finds that 10 percent of all Ameri- 
can Indian students attend schools funded or operated by the Bu- 
reau of Indian Affairs (hereafter referred to as BIA/tribal schools) 
and that 36 percent attend public schools where American Indians 
constitute 25 percent or more of the total student enrollment (here- 
after referred to ashigh-Indian-enrollment public schools)." Nearly 
all of these schools are small (less than 500 students) and located in 
rural areas of the United States. This combination of school size and 
location presents unique challenges when examining postsecondary 
access issues. For example, educational costs per student are typi- 
cally higher for rural schools, prohibiting the implementation of 
advanced or college preparatory classes, while economic and social 
features such as poverty and low educational attainment among 
adults may contribute to students not achieving their academic po- 
tential. However, small schools also offer potential benefits not en- 
joyed by larger institutions. Studies conclude that drop-out rates are 
lower, teaching is more effective, and fewer behavior problems arise 
in smaller schools. 12

The quality of students’ high school experiences that cultivate 
postsecondary aspirations and intentions is determined, in large 
part, by the learning environment that principals and teachers are 
instrumental in creating. As noted by the Indian Nations At Risk 
Task Force and White House Conference on Indian Education, a 
critical need exists to increase the number of qualified American 
Indian administrators and teachers who can serve as positive role 
models and who possess knowledge of Indian traditions, cultures, 
and learning styles. In the 1993-94 school year, only 47 percent of 
the principals in BIA/tribal schools (where nearly all students are 
American Indians) and just 13 percent of the principals in high- 
Indian-enrollment public schools were American Indians. Sixty-six 
percent of the BIA principals and 29 percent of the public school 
principals had received training in Indian education administration. 
Such training could enhance program development and community 
relationships designed to meet the needs of American Indian stu- 
dents. Only 38 percent of the teachers in BIA/tribal schools and 15 
percent of the teachers in high-Indian-enrollment public schools 
were American Indians; nationally very few teachers reported they 
had majored or minored in Indian education (0.05 percent), and 
even in BIA/tribal schools, only 2 percent held a college major or 
minor in this area. 

The serious issues facing schools in which American Indians con- 
stitute a significant percentage of the student body can provide 
additional insights into learning environments. More than 40 per- 
cent of all principals and teachers in BIA/tribal schools and high- 
Indian-enrollment public schools reported that poverty was a seri- 
ous problem in their communities. Poverty and the associated lack of 
social services in rural areas probably contributed to additional 
problems identified as serious (parental alcohol and drug abuse, lack 
of parental involvement, student absenteeism, and student apathy) 
by 25 to 40 percent of principals and teachers. These statistics are 
not indictments, but too many resonate throughout Indian country 
for us to ignore the important and far-reaching impact that good 
schools and educated youth can have upon our communities. 





American Indians and Alaska Natives in Higher Education 

Achievement in Higher Education 

This section examines postsecondary enrollment, degrees con- 
ferred, and graduation and persistence rates at various types of 
institutions, and presents findings that promote campus climates 
conducive to American Indian achievement in higher education. 
American Indians appear less likely to enroll in four-year institu- 
tions compared to the national norm. As shown in Table 3, between 
1993 and 1995, the percentage of American Indians enrolled in 
public and private four-year institutions ranged from 48.1 to 50.0 
percent; enrollment in public and private two-year institutions ranged 
from 50.0 to 51.9 percent. However, the national norm favored 
enrollment in four-year over two-year institutions, with approxi- 
mately 61 percent attending four-year schools. These findings sug- 
gest American Indians are not on parity with the rest of the nation in 
achieving enrollment in four-year degree institutions that may pro- 
vide better opportunities for employment and graduate education.

As shown in Table 4, American Indians also are underrepresented 
among those who have completed a bachelor’s degree program; of 
the total number of bachelors degrees awarded in 1994-95, only 0.6 
percent were awarded to American Indians. A longitudinal study of 
American Indians who were high school sophomores in 1980 found 
58 percent eventually completed high school while only 7 percent 
received a bachelor’s degree; 0.5 percent had obtained a master s 
degree by 1992. Among a sample of American Indian students in a 
longitudinal study of beginning postsecondary students who en- 
rolled for the first time in 1989-90, only 16 percent had received a 
bachelor’s degree by spring 1994 (28 percent were not enrolled and 
had no degree).

Graduation and persistence rates. Graduation and persis- 
tence rates give some indication of how well American Indians are 
achieving in higher education. 15 A 1996 study by the National Colle- 
giate Athletic Association (NCAA) found that about 35 percent of the 
American Indians who entered as first-time, full-time freshmen 
graduated within six years. As shown in Table 5, graduation rates at 
NCAA Division I schools vary depending on size and control. The 
lowest percentage of American Indians graduating within six years is 
at small public institutions (25 percent in 1995 and 28 percent in 
1996); the highest graduation rate occurs in large private institu- 
tions (56 percent). Overall, American Indian students are far less 
likely to graduate in six years as compared to the general student 
population.

As shown in Table 6, the one-year persistence rate at Division II 
public institutions for first-time, full-time American Indian fresh- 
men was 54 percent for the 1993-94 cohort; the three-year persis- 
tence rate was 33 percent for the 1991-92 cohort. These rates were 14 
to 16 percent lower than the total average. The one- and three-year 
persistence rates at Division II private institutions for first-time, 
full-time American Indian freshmen were similar (56 percent and 33 
percent, respectively) but 17 and 21 percent lower than the total 
average. 

First-time, full-time American Indian freshmen appear to fare 
better at Division III institutions, with one- and three-year persis- 
tence rates at public institutions being 64 percent and 46 percent, 
respectively, and slightly higher at private institutions, with a one- 
year persistence rate of 69 percent and a three-year persistence rate 
of 49 percent. However, American Indian one- and three-year per- 
sistence rates at public Division III institutions were still 12 and 14 
percent lower than the average of the total sample, and at private 
institutions, the rates were 12 and 18 percent lower. 

Promoting postsecondary achievement. Higher education 
institutions can make a wide variety of interrelated efforts to im- 
prove American Indian postsecondary achievement. On one hand, 
the federal government is an instrumental partner in increasing 
American Indian postsecondary achievement because of treaty obli- 
gations. On the other hand, it is up to the tribes, states, and institu- 
tions within those states to sustain worthwhile efforts that will result 
in measurable improvements. 18

To promote satisfactory transition from high school to college, 
state governments and postsecondary institutions need to promote 
K-16 partnerships with tribal communities to elevate the overall 
level of precollege academic preparation, postsecondary aspirations, 
and postsecondary orientation of American Indian students. A na- 
tional assessment of American Indian postsecondary departure is in 
agreement, finding that weak postsecondary intentions and the lack 
of ability to integrate social and academic systems both formally and 
informally, into the college campus, adversely influence postsec- 
ondary outcomes. 19 

In response, both the Indian Nations At Risk Task Force and the 
National Advisory Council on Indian Education received testimony 
requesting resources to help American Indians become more aware 
of postsecondary opportunities and better prepared for the aca- 
demic and social rigors of attending college. Culturally specific aca- 
demic and student support services are needed once the student gets 
into college. 20 If services are provided, it is important to ensure that 
American Indians use and are satisfied with these services, 21 hope- 
fully reducing their anxiety levels enough to find comfortable niches 
on campus. 22 

Mentoring programs and sufficient financial aid should be made 
available to American Indian students at postsecondary institutions. 
The institution should blend linear and holistic thinking within the

classroom. At the same time, the campus community can look be- 
yond overt racism and discrimination in a more concerted effort to 
motivate students to put forth the effort needed to succeed. Institu- 
tional policies to improve American Indian postsecondary achieve- 
ment should spell out the need for multicultural and relevant educa- 
tion that spawns reciprocity in faculty-student interactions . 23 To 
improve outcomes for American Indian students, institutions of 
higher education have to cultivate enduring academic advisor-advisee 
and intellectual mentor-mentee relationships. These faculty-student 
relationships should be characterized by caring attitudes conveyed 
through good communication skills, likable personalities, a willing- 
ness to learn cultural norms, respectful interactions, appreciation 
for different ways of knowing, and high expectations . 24 

Some colleges and universities have already responded to the 
challenge of improving American Indian access and achievement in 
higher education . 25 Tribal colleges, in particular, are exemplary in 
developing recruitment, retention, and campus environments that 
facilitate American Indian student achievement . 26 Paul Boyer’s re- 
port on the tribal colleges finds that “research, site visits, accredita- 
tion reports, and government audits all confirm their effectiveness. 
Tribal colleges have proven their ability to enroll students who were 
not served by higher education, to graduate students who have 
dropped out of other institutions, and to sponsor successful commu- 
nity development programs .” 27 

Another study demonstrates that tribal college personnel know 
and readily accept their roles in serving a wide variety of needs 
within the community . 28 The expanded nature of this target popula- 
tion results in programming designed to reach the populations that 
need to be served. The service population includes students with a 
wide variety of characteristics: learning disabilities, low academic 
confidence, a desire but inability (due to conflicting demands) to 
make contact with college staff, the initiative to take advantage of 
services offered by the college to further their education, the need to 
participate in training and workshops, interest in one or two particu- 
lar courses, and aspirations and commitment to obtain a college 
degree. 

On the reservation, being able to initiate a conversation with 
somebody who is functionally illiterate is as meaningful to the tribal 
college staff as being able to clarify a program of study for a student 



D. Michael Pavel 



who enrolls in a degree program. Although this may not be reflected 
in institutional enrollment records, tribal college staff nonetheless 
gain a deep sense of personal satisfaction when reaching out to serve 
people in need, regardless of the need. Whether a person needs 
somebody to read something to them or guidance on how to get fully 
enrolled in a degree program, access is promoted and achieved by 
tribal college personnel. Faculty and staff in these institutions are 
impressive in that they care about, encourage, and attend to the 
developmental needs of students and their families in such a way 
that it becomes institutionalized and personalized. This spirit of 
giving provides fertile ground for a growing sense of optimism among 
tribal members. 

Many non-Indian institutions have also strived to meet the needs 
of tribal communities and American Indian college students. Early 
outreach by these institutions evolves into long-term relationships 
with secondary schools and tribal communities. Often the number of 
alumni from particular tribal communities increases, and alumni 
play a vital role in promoting student and faculty organizations that 
advance the institution’s mission to serve American Indian students 
and communities. Beneficial activities include academic programs 
and student support services that provide employment opportuni- 
ties; grant support; technical support; culturally sensitive counsel- 
ing; cultural support networks; scholarly opportunities; and the 
chance to interact with faculty about substantive issues regarding 
American Indians past, present, and future. Exemplary institutions 
try to establish family relationships with the American Indian people. 

Important strides are being made to address the needs of Ameri- 
can Indians in different disciplines. In the field of education, various 
observers have called for learning about American Indian students 
and families through immersion into and experience with communi- 
ties ; 29 creation of nontraditional admissions policies and instruc- 
tional delivery ; 30 work with tribal governments ; 31 and emphasis on 
hiring knowledgeable personnel and providing professional devel- 
opment . 32 Institutions like Haskell Indian Nations University and 
Dine College have developed programs that use the best practices in 
teacher education and incorporate valuable knowledge about Indian 
education, learning styles, and culturally appropriate curricular ma- 
terials . 33 



American Indians and Alaska Natives in Higher Education 




However, teacher education is not alone in showing growth in 
positive outcomes for American Indian students. Programs in psy- 
chology recruit and retain promising students through culturally 
appropriate, sensitive programs and outreach 34 and develop rel- 
evant curricula complemented by job placement services . 35 Business 
programs are beginning to see the value of working with tribal 
economic development strategies . 36 The science, mathematics, and 
engineering fields have become more familiar with specific needs 
among American Indians , 37 assessing enrollment and completion 
trends , 38 and offering summer institutes and undergraduate and 
graduate research/support programs . 39 

Conclusion 

As we embark upon each school year, concerned educators should 
review American Indian access to and achievement in higher educa- 
tion. Improvement in these areas will require federal, state, and 
tribal governments to collaborate on an agenda to increase the num- 
ber of American Indian students who enter into and graduate from 
college. Several initiatives can arise from such collaboration: part- 
nerships that link schools serving American Indians to businesses so 
students can explore and get training in various career opportuni- 
ties, schools that work with tribal communities to increase parental 
involvement and community empowerment in determining the mis- 
sion and scope of the school, and higher education communities that 
collaborate with American Indian communities to address barriers 
to advancing the postsecondary recruitment and retention of Ameri- 
can Indian students. 

Schools and postsecondary institutions have established policies 
that clearly articulate a commitment to meet the intellectual and 
cultural needs of American Indian students. Academic disciplines 
have been successful in creating comfortable academic and social 
environments while reaching out to tribal communities to find out 
what needs to be addressed and increasing the pool of prospective 
American Indian applicants. Within the big picture, all these initia- 
tives (small and large) are brought together by a level of sincerity and 
commitment that strives to fundamentally change the education 
system to better meet the needs of all American citizens, including 
American Indians.
