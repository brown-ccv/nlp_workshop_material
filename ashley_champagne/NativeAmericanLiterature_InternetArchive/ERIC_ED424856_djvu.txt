ABSTRACT 



This study used content analysis to investigate the change, 
over time, in the depiction of Alaskan natives in children's fiction. The 
analysis was based on four broad categories: (1) physical traits, including 

physical features and types of clothing; (2) social traits, including 
language fluency, family associations, amount of formal education, types of 
occupations , and relationships with non- Alaskan natives; (3) cultural traits, 
including kinds of foods, types of tools and utensils, means of 
transportation, types of dwellings, and predominant social concern; and (4) 
story elements, including book genre, age and sex of the main character, 
setting, and predominant theme. The sample included 79 children's picture 
books and chapter books published between 1902 and 1994. Results showed that 
Alaskan natives were most frequently represented as dark-haired, dark-eyed 
Eskimos wearing fur coats and boots, who lived with their families in the 
wilderness and traveled by dogsled. The majority of the characters were shown 
living a traditional subsistence lifestyle, using traditional tools and 
utensils, and eating traditional foods. Each of the three native 
groups- -Aleuts, Eskimos, and Indians --were represented, though not in 
proportion to the population. Two appendices contain the coding sheet and 34 
data tables. (Contains 35 references.) (DLS)

ABSTRACT 



Books have the potential to build respect across 
cultures, to point out universal characteristics of all 
people, and to reinforce the self esteem of minority group 
members. Alaskan Natives are changing from a subsistence 
lifestyle to a market economy lifestyle. Content analysis 
was used to investigate the change, over time, in the 
depiction of the Alaskan natives. 

The analysis was based on four broad categories: 

(1) physical traits which included physical features and 
types of clothing; (2) social traits which included language 
fluency, family associations, amount of formal education, 
types of occupations, and relationships with non-Alaskan 
natives; (3) cultural traits which included kinds of foods, 
types of tools and utensils, means of transportation, types 
of dwellings and predominant social concern; and (4) story 
elements which included book genre, age and sex of the main 
character, setting, and predominant theme. The sample 
included 79 children’s contemporary and historical picture 
books and contemporary and historical chapter books 
published between 1902 and 1904.

CHAPTER 1 
INTRODUCTION 

The September 11, 1965, issue of Saturday Review 

published "The All-White World of Children’s Books," in 
which Nancy Larrick criticized the lack of Black characters 
in children’s trade books. She noted that the few books 
which included black characters portrayed them in 
stereotypical ways. Her statements have been cited in 
several succeeding articles concerning the portrayal of 
different ethnic groups in children’s books (Latimer 1975, 
Norton 1991, Reimer 1992). Behind these discussions is the 
belief that books have the potential to build respect across 
cultures, to point out universal characteristics of all 
people, and to reinforce the self esteem of minority group 
members (Bekkedal 1973, 124; Fisher 1974, 189; Norton 1991, 
530 ) . 

In the 1970s, a number of essay articles and annotated 
bibliographies discussing the treatment of American Indians 
in literature, particularly children’s literature, were 
published (Byler 1973, Fisher 1974, Herbst 1975, Schafstall 
and Francois 1978, Lass-Woodfin 1978, Stensland 1979).

Three-fourths of the children’s stories discussed in the 

above articles and bibliographies were about stereotyped 

American Indians in historical settings, and one— fourth of 

the titles dealt with American Indians in contemporary 

settings (Fisher 1974, 185). Laura Herbst (1975) reviewed 

children’s books with American Indian characters, some of 

which had been highly recommended in the past. She 

concluded that the books she examined "contribute nothing to 

the respect for the Indian and his culture nor . . . treat 

him in either a realistic, just, or sympathetic manner" 

(Herbst 1975, 197). Two of the four bibliographies 

published during this decade included guides for choosing 

books about American Indians ( Lass-Woodf in 1978, and 

Stensland 1979). Mary Gloyne Byler examined over six 

hundred children’s books for the Association of American 

Indian Affairs. She felt there had been too many books 

written about American Indians because most of the books 

were filled with the whooping Indian or the incompetent 

Indian stereotype. Byler ended the introduction to her 

compilation of books with the statement that 

only American Indians can tell non-Indians what it is to 
be Indian. There is no longer any need for non-Indian 
writers to "interpret" American Indians for the American 
public (Byler 1973, 11). 

The same debates that occurred in the 1970 ’s articles 
were deliberated again the journals of the 1980s (May 1983, 
Moore and MacCann 1988, Carver 1988). These authors were 
citing the articles of the previous decade. They concluded 
that things had not changed very much. Unfortunately, 

2 

11 



Carver (1988) felt that the majority of stereotyped American 
Indians were to be found in books for younger children. 
Arlene Hirschfelder (1982) collected articles written in the 



1960s and 1970s for a book which focussed on American Indian 
stereotypes. She hoped this would bring about change. 

The discussion of American Indian depiction in 
children’s literature continues into the 1990s (Kuipers 
1991, Slapin and Seale 1992, Reimer 1992, Kruse 1992, 
Caldwell-Wood 1992). Emphasis is now being placed on the 
need for reviewers and selectors of children’s multicultural 
literature to become familiar with other cultures by 
reading, widely, books written by members of those cultures 
(Kruse 1992, 33). Again, there is an appeal for minority 

authors to share their stories and for publishers to publish 
these works (Reimer 1992). Naomi Caldwell-Wood, former 
president of the American Indian Library Association, states 
that ’’most of the materials available from major publishers 
about Native Americans has been written, illustrated, and 
edited by non-Indians” (Caldwell-Wood 1992, 47). Two 
annotated bibliographies have been published (Kuipers 1991, 
Slapin and Seale 1992). Both offer detailed guides to the 
selection of books about American Indians. 

This researcher has lived in Alaska almost thirty years 
and has been on both sides of the stereotyped American 
Indian issue. She remembers asking her hosts during her 
initial visit to the state if many Eskimos lived in the 
Anchorage area. She was very surprised to learn that the 
original people of Alaska were called Alaskan natives

and 



were divided into three major groups: Eskimos (Inuit and 

Yupik), Aleuts, and Indians (Athabascan, Tlingit, Haida, and 
Tsimshian). Since that day, she has explained these facts 
many times to her guests from the Outside (lower forty-eight 
states). In addition, she has also apprised them of the 
fact that Canadian Eskimos used igloos, not Alaskan Eskimos. 
Even today, nonfiction children’s books about Eskimos do not 
distinguish between the Alaskan and the Canadian Eskimo. 

Reading the debates of the last twenty-five years 
concerning the portrayal of American Indians in children’s 
literature raises the question of whether the representation 
of Alaskan natives in picture books and chapter fiction 
books has changed over time. In 1971, the Alaska Native 
Claims Settlement Act was passed, and the Alaskan natives 
became shareholders in village and regional corporations 
which control forty-four million acres of land and almost 
one billion dollars (Drew 1991,1992). This was a major 
change from a subsistence lifestyle to one of business. The 
change has not been easy. One wonders if any of this change 
and its related problems have been portrayed in children’s 
literature. In 1973, Bekkedal recommended research of this 
nature when she wrote that " it would be helpful to know not 
only if the proportion of characters representing . . . 

minorities increased but how the descriptions of them 
changed” (Bekkedal 1973, 124). Children need literature 
that accurately reflects their life.

CHAPTER 2 



REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE 



A number of research studies have looked at the 
treatment of American Indians during the past twenty-five 
years. These studies differ from the previously described 
articles in that the authors made a careful, systematic 
examination of the contents of a defined population of 
books. Eleven studies will be discussed. Two studies 
looked at the treatment of several minority groups in 
children’s literature. Only the findings related to 
American Indians will be highlighted in this review. Six 
studies examined the treatment of American Indians in 
children’s literature or young adult literature. One study 
analyzed history textbooks, and one study looked at teacher 
perceptions of American Indian stereotypes in children’s 
literature . 

In 1965, Gast investigated five minority groups: 
American Indians, Chinese, Japanese, Negroes, and Spanish- 
Americans. He looked at all children’s fiction for 
kindergarten through grade eight reading levels set between 
1945 and 1962. The population consisted of forty-two books. 



5 




He noted that only twelve books in his study were about 



contemporary American Indians. Seven categories were used 
for character analysis including the Katz and Braly List of 
Verbal Stereotypes. In addition, Gast looked at each book 
as a whole for explicit and implicit concepts concerning 
American Indians. He found that the American Indians were 
portrayed in both traditional and modern clothes and lived 
in lower socio-economic conditions. A new stereotype was 
found: all of the groups seemed to have adopted, to a 

certain extent, the middle class values of kindness, 
conventionality, intelligence, neatness, and ambition. The 
books did not have non-compl imentary stereotypes nor did 
they treat being a minority as a social problem. 
Similarities between minority and majority Americans seemed 
to be emphasized (Gast 1966). 

In 1973, Falkenhagen and Kelly asked teachers to 
identify American Indian stereotypes they would expect to 
find in children’s trade books. The teachers felt American 
Indians would be stereotyped by being consistently dressed 
in traditional clothes, by being shown as always living in 
tepees or hogans , and by having their culture 
oversimplified. These responses were compared to Gast’s 
findings in the previously cited research and to 
Faldenhagen ’ s own findings in her unpublished Master’s 
paper. Both researchers concluded that dress stereotypes 
were no longer in the current books. Falkenhagen stated 
that while American Indians no longer appeared to be 
dwelling only in hogans or teepees, as the teachers 



6 



suggested, the American Indians were still in the low 
socio-economic class. There were stereotypes of American 
Indian culture but they were more subtle than the ones the 
teachers expected. Falkenhagen and Kelly concluded that the 
teachers were unaware that explicit stereotyping is not 
generally found in current children’s literature 
(Falkenhagen and Kelly 1974). 

Napier considered twenty historical fiction, realistic 
fiction, and biography books. These were selected from a 
group of forty-seven recommended books. She used three 
categories in her analysis: physical description, language, 

and status. Physical description was subdivided into age, 
gender, and actual description. Fluency and grammatical ity 
were analyzed in the language category. Status was 
separated into five areas: family or group affiliation, 

special talent or skills, and community’s reaction to 
character. She concluded that American Indians were 
portrayed as physically attractive, as fluently using 
language, and as living in non-contemporary times (Napier 
1970 ) . 

Troy compared two generations of American Indian 
depiction in young adult novels. She analyzed how much and 
what kind of American Indian information an adolescent could 
acquire as a result of reading these novels. A sample of 
twenty-two books was chosen: nine published between 1930 

and 1940 and thirteen published between 1960 and 1970. Troy 
looked at tribes, setting, economy, physical appearance, 
dress, housing, customs, religion, and savagery. She 



7 




found that American Indians were usually portrayed in 



historical settings in both samples of books. Dress, 
dwellings, and weapons were non-contemporary. Hunting and 
fishing were the main occupations. American Indians in the 
1930s used broken English but in the 1960s, they were more 
fluent. A racially mixed American Indian was treated 
positively in the 1930s but this was not necessarily true in 
the 1960s. Males were more important than females in both 
groups (Troy 1975). 

Clemmer studied the characterization of the American 
Indian in nineteen randomly selected United States history 
textbooks that were on Utah’s 1950-1977 adoption list. She 
looked for omissions as well as distortions. The books were 
scrutinized for their author’s evaluations, American Indian 
quotations, quotations about American Indians, descriptions 
of American Indians, amount of space devoted to American 
Indians, and illustrations of American Indians. Throughout 
all the texts American Indians were described as the enemy. 
Books published in the 1970s had fewer stereotypes and 
misleading information. The characters began to live in 
diverse cultures rather than a generic culture. After the 
1890s, American Indians were not discussed in the majority 
of the texts (Clemmer 1979). 

Hoilman analyzed all genre of children and young adult 
literature for American Indian images. She found that 
nonfiction still contained misinformation and distortions, 
but the more recently published books (1970s) presented an 
American Indian point of view and showed both sides of 



O 

ERIC 



17 



8 



conflicts. Fiction, biographies, and autobiographies 
still used the four major stereotypes: noble red man, 

savage, buffoon, and helpless victim. She noted that there 
were difficulties when oral folktales of one culture were 
written for another culture. Some changes in the tales were 
needed for clarity and other changes hurt the character of 
the tales. Finally, Hoilman said modern poetry was a 
popular literary form for American Indian writers (Hoilman 



1981 ) . 

Barron looked at 114 children’s and young adult fiction 
books in the post-World War II setting. Ten categories were 
used for the analysis: setting, author’s attitudes, 

dialect, American Indian-white relations, values and ethics, 
contributions, contemporary life, character, 

characterization stereotype, and storyline stereotype. She 
found more stereotypes with regard to storyline than with 
regard to characterization. Books written by American 
Indian authors had fewer stereotypes than those written by 
non-American Indians (Barron 1981). 

Mueller also looked at themes and issues in twenty- 
three young adult realistic and historical fiction novels 
published from 1960 to 1985. As has been noted in previous 
studies, portrayal of American Indians became more diverse 
in the 1970s titles. The 1980s brought more accuracy. In 
the 1960s most of the stories were anthropological studies, 
focussing more on the culture than on plot. The themes of 
the stories in the 1970s and the 1980s dealt with main 

minority culture in 



9 

18 



characters keeping their 



a white 



dominated culture and with main characters becoming adults. 
Alcoholism was an important issue in the 1960s. In the 
1970s and the 1980s, culture loss, prejudice, and poverty 
were added to alcoholism as areas of concern. Again, a need 
for more American Indian authors was noted (Mueller 1986). 

In the single study to target only picture books, 
Edmonds looked at the treatment of whites, blacks, Asians, 
Native Americans, and Hispanics in books for young children. 
Two groups of books were used. Those published between 1928 
and 1974 were in the first group, and those published 
between 1980 and 1984 were in the second. Of the 952 books 
in the first group, only eighteen portrayed Native 
Americans. These portrayals were of noble savages 
peacefully living with nature. Few books had present day 
settings. The different tribes were identified in the 
second group of stories as contrasted to the generic Native 
American portrayed in the first group. Most of the Native 
American books in both groups were legends and folktales 
with the Native American’s peaceful relationship with nature 
as the theme (Edmonds 1986). 

Monroe looked at the representation of Native American 
females in sixty children’s picture books and chapter books 
published between 1928 and 1988. Both Native American and 
non-Native American authors and illustrators depicted 
American Indian females as Navajo or Pueblo girls between 
the ages of four and thirteen. The first modern American 
Indians appeared in books published in the 1970s. Females 
belonged to identified tribes, were active, had many skills 

10 



19 



and interests, and were usually with their families in 



rural, outdoor settings. Previous findings that Native 
American males outnumber Native American females in 
children’s literature were reconfirmed. Native American 
authors and illustrators wrote and illustrated approximately 
one-third of the books in this study (Monroe 1989). 

Burgess examined the treatment of Alaskan Natives in 
seventy contemporary Alaskan children’s fiction books 
published between 1970 and 1988. She looked at thirteen 
cultural characteristics, eight negative stereotypes and two 
positive characteristics. Most of the stories were about 
Eskimos in traditional settings. Some illustrations 
contained negative stereotypes. The more current books were 
more accurate and realistic (Burgess 1990). 

During the last twenty-five years, there has been a 
great deal of interest in how American Indians are portrayed 
in children’s literature. The middle 1970s seem to be a 
benchmark for the beginning of more realistic and accurate 
depictions. While recent studies seem to indicate that 
misrepresentations of the past are being corrected, writers 
of research and essay articles continue to recommend that 
more books by American Indian authors and illustrators be 
published. Only one study examining the treatment of 
Alaskan natives could be found (Burgess 1990). Its focus on 
contemporary children’s literature can be expanded to an 
investigation of much earlier works of Alaskan fiction for 
children. Depth can be added to the study findings by 
looking at the themes and social issues found in the 




examined books.

CHAPTER 3 

RESEARCH OBJECTIVES 

Books have the potential to build respect across 
cultures, to point out universal characteristics of all 
people, and to reinforce the self esteem of minority group 
members. Alaskan natives are changing from a subsistence 
lifestyle to a market economy lifestyle. 

This study investigates the change, over time, in the 
depiction of the Alaskan native in terms of 

characterizations, themes, and social issues in contemporary 
and historical picture books and in contemporary and 
historical fiction books written for elementary school 
children . 



Definition of Terms 

Alaskan Native 

Aleut, Athabascan, Eskimo, Haida, Tlingit, or Tsimshian 
people living in Alaska. 




Contemporary Fiction 

Books with plots, characters, and settings that are 
consistent with the lives of real people living at the time 

13 

22 



the author wrote the story (Norton 1991, 408). 
Characterization 

Description of the qualities of a person ( American 
Heritage Encyclopedic Dictionary 1987, 300). 

Contemporary Picture Book 

Books where illustrations are as important or more 
important than the text, and with plots, characters, and 
settings that are consistent with the lives of real people 
living at the time the author wrote the story (Norton 1991, 
166, 408). 

Elementary School Child 

Child between the ages of five and twelve enrolled in 
school . 

Historical Fiction 

Book where story is based on authentic settings or 
happenings (Norton 1991, 474) before Alaskan statehood in 
1959. 

Historical Picture Book 

Book where illustrations are as important or more 
important than the text and where story is based on 
authentic settings or happenings (Norton 1991, 166, 474) 
before Alaskan statehood in 1959. 

Social Issue 

Situation, which can be changed, that affects a 
significant number of people and is a source of difficulty 

14 



23 



or unhappiness (Rose 1956, 662). 



Stereotype 

Over-simplified generalization about a particular 
group, race, or sex, which usually carries derogatory 
implications (Council on Interracial Books for Children 
1980, 24). 



Theme 

The underlying idea of a story that ties plot, 
characters, and setting together into a meaningful whole 
(Norton 1991, 98). 

Basic Assumptions 

Characterizations, themes, and social issues in books 
can be broken down into discrete units. The presence or 
absence of these units in a book can be recorded. 





CHAPTER 3 



METHODOLOGY 

Content analysis was used to examine the depiction of 

Alaskan natives in fiction written for elementary students. 

Doris Cruger Dale presented a paper at a 1988 meeting of the 

Research Committee of the American Association of School 

Librarians in which she stated that 

content analysis is particularly valuable for 
investigating textbooks and children’s literature in 
order to avoid purchasing materials that are stereo- 
typical or biased in characterization or portrayal of 
events (Dale 1989, 45). 

The analysis was based on four broad categories: 

(1) physical traits which included physical features and 
types of clothing; (2) social traits which included language 
fluency, family associations, amount of formal education, 
types of occupations, and relationships with non-Alaskan 
natives; (3) cultural traits which included kinds of foods, 
types of tools and utensils, means of transportation, types 
of dwellings and predominant social concern; and (4) story 
elements which included book genre, age and sex of the main 
character, setting, and predominant theme. The coding sheet 
is found in the Appendix A.

Each time one of the descriptors on the coding 
sheet was observed in an illustration or described in the 
text of a selected book, a check was made on the appropriate 
line of the coding sheet. Data for main characters and 
secondary characters was collected separately in the follow- 
ing categories: physical features, clothing, language 

fluency, family associations, formal education, and 
occupations . 

Statistical analysis of the data included frequency 
counts and percentages. 

Limitations of the Study 

The population of this study included contemporary and 
historical picture books and contemporary and historical 
fiction books in the holdings of the Anchorage School 
District elementary school libraries, in the Juvenile 
Northern collection of the Anchorage Municipal Library and • 
in the holdings of WLN members. Searches were made on WLN’s 
LaserCAT and on the Anchorage Municipal Library’s computer 
catalog. The following subject headings were used for the 
searches: INDIANS OF NORTH AMERICA--ALASKA-- JUVENILE 

FICTION; ALEUTS--FICTION ; ATHAPASCAN INDIANS — FICTION; 
ATHAPASCAN INDIANS-- JUVENILE FICTION; ESKIMOS--FICTION ; 
ESKIMOS — JUVENILE FICTION; HAIDA INDIANS — FICTION; TLINGIT 
INDIANS--FICTION; TLINGIT INDIANS-- JUVENI LE FICTION; 

TSIMSHI AN INDIANS--FICTION ; and TSIMSHIAN-- JUVENILE FICTION. 
Since both main and secondary characters were analyzed, some 
Alaskan native secondary characters appeared in books that

ERIC 



17 



26 



were not cataloged with the above subject headings; 
therefore, a J-N and an E-N call number search of the 
Anchorage Municipal Library Juvenile Northern collection was 
also used. This Alaskan fiction collection contains older 
titles that are considered rare. 

Three hundred fifty titles were gleaned from the 
searches. These titles were divided into groups of 4, the 
fourth title being chosen for the sample. Not all of the 
sample books met the requirements of this study. Fifty-two 
books did not have Alaskan natives as either main or 
secondary characters. Thirty-nine stories were about non- 
Alaskan Eskimos. Thirty-four had Canadian Eskimo 
characters, four had Greenland Eskimo characters, and one 
had Lapps. Four books were unavailable through interlibrary 
loan. When a book was unusable for this study, another book 
in its cluster was chosen. Nine clusters of 4 books each 
were eliminated because none of the books in those clusters 
met the requirements. A sample of seventy-nine books was 
used for the study.

CHAPTER 5 
ANALYSIS OF DATA 

The analysis will examine the cumulative data for the 
sample and then will examine the information for the 
individual native groups and the individual publishing 
decades. All the percentages in the discussion and in the 
tables have been rounded to the nearest percent. The tables 
are found in Appendix B. Percentages are based on either 48 
main characters or on 79 books. The percentages in some 
tables may total more than one hundred percent because two 
books had more than one main character and because ten books 
had more than one native group represented. Three of the 
books included three native groups in each one. In most 
instances, the percentages reflect one observation of a 
descriptor for a main character or for a secondary character 
in a book or for a native group in a book. Two groups, 
Tsimshian and Prehistoric Siberian, were represented only 
once, and, one decade, 1910-1919, contained only one book. 

The sample consisted of 79 Alaska children’s fiction 
books published between 1902 and 1994. The first four 
decades included only eighteen percent of the sample (see 

19 

28 



table 1 ) . 



Story Elements 



Thirty percent of the authors and twenty-six percent of the 
illustrators of the books had lived in or had visited 
Alaska. Twenty-six books (33%) were picture books--10 
contemporary books, 6 historical books, and 10 undetermined 
picture books (see table 2). One of the books included in 
the contemporary picture book category was contemporary at 
the time that it was written but it would be considered 
historical today. It was written before Alaska statehood in 
1959. Fifty-three books (67%) were chapter fiction 
books — 31 contemporary books, 15 historical books, and 7 
undetermined books. Eleven of the books included in the 
contemporary fiction books category would be considered 
historical today. Books were classified as undetermined if 
a time period for the story could not be established through 
the text or the illustrations. 

Six Alaskan native groups were portrayed in the books. 
In addition, Mixed Heritage natives were also depicted. 

Most of the Mixed Heritage portrayals were characters who 
were part white, however, one of the Mixed Heritage 
characters was part Russian. One book told the story of 
prehistoric Siberians migrating to Alaska. As the percent- 
ages in table 3 illustrate, Eskimos were represented in more 
than half the books. Athabascans, the native group with the 
next highest representation, were in twenty percent of the 



These two groups accounted for seventy-five 



ERIC 




stories . 



percent of Alaskan native representation in the sample. 

Fifty-eight percent of the books had Alaskan natives as 
main characters. Eighty-one percent of the main characters 
were male and all but three of these males were children 
(see table 4). A character was considered to be a child if 
he or she was eighteen years old or younger. Table 5 shows 
the percentages of the main characters portrayed in each 
Alaskan native group, and table 6 separates the main 
characters in each group by gender and age. Sixty-three 
percent of the main characters were Eskimo. Male children 
main characters were dominant in five of the groups. There 
were no Aleut main characters; Tlingits had two main 
characters, one male child and one female child; and Mixed 
Heritage had one male child, one female child, and one male 
adult as main characters. When this data was categorized by 
decade, there was a change in the male domination in the 
1990s (see table 7). Forty percent of the main characters 
were female in this decade. 

Overall, sixty-one percent of the books had wilderness 
settings and thirty-one percent had village settings. Six 
of the 9 native group categories reflected these 
percentages. The Tlingit, the Tsimshian, and the 
Undetermined categories were the exceptions (see table 8). 
The Tlingit settings were equally divided between village 
and wilderness. The 1970s was the only decade in which 
village settings outnumbered wilderness settings (see table 
9 ) . 

The stories were classified into one of five themes: 

21 

30 



(1) conflict with non-Alaskan native culture, (2) descrip- 
tion of Alaskan native culture, (3) importance of 
friendship, (4) search for identity/self awareness, and 
(5) survival/adventure. If a story did not fit one of these 
categories it was classified as "other". Many of the 
"other" books were classified as animal stories. Thirty 
percent of the sample was in the "other" category. 

Together, the survival/adventure theme and the description 
of the Alaskan native culture theme included forty-nine 
percent of the books (see tables 10 and 11). At least 
forty percent of the books with Aleut, Athabascan, Eskimo, 
Haida, Tsimshian, Mixed Heritage, or Prehistoric Siberian 
characters were in one of these categories . The decade data 
revealed similar percentages through 1979. In the 1980s and 
the 1990s, the search for identity theme became more popular 
( see table 11). 

Physical Traits 

Alaskan natives were overwhelmingly represented as 
having dark hair and dark eyes (see tables 12 and 13). Dark 
hair was an especially defining trait. However, fourteen 
percent of the secondary characters were depicted with light 
hair. These were the grandparents and the shamans (elders 
who could cure illnesses and forecast weather). Hair and 
eye color were easily observed in illustrations even when 
these characteristics were not mentioned in the text. It was 
more difficult to determine height and frame type. This 
information was recorded when there were specific references 

22 

31 



to these traits in the story. 



Over fifty percent of Alaskan natives wore some type of 
fur clothing. Parkas (65%) were the most prominent and 
mukluks (63%) were a close second in clothing popularity 
(see table 14). Approximately, twenty-five percent of the 
main characters wore cloth clothes. Leather clothes were 
more likely to be worn by Athabascans (see table 15). Cedar 
bark clothes were worn by the southeastern Haidas. The two 
other southeastern groups, Tlingits and Tsimshians, wore 
cloth clothes. 



Social Traits 

Alaskan natives have distinct languages, however less 
than twenty percent of the sample indicated that the native 
characters spoke a language other than English. Secondary 
characters were more likely to speak their native tongue 
(see table 15). Approximately twenty-five percent of the 
authors avoided the language issue by writing narratives in 
which none of the characters spoke. Fifty-four percent of 
the main characters spoke fluent English. None of the main 
characters spoke broken English, but, fifty-seven percent of 
the Mixed Heritage secondary characters spoke in this 
manner. It was difficult to detect a language trend over 
time (see table 17). 

Families were an important part of Alaskan native life. 
Eighty-seven percent of the main characters lived with their 
families and sixty-one percent had good relationships with 
them (see table 18). Thirty-four percent of the secondary 

23 

32 



characters lived with their families, but as might be 
expected there was less information about their family 
relationships. 

Formal education did not seem to be an important part 
of Alaskan native life, even though ninety percent of the 
main characters were children, and fifty-two percent of the 
stories had contemporary settings. Only twenty-eight 
percent of the main characters and seventeen percent of the 
secondary characters had some type of schooling. Just one 
book had a school setting, and just one book made a 
reference to the importance of school for an Alaskan native 
character. In the majority of the stories, formal education 
was not mentioned (see table 19). Alaskan natives were more 
likely to have some education in books published in the 
1960s, 1970s, and 1980s than in the present decade (see 

table 20 ) . 

Hunting, fishing, and trapping were the occupations 
named most often (see table 21). Even though most of the 
main characters were children who were learning these 
skills, thirty percent of the main characters hunted and ten 
percent of them fished. Gathering berries and driftwood was 
the third most popular job for the main characters. Over 
sixty percent of the secondary characters who were Aleut, 
Eskimo, and Undetermined hunted (see table 22). Trappers 
were most likely to be Athabascan. One-fourth of the 
secondary characters, usually Eskimo, were clothes makers. 
These secondary characters were women who chewed the hides 
before making the garments. Shamans were a part of five of 

24 



33 



the nine groups. Modern occupations, native coporation 
employees, pilots, and teachers, were not well represented. 
Health aides, fire fighting crew members, and oil field 
workers were not mentioned. 

One-third of the Alaskan native characters had no 
contact with non-Alaskan natives (see table 23). 
Consequently, it would seem that the thirty-eight percent 
friendly relationships between Alaskan native characters and 
non-Alaska n native characters actually meant that more than 
half of Alaskan native contacts with non-Alaskan natives 
were friendly. Distrust was the most common negative 
relationship, and the distrustful relationship usually 
involved Russian fur traders. The Haidas were portrayed as 
having the least friendly relations with non-Alaskan 
natives. Unfriendly relationships were not shown until the 
1960s. In the 1980s, an equal number of friendly and 
unfriendly relationships were depicted (see table 24). 

Again, taking into account that one-third of the books 
did not have non-Alaskan natives, Alaskan natives were 
evenly portrayed as being both equal to and also inferior to 
non-Alaskan natives (see table 25). The Athabascan and 

Mixed Heritage groups were most often shown to be equal to 
non-Alaskan natives. The southeast Haida and Tlingit groups 
and the Mixed Heritage group were most often shown to be 
inferior to non-Alaskan natives. In the early decades, 

1910s through 1940s, Alaskan natives were more likely to be 
portrayed as inferior to non-Alaskan natives (see table 26). 
In the 1960s, Alaskan natives began to be portrayed more 

25 



34 



often as equal to non-Alaskan natives. A few authors in the 
early part of the century would make narrative side comments 
about the strangeness or unbelievableness of the Alaskan 
native customs in comparison to their readers* experiences. 

Three-fourths of the books did not deal with social 
concerns (see table 27). In the balance of the sample, 
prejudice, alcoholism, and loss of culture were the concerns 
most often addressed. Child abuse, divorce, drug abuse, and 
suicide were not treated. Social concerns did not emerge in 
the sample until the 1940s (see table 28). Starting in the 
1960s, social concerns began to appear more frequently, 
although, it seems that this trend began to reverse in the 
1990s. 

Cultural Traits 

Alaskan natives were predominantly pictured living in a 
traditional culture. Forty-nine percent of the characters 
traveled by dogsled and forty-six percent of the characters 
walked long distances (see table 29). Most of these 
journeys were for hunting, fishing or trading. Sixty-one 
percent of Alaskan natives used traditional water 
transportation, either a canoe, a kayak, a generic skin 
boat, or a umiak (a larger skin boat that is used for 
whaling or hauling cargo to summer camp, sometimes called a 
"women’s boat"). The most popular means of modern 
transportation was the airplane (14%) with the motor boat a 
close second (13%). Only ten percent of Alaskan natives 
used snowmobiles and none used ATVs. Both of these are very 




35 



26 



o 

ERLC 



popular in bush (rural) Alaska today. As was to be 
expected, the seacoast groups, Aleut, Haida, and Tlingit, 
mainly used water transportation (see table 30). The Haidas 
and Tlingits used wooden canoes, usually cedar. The Aleuts 
used skin boats. Athabascans and Mixed Heritage usually 
walked and Eskimos mainly traveled by dogsled. 

Alaskan natives lived in many different kinds of 
dwellings. On the whole, one type of dwelling did not seem 
to be favored over another (see table 31). The contemporary 
house, the log cabin, and the sod house seemed to be equally 
utilized. When the data was analyzed by native group, some 
trends emerged (see table 32). Athabascans and 
Mixed Heritage usually lived in log cabins. Eskimos lived 
in igloos and sod houses. Some of the sod houses were 
called igloos and some of the snow igloos were temporary 
shelters used during bad storms when the Alaska native was 
hunting. Haidas lived in cedar clan houses. Members of 
seven of the nine groups lived in contemporary houses. The 
Haidas and Prehistoric Siberians were the exceptions. 

Primarily, Alaskan natives used traditional stone and 
bone tools and utensils and ate a traditional diet 
consisting mostly of meat, both cooked and raw (see table 
34). Alaskan natives were considered to consume modern 
foods if they ate fruits and vegetables or used canned foods 
such as milk or pork and beans. Alaskan natives who had 
rifles, matches, generators, or knapsacks were considered to 
use modern tools and utensils. The Alaskan native groups 
were more likely to use modern tools and utensils than to 



36 



27 



eat modern foods.

CHAPTER 6 

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 

It is not surprising that many people mentally picture 
an Alaskan native as a dark haired, dark eyed Eskimo who 
wears a fur coat and fur boots, who lives with his family in 
the wilderness, and who travels by doglsed. This is the 
picture of the Alaskan native most consistently portrayed in 
children’s fiction books. In fact, the majority of Alaskan 
natives are Eskimo people with dark hair and dark eyes. 
However, Alaskan Eskimos wear clothes made with modern 
fabrics. Fur outer garments are worn in the winter but so 
are down coats and polar fleece. 

The majority of Alaskan natives are shown living a 
traditional subsistence lifestyle, using traditional tools 
and utensils, and eating traditional foods. Females play a 
secondary role to the males. Males hunt, fish, trek over 
long distances; females stay at home, make clothes, and cook 
food. Many Alaskan natives do subsistence hunting and 
fishing and enjoy the traditional native foods. However, 
they also live in villages, regional hubs, and the larger 
cities of Anchorage and Fairbanks. In addition to hunting 



O 

ERIC 



38 



and fishing, Alaskan natives shop at the village store, fly 
to the larger hubs and cities to shop, or order supplies by 
air freight. While many native families have dog teams, 
snowmobiles, ATVs, and riverboats are the usual means of 
transportation for bush (rural) Alaskans. 

Athabascans and Tlingits have approximately the same 
size population in the state, however twice as many 
Athabascans are portrayed in the children’s books. Native 
women are active in their communities as health aides, 
teachers and teacher aides as well as government officials 
and business owners. 

Fortunately, not all Alaskan natives were portrayed as 
Eskimos. Each of the native groups was represented in the 
sample. It is hoped that more children’s fiction books will 
be written with main characters from all the Alaskan native 
groups and more books will portray Alaskan native female and 
male children living in modern village and city settings. 

One weakness of this study is that the early decades 
are not well represented in the sample. This research could 
be improved if a cluster sample with an equal number of 
books from each decade would be chosen from the same general 
population that was used for this study. Analyzing the same 
number of books from each decade would make the comparisons 
over time of the different traits more meaningful. It would 
also be meaningful if a cluster sample could be used for 
each native group.
