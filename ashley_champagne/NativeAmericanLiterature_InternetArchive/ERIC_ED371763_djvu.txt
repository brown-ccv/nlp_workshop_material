ABSTRACT 

This bibliography lists works by authors in the 
African-American population. It is made up of fiction and non-fiction 
books drawn from standard reviewing documents and other sources 
including online sources. Its purpose is to give users an idea of the 
kinds of materials available from African-American authors. It is not 
meant to represent all titles or all formats which relate to the 
literature by authors of African American heritage writing in the 
United States. Presence of a title in the bibliography does not imply 
a recommendation by the Iowa Department of Education. The non-fiction 
materials are in the order they might appear in a library based on 
the Dewey Decimal Classification systems; the fiction follows. Each 
entry gives author if pertinent, title, publisher if known, and 
annotation. Other information includes designations for fiction or 
easy books; interest level; whether the book is in print; and 
designation of heritage of author. (JLB)

PREFACE 



A report by the Population Reference Bureau, Inc. on "America's Minorities - The Demographics 
of Diversity," predicts that half the school population in the United States will be made up of 
ethnic minorites early in the twenty-first century. Already the four largest groups - African 
Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans make up a third of the school-age 
population. It, therefore, seemed appropriate to acknowledge the efforts of authors in this 
population. 

This bibliography of fiction and nonfiction books was drawn from standard reviewing documents 
and other sources including on-line sources. It was prepared to give users an idea of the kinds of 
materials available. It is not meant to represent all titles or all formats which relate to the 
literature by authors of nonEuropean heritage writing in the United States in English or whose 
writing has been translated into English. While we have consulted our sources carefully and have 
endeavored to eliminate authors not members of the designated ethnic group, and members of the 
designated group who are from Canada, Mexico, Central and South America or from Africa or Asia, 
we acknowledge the probability of errors in this bibliography and beg the user's pardon in such 
cases. We have also included collections of literature and folklore even if collected by persons not 
members of the designated group when the literature itself was all or partly by ethnic authors 
and if that folklore was developed in what is now the United States or has received major 
modification in that area. Presence of a title in the bibliography does not imply 
advocacy by the Department of Education. 

The bibliography is divided into sections by the four major ethnic groups, African American, 
Asian American, Hispanic American and Native American. Each secHion is in classed order, that 
is, in the order materials might appear on the shelves of a library. Numbers assigned are from 
the Dewey Decimal system and are approximations of call numbers which might be assigned in a 
library or library media center. Fiction books are labeled with an "P and Easy books for lower 
elementary and preschool are labeled with an "E\ Entries give author where pertinent, title, 
publisher if known, and annotation. Most materials included were in print at the time the 
bibliography was prepared. Those known to be out of print are marked o.p. Publisher's address 
is given when known for companies not included in BOOKS IN PRINT, IL introduces the Interest 
Level when known or estimated. Abbreviations for ethnic groups will be explained in the 
appropriate section. 



AFRICAN AMERICAN LITERATURE 



Section Introduction 



The African ancestors of African Americans came from many different parts of a large 
continent. Unfortunately, little information is available to us about the section or people 
of origination of African American authors and no attempt has been made within this 
bibliography to identify either. African American was the term chosen to indicate ethnic 
heritage. "AF" for African American is used at the end of an entry with authorship too 
multiple to indicate and for folklore. The principal sources used in the development of 
this section are AFRICAN AMERICAN LITERATURE {Holt, Rinehart, Winston/Harcourt, 
Brace Jovanovich, 1992; BLACK VOICES and NEW BLACK VOICES (Mentor, 1968, 
1972); BLACK WRITERS OF AMERICA (Macmillan, 1972); Barbara Rollock's BLACK 
AUTHORS AND ILLUSTRATORS OF CHILDREN'S BOOKS (Garland, 1992); and Helen 
Williams' BOOKS BY AFRICAN-AMERICAN AUTHORS AND ILLUSTRATORS FOR CHILDREN 
AND YOUNG ADULTS (American Library Association, 1991).
