This bibliography acknowledges the efforts of authors

of Cuban, Mexican, and Puerto Rican descent who are or were U.S. 
citizens or long-term residents. It is made up of fiction and 
non-fiction books drawn from standard reviewing documents and other 
sources including online sources. Its purpose is to give users an 
idea of the kinds of materials available from Hispanic American 
authors. It. is not meant to represent all titles or all formats which 
relate to the literature by authors of Hispanic American heritage 
writing in the United States. Presence of a title in the bibliography 
does not imply a recommendation by the Iowa Department of Education. 
The non-fiction materials are in the order they might appear in a 
library based on the Dewey Decimal Classification systems; the 
fiction follows. Each entry gives author if pertinent, title, 
publisher if known, and annotation. Other information includes 
designations for fiction or easy books; interest level; whether the 
book is in print; and designation of heritage of author. (JLB)

PREFACE 



A report by the Population Reference Bureau, Inc. on "America's Minorities - The Demographics 
of Diversity," predicts that half the school population in the United States will be made up of 
ethnic minorites early in the twenty-first century. Already the four largest groups - African 
Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans make up a third of the school-age 
population. It, therefore, seemed appropriate to acknowledge the efforts of authors in this 
population. 

This bibliography of fiction and nonfiction books was drawn from standard reviewing documents 
and other sources including on-line sources. It was prepared to give users an idea of the kinds of 
materials available. It is not meant to represent all titles or all formats which relate to the 
literature by authors of nonEuropean heritage writing in the United States in English or whose 
writing has been translated into English. While we have consulted our sources carefully and have 
endeavored to eliminate authors not members of the designated ethnic group, and members of the 
designated group who are from Canada, Mexico, Central and South America or from Africa or Asia, 
we acknowledge the probability of errors in this bibliography and beg the user's pardon in such 
cases. We have also included collections of literature and folklore even if collected by persons not 
members of the designated group when the literature itself was all or partly by ethnic authors 
and if that folklore was developed in what is now the United States or has received major 
modification in that area. Presence of a title in the bibliography does not imply 
advocacy by the Department of Education. 

The bibliography is divided into sections by the four major ethnic groups, African American, 
Asian American, Hispanic American and Native American. Each section is in classed order, that 
is, in the order materials might appear on the shelves of a library. Numbers assigned are from 
the Dewey Decimal system and are approximations of call numbers which might be assigned in a 
library or library media center. Fiction books are labeled with an "F" and Easy books for lower 
elementary and preschool are labeled with an "E". Entries give author where pertinent, title, 
publisher if known, and annotation. Most materials included were in print at the time the 
bibliography was prepared. Those known to be out of print are marked o.p. Publisher's address 
is given when known for companies not included in BOOKS IN PRINT. IL introduces the Interest 
Level when known or estimated. Abbreviations for ethnic groups will be explained in the 
appropriate section. 



HISPANIC AMERICAN LITERATURE 

Section Introduction 

Among the sources used in the development of this segment of the bibliography are 
UNDERSTANDING CHICANO UTERATURE, by Carl R. Shirley and Paula W. Shirley

by Charles Tatum (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1990) and NORTH OF THE RIO GRANDE: 
THE MEXICAN-AMERICAN EXPERIENCE IN SHORT STORY (Mentor, 1992). To the extent 
known, authors are identified as Cuban American, Mexican American, and Puerto Rican 
American. Chteano is considered a synonym of Mexican American which is the term used 
in this document for ethnic designation. Hispanic American is used when exact 
information is unavailable or when the author is other than the above. The 
abbreviations used include HA, PR, MA.
