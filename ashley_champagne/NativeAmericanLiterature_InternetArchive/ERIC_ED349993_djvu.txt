Children's Books from the U.S. Government Printing Office: 
Annotated Bibliography and Resource Guide for Librarians. 

Introduction. 

Books illustrating the natural beauties of our national parks, 
the dangers of environmental pollution, the prevention of disease, the 
glory of space flight, the evils of discrimination, and the importance 
of a healthy diet are just a few of the subjects found in the myriad 
of books, pamphlets, and brochures that are printed each year by the 
U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO) . 

Though educators, librarians, and other information specialists 
may come in contact with government documents, few realize that many 
of these materials are aimed at children. Indeed, government- 
sponsored books for children are an important, though under-utilized 
resource. And as a window into our past and our present, the 
children^ books document the social, cultural, and political concerns 
of the times. 

Over the years, one of the agencies of government, the Library of 
Congress (LC) , has been a leader in compiling book lists and 
recommending books for young readers, and to its credit are several 
series devoted to doing just that: among them, Discoveries ,, Books for 
Children , For Young Readers , and Braille Book Review . 

Although LC publications deal with children's literature, the 
intended audience generally has not been the child, but rather, the 
teacher, parent, librarian, or school administrator with an interest 
in acquiring books and magazines for children. Perhaps less known is 
the fact that government agencies other than LC also have, from time

to time, designed, published, and sold to the public books targeted to 
children of all ages. 

A review of children's books distributed by the Government 
Printing Office between 1944 and 1990 reveals a wide range of 
subjects, from preventing drug abuse to promoting personal hygiene. 
For example, the Environmental Protection Agency designs coloring 
books to stimulate an interest in ecology, the National Institute of 
Education publishes story-books that are culturally sensitive to 
native American Indian children, and the National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration prints booklets on traffic safety. 

Not all government books have such lofty themes. One charming 
booklet issued by the Postal Service, entitled, A coloring book story 
about Mary and Johnny's letter to their grandparents f includes space 
for children to design a postage stamp and many pages of illustrations 
for coloring. 

This bibliography contains a sample of government-sponsored books 
for children, including coloring books, picture-story books, activity 
books, comic books, and readers. The books are arranged by agency; 
brief annotations describe content and format, and intended age groups 
are provided whenever this information appeared in the publication. 
In addition, Superintendent of Documents call numbers appear in 
brackets [] at the end of each citation to facilitate inter-library 
loans and inquiries from the Government Printing Office or from the 
national network of GPO book stores. For additional information on 
how to obtain copies of publications listed in the annotated 
bibliography, please refer to the attached resource guide.
