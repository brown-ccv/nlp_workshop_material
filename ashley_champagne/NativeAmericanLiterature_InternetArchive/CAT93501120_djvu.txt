The cover design is a pen-and-ink drawing of Indian utensils and arms drawn by Karl Bodmer during 
the years 1832-1834. Prince Maximilian of Wied-Neuweid, a prince-city that has become part of 
Germany, visited North America during that period; and, to illustrate Maximilian's written account of 
the trip, a young Swiss artist, Karl Bodmer, accompanied him to provide an accurate visual record of 
the expedition. Karl Bodmer's drawings now provide documentary evidence of America's wilderness 
frontier for historians, anthropologists, and naturalists.

INTRODUCTION 



Populations 

The U.S. Census Bureau counts as Native American anyone who so declares himself or herself as 
such. No single Federal or tribal criteria establishes a person's identity as a Native American. 

There are 510 federally-recognized tribes in the United States, including about 200 village groups in 
Alaska.' The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that nearly 2 million Native Americans lived in the 
United States in 1990.^ This included 1,878,285 American Indians, 57,152 Eskimos, and 23,797 
Aleuts.' 

According to the 1990 statistics from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, U.S. Department of the Interior, 
almost 950,000 individuals of this total population lived on or adjacent to the 278 Federal Indian 
reservations, pueblos, rancherias, and communities. These reservations range from over 16 million 
acres to 100 acres, and the local governing authority on each reservation is the tribal government. A 
total of 56.2 million acres of land are held in trust by the United States Government for various 
Indian tribes and individuals. Much of this land is reservation land; however, not all reservation land 
is trust land. 

Federal Sources of Support 

Membership in a particular tribe requires meeting its membership rules, and the amount of blood 
quantum needed varies—some tribes require a person to have only a trace of Indian blood of that tribe 
while others require as much as one-half. 

These requirements may affect the services received by tribal members. For instance, the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs primarily administers programs for members of federally-recognized tribes who live on 
or near reservations. Eligibility for the Bureau's services requires that individuals be members of a 
tribe recognized by the Federal Government and that they be at least one-fourth Native American 
ancestry. 

The primary Federal health resource for Native Americans is the Indian Health Service (IHS), Public 
Health Service, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. IHS operates hospitals and clinics 
on reservations and provides health-related services for Native American communities. 

Languages 

Today, some 250 tribal languages are still spoken: some by only a few individuals and others by 
many. Most Native Americans now use English as their first language to communicate with nontribal 
members. For many, however, it is a second language. 



^The term "federally-recognized" means these tribes and groups 
have a special, legal relationship with the U.S. Government and its 
agent, the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

The National Agricultural Library (NAL) accepts requests from libraries and other organizations in 
accordance with the national and international interlibrary loan code and guidelines. In Its national role, 
NAL supplies copies of agricultural materials not found elsewhere. Filling requests for materials readily 
available from other sources diverts NAL's resources and diminishes its ability to serve as a national 
source for agricultural and agriculturally related materials. Therefore, NAL is viewed as a library of last 
resort. 

Submit requests to state/region/network sources prior to sending to NAL Within the United States, 
possible sources are public libraries, land-grant university libraries or other large research libraries within a 
state. In other countries submit requests to major university, national or provincial institutions. If the 
needed publications are not available from these sources, submit requests to NAL with a statement 
indicating their non-availability.

from an NAL database (CAIN/AGRICOLA, Bibliography of Agriculture, or the NAL catalog). 

Loan Service — Materials in the NAL collection are loaned only to U.S. libraries. The loan period is one 
month. Loans may be renewed for an additional month if there is no reserve. Make renewal requests in 
writing or by calling prior to the due date. The borrowing library is responsible for any loss or damage to

This archive has original film and video materials of Native 
Americans, including historical footage from the early 20th 
century as well as more recent ethnographic footage. 



The archive contains the largest set of manuscripts and 
photographs in existence documenting North American Indian 
cultures, from 1860 through 1985. 



The museum's American Indian Program was established in 
1984 to offer technical assistance and cooperative support to 
American Indian tribes, communities, and other educational 
and cultural institutions; to produce exhibitions, publications, 
and educational and scholarly materials; to sponsor research 
and training; and to develop collections, public programs, and 
collaborative initiatives with Native Americans. 

The Department of Anthropology is a repository of almost 2 
million American Indian objects from North and South 
America. It also offers two programs, the American Indian 
Program and the Arctic Program, to emphasize education, 
research, and exhibitions on those cultures. 



Scheduled to open in 1998, this museum will be dedicated to 
the collection, preservation, study and exhibition of American 
Indian languages, literature, history, art, and culture from 
throughout the Americas. Its foundation will be the collection 
of artifacts formerly in the Museum of the American Indian, 
Heye Foundation, in New York City. 

This office has a strong commitment to the interpretation and 
conservation of Native American cultures. It organizes the 
Festival of American Folklife every year and offers a variety 
of resources, including archival materials such as recorded 
performances from past folklife festivals, films, and 
monographs on such topics as Ojibwa drum construction and
