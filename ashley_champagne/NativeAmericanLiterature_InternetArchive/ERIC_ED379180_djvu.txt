ABSTRACT 

This theme issue explores the changes in Iowa's 
environment. When Native Americans lived in Ioya hundreds ~€ years 
ago, the land was rich in tall grasslands, fertile soil, wildlife, 
wetlands, and unpolluted waters. When European-American pioneers 
settled Iowa in 1833, they changed the environment in order to 
survive. The first article in this issue discusses recycling. Another 
article describes the wildlife that used to be plentiful in Jowa, the 
loss of so^ie species, and the reintroduct ion of others. Articles are 
devoted to pesticides, heirloom seeds, and bird watchers. More 
extensive articles describe Iowa wetlands, Iowa's flood history, 
erosion, and recycling. A learning activity on making compost is 
included along with a quiz on compost materials. Iowa f s prairie 
history is explored in another article. Sections discuss breaking the 
prairie, prairie fires, and prairies today. Other learning activities 
include a word find, a word scramble, and cartoon, all dealing with 
the environment. A short story about recycling is included. The last 
article describes the activities of different youngsters in 
celebrating Earth Day. A list of four books is offered as additional 
reading. Four pamphlets available from government agencies or private 
organizations are included. (DK)

When Native Americans lived in Iowa hundreds of years 
ago, the land was rich in tall grasslands, fertile soil, wildlife, 
wetlands, and unpolluted waters. . 

When European-American pioneers settled Iowa in 1833, 
they changed the environment in order to survive. Settlers cut 
down trees to build houses and barns. They farmed Iowa's 
prairies to grow crops to feed their families and livestock, and 
they drained the wetlands and turned soggy soil into rich farm- 

land ' Today, all decisions concerning the natural environment 
can be good or bad for Iowa's land and the humans and animals 

who live here. . 

This issue of The Goldfinch explores the changes in 
Iowa's environment. To learn more about Iowa's environmental 
history, visit the "Delicate Balance" exhibit at the State Historical

Ready, Set, Recycle! 



IOWA — What would you do with 
an empty drink bottle? Toss it in 
the garbage? Maybe slam-dunk it 
into a recycling bin, or trade it in 
for a nickel? 

If you lived in Iowa ISO years 
ago, when glass was very 
expensive, you would wash the 
bottle carefully, and reuse it until u 
broke beyond repair. 

In later years, when tin and 
aluminum containers replaced glass, 
you probably would have thrown 
your pop containers in the garbage. 

All this changed in 1979 when 
Iowa became the fourth state to pass 
a "bottle bill " requiring a five-cent 
deposit on many glass, plastic, and 
aluminum beverage containers. Like 
they do today, Iowans received five 
cents for every empty soft drink 
container returned for recycling. 

When the bill was just a year old, 
Iowans had reduced and bottle 
litter along roads and highways by 
79 percent, Jeff Fiagle of the Iowa 
Department of Natural Resources 
(IDNR) told The Goldfinch. 

4 The Goldfinch 



Now the bill encourages Iowans 
to recycle. A law passed in 1990 
outlawed disposal of five-cent-return 
beverage containers in landfills. 

Because Iowans are so "into" 
recycling, an estimated 66,955 tons 
of plastic, glass, aluminum, and 
steel soft-drink containers were 
recycled in 1991. Not bad for a state 
that consumes an estimated 792 
soft drinks a year. (That's a little 
more than 285 containers a year per 
person!) Some Iowa legislators 
want to expand the bottJ e bill to 
include fruit juice containers. Ten 
other states have bottle bills similar 
to Iowa's. 

Paper and some plastics also can 
be recycled. Tney are made from 
materials that can be broken down 
and used again and again. Often, less 
energy is required to make products 
out of already recycled materials. 

Today in Iowa, recycled 
newspaper is reused for animal 
bedding, and crushed glass is used 
for building roads. 

— Amy Ruth 



Iowa's first Native American 
residents made very little garbage. 
They put ashes, animal bones, and 
broken pottery in empty, under- 
ground food-storage pits. They used 
much of their "waste" in sacred 
ceremonies, said Marlin Ingalls of the 
Office of the State Archaeologist 

Early pioneers also didn't make 
much trash. They dumped or burned 
food scraps, wooden items, clothing, 
and glass in open fields. 

"If you look back 175 years ago, 
people raised their own food," Lavoy 
Haage of the Iowa Department of 
Natural Resources (IDNR) told The 
Goldfinch. 'They didn't throw away 
nearly as much" 



Iowa Wildlife: 

KEOKUK COUNTY — When E.D. 
Nauman (NEW-muhn) was learning 
to count, his mother called him to 
the east window of their home in 
Keokuk County to count the wild 
turkeys pecking in the orchard. That 
day in the late 1860s, Nauman 
counted 22 birds. 

Young Nauman also may have 
seen prairie chickens playing in the 
tall grasslands, white-tailed deer and 
American Elk roaming woodland 
meadows, grouse feeding in the 
forest, and bam owls nesting in 
hollow trees. If he was lucky, he 
might have seen a few buffalo.

Iowa's TXaShy Habit 




A manufacturing boom in the 
1860s spurred the production of 
throw-away items such as tin and 
cheap glass, and the expanding 
railroad brought these items west 

Many farmers dumped their wara 
on their property, sometimes 
polluting streams. 

Incinerators were built to bun 
garbage but were expensive to 
operate. Des Moines was the third 
city in the country to build an 
incinerator in 1887, after New Yax 
City and Pittsburgh. 

Urban waste went to open dunps 
outside city limits where it was snne 
times covered with soil or burned 



Dumps were used to control 
waste in Iowa's cities until about 
twenty-five years ago, Bill Johnson, 
curator ct natural history at the State 
Historical Society of Iowa, told The 
Goldfinch. The dumps smelled of 
rotting food and wet, molding 
garbage. It wasn't unusual to see 
rats, possums, raccoons, and farm 
hogs rummaging through the trash 
for their next meal, Johnson said. 

Many of the hogs passed harmful 
diseases to humans when the 
animals were slaughtered and eaten. 
It wasn't until 1955 that legislators 
made it illegal for farmers to feed 
their hogs at city dumps. 



Modern landfills were developed 
in the 1960s and have layers of 
plastic and clay between the garbage 
and the ground. These layers block 
the poisons in the garbage from 
sinking into the soil and polluting 
the water under ground. But landfills 
are not 100 percent safe. Unnoticed 
leaks in the plastic liners allow 
poisons to seep into the ground. 

Iowa's first modem landfill 
opened in Des Moines in 1972. All 
open dumps were closed and covered 
with soil by 1975. Today, there are 
seventy-five landfills in Iowa.

Lost and Found 



These animals lived on Iowa's 
prairies, meadows, and woodlands 
long before European pioneers 
settled in Iowa in the 1800s. 

As pioneers from the East startec 
new lives in Iowa by plowing 
prairies, hunting animals, and cuttinr 
down trees to build houses and barn:, 
the natural environment changed. 
Owls lost their wooded nesting area!, 
and the farmed prairies no longer 
provided food or nesting si'es for 
prairie chickens — once the largest 
population of game birds in the start 
1 Wild turkeys and grouse couldn't fim 
food in the cleared woodlands. The 



area wf*re 



American elk moved west in search 
of grass, leaves, and twigs. 

Although Iowa has lost some of 
its species, conservation efforts 
have reintroduced some of Iowa's 
native animals to the natural 
environment. 

Since 1987, Iowa Department of 
Natural Resources (IDNR) workers 
have brought more than 450 prairie 
chickens to Iowa from Kansas. 

These birds have settled in private 
grasslands in Adair and Ringgold 
counties. Grouse have resettled in 
wooded areas in south-central Iowa. 

After wild turkeys disappeared 



from Iowa in the early 1900s, no 
other animal took over its habitat 
and food supply, said Tim 
Thompson, wildlife biologist with 
the IDNR. Because of this, the 
IDNR successfully restocked Iowa 
with wild turkeys in the mid-1960s. 

Today, there arc many wild 
turkeys in Iowa — so many that 
some farmers claim the birds dig up 
seeds in their fields, much like they 
did in E.D. Nauman's orchard more 
than 100 years ago

PESTICIDES 

friend or foe? 



IOWA CITY — Alrazine. Alachlor. 
Metolachlor. Simazine. These might 
sound like scary space monsters, but 
they are really names of pesticides 
farmers use on their crops. 
Pesticides are chemicals that are 
sprayed on farm fields in Iowa to 
destroy weeds or insects that harm 
crops. 

Farmers haven't always used 
pesticides to grow crops. Before 
pesticides were invented, farmers 
plowed their fields to destroy weeds. 
Old stalks and plants also kept the 
weeds from growing. Little could be 
done, however, to stop hungry in - 
sects looking for tasty corn or beans. 

In the 1940s, when pesticides were 
invented, farmers could grow more 
crops, and fewer unwanted weeds. 
Pesticides caused corn-and bean - 
eating insects to move away, too. 

Some of the earliest pesticides 
were harmful. Instead of destroy- 
ing only pesky insects, animals, 
or plants, they harmed other 
living species they touched. Birds, 
fish, and tiny animals living in the 
soil moved from sprayed areas or 
were killed. Pesticides were even 
found in drinking water. 

The government began to study the 
pesticides that stayed in the envi- 
ronment and couldn't be broken down 
by water or air. These pesticides were 



banned and laws were passed to keep 
Iowa's drinking water and food free 
from dangerous chemicals. 

State Pesticide Bureau Chief 
Chuck Eckermann told The 
GoUfinch about laws that require 
farmers to go to school to learn 
about pesticides. Farmers also must 
document the kinds and amounts of 
pesticides they use. Pesticides are 
always being studied to see if they 
are safe or harmful to the 
environment, said Eckermann. 

A small number of Iowa farmers 
don't use pesticides at all. These 
farmers are often called organic 
farmers. Instead of using human- 
made pesticides, they let nature 
control weeds and pests. 

Eight-year-old David Braverman 
of Iowa City helps his dad, Bob, an 
organic farmer, hoe and plant their 
14-acre farm in the summer. The 
Bravermans rely on insects, like lady 
bugs, to control pests. They use hay 
and straw to control weeds. 
Decomposed kitchen garbage, like 
eggs shells, is used as fertilizer. 

Many Iowa farmers are now 
using smaller amounts of chemicals 
on their crops, Eckermann said. 
Some still plow their fields to 
control weeds, just like their 
ancestors in the 1930s might have 
done. — Sherri Dagel 




DECORAH — When twelve-year-old k 
Bathsheba (Bath-SHEE-buh) Rose 
Demuth of Decorah reaches into her 
bucket for a mangel to feed her ten 
rabbits, slie's also reaching deep into 
Iowa's histofy. 

She started growing mangels a 
year ago, planting in May and 
harvesting in September. She stores 
hex crop in a root cellar where they 
keep throughout the winter. 

"It's kind of like keeping part of a 
tradition alive that people have

Mangels are inexpensive to grow 
and store, and were commonly 
grown in Iowa in the 1800s to feed 
livestock. At the turn of the century, 
many farmers began using corn as 
feed, and stopped growing mangels. 

In the 1800s, Iowa farmers also 
grew many other crcps — corn, 
wheat, sorghum (SOR-gum), and 
apples — to ' sed their families and 
livestock. 

Sorghum was used as a sugar 
substitute. The juice from this grass 
plant was made into a thick, syrupy 
sugar, similar to molasses. 

With advances in technology, 
factory-made goods replaced many 
home-made gocds, and products like 
refined sjgar and feed com became 
readily available. 

After WW n, farmers began to 
buy seeds from seed companies, 
instead of saving their own seeds 
from year to year and replanting 
them. This led to the loss of many 
old varieties of seeds, including 
those once grown in Iowa. 

So Iowa's seeds aren't lost 
forever, Seed Saver's Exchange 
(SSE) in Decorah collects heir- 
loom seeds. Members throughout 
the country exchange more than 
16,000 varieties, keeping them alive 
by growing them in their gardens. 

Bathsheba Rose's father, Steve 
Demuth, who works for SSE, says 
growing heirloom seeds is good way 
to preserve Iowa's agricultural 
heritage. He has passed this tradition 
on to his daughter, who is doing her 
share to save Iowa's seeds.

observation tower 
In 1915. Today, the

NATIONAL — Althea Sherman loved } 
birds. As a young girl, she watched 
barn swallows dive and swoop over 
her parents' farm in Clayton County. One summer, she and other children 
collected more than 200 prairie chicken eggs. The kids hoped the eggs would 
hatch into 200 prairie chicken pets. The eggs hatciied after a few weeks, but 
all of the chicks ran away. Despite this early disappointment, Althea 
continued watching birds throughout her life. 

Born on a farm in northeastern Iowa in October 1853, Althea was the 
fourth of six children. Her parents, Mark and Melissa Sherman, were pio- 
neers who turned Iowa's natural prairies into farmland. The family's success- 
ful farm provided enough money for the Shermans to educate their children. 

Althea attended high school in nearby Fayette. After graduating, she 
traveled with her two sisters to Ohio's Obcrlin College where she studied art. 
After college she became an art teacher. 

In 1895, she moved to her parents* home in National, Iowa, to care for her 
aging father. In her free time, Althea watched the same kinds of birds she had 
loved as a child. She began to draw and study them. 

Althea also kept journals. In her notebooks she recorded the kinds, 
numbers, and actions of birds she saw each day. She used her art skills to 
draw pictures of birds and their babies. 

Althea wrote more than seventy magazine articles about birds. She became 
. widely known after many of her bird studies were printed in science 
magazines. She worked hard to develop better bird-watching methods. 

In 1915, Althea had a 28-foot-tall tower built in her backyard in National, 
Iowa so she could study birds without frightening them. People came from 
miles around, over muddy and dusty dirt roads, to sec Althea and her tower. 

Althea was sad to learn the numbers and kinds of birds in Iowa had 
decreased since she had returned to Iowa. Birds were forced to leave when 
their habitats were destroyed by settlers' fields and houses. 

Before she died in 1943, Althea bought many of the houses in her town so 
the birds had a permanent place to live. Although the plan was never carried 
out, Althea wanted to build a bird sanctuary in National so birds of Iowa 
could be watched and enjoyed forever. — Sherri Dagel

Three Iowa Kids 

Wonder about Wetlands 



Fhenthe last glacier 
melted off Iowa thou- 
sands of years ago, 
largeand small openings in the 
land filled with water. These 
areas, known as "prairie pot- 
holes" and wetlands, are a 
combination of soggy soil and 
standing water. Mosquitoes, 
frogs, beavers, muskrats, and 
many types of birds make their 
homes in these wet environ- 
ments. 

European-Americans enter- 
ing Iowa in the 1830s found 



that at least one-fifth of the 
state was wetlands. Tneir 
wagon wheels got stuck in the 
marshy ground and much of 
the soil was too wet to plant In 
the 1880s, formers took the 
moisture out of the land by 
draining it They dug long, 
narrow ditches that allowed the 
water to run off into waterways. 
They buried clay pipes, called 
tiles, under the ground to carry 
away even more water. 

Today, fewer than 30,000 
wetland acres remain. Many 



organizations and individuals 
are trying to protect Iowa's 
remaining wetlands. Three 
Amana fifth-graders discovered 
farm fields h their community 
that will be returned to their 
natural marshy state. Annie 
Trumpold, Kathryn Croco, 
Andy Grimm, all eleven, talked 
with Mike Shoup of Amana 
Society farms about fields the 
Amana Society will restore and 
keep as a wetland. 

"The wetlands we're planning 
will cover 136 acres," Shoup 



Andy Grimm, 
Kathryn Croco, 
Annie Trumpold, 
and their teacher, 
Marty Reihman, 
inspect an Iowa 
County map with 
Mike Shoup in the 
Amana Society 
Farms and For- 
estry Office. They 
learned how fields 
can be restored to 
a natural wetland 
state. 




8 The Goldfinch 



said. The two large fields that 
will become wetlands were 
marshy pastures when Shoup 
attended school in Amana in 
the 1960s. "It was planted with 
beans and corn rometime after 
that/ he said, and crops have 
been there ever since. 

The Amana Elementary 
School students were happy to 
learn that wetlands help reduce 
flooding. Much of their com- 
munities were effected by the 
flood of 1993. Andy said he 
remembers a foot of water in 
his family's basement When a 
levee in Main Amana broke last 
summer, he filled sandbags to 
protect Amana businesses. 

The Gol^inch listened in as 
Shoup, Andy, Annie, and 
Kathryn talked about restoring 
wetlands. 

Why do you want to put in a 
wetland? 

Water quality is one of the 
primary reasons. Wetlands give 
water a place to stay before it 
filters down into the ground 
water. Soil and vegetation are 
very good filters. 

Wetlands provide habitat for 
wildlife, giving them a place to 
nest, hunt or pass through 
during migration. 

Flood prevention is another 
reason for restoring wetlands. 
The wetlands store water. By 
increasing the area for storing 



the water, we actually decrease 
flooding. Wetlands are also a 
good area for people to go and 
enjoy and learn about nature. 

How will you build the 
wetland? 

We're going to put dikes 
around the entire area. Any 
tiling that was done for drain- 
ing the land will be removed. 
Control structures will allow us 
to lower or raise the water 
level. 

Since wetlands existed 
naturally in Iowa before 
land was farmed, why do 
they now have to be man- 
aged by people to survive? 

Today people are every- 
where. We're influencing 
everything. We've put bound- 
aries around things and 
changed things to a certain 
point where they have to be 
brought back closer to a 
balance again. People have also 
introduced a lot of different 
plants and animals that have an 
impact on what used to be 
"natural," 

How was the land originally 
changed from wetlands to 
crop land? 

What has happened 
throughout Iowa and through- 
out the United States is that 
farmers have wanted to farm 



more ground. As they've 
drained and farmed the wet- 
land areas, problems such as 
flooding have gotten worse. 
We've also lost a number of 
animal species. Migration 
patterns for birds have 
changed. Many animals lose 
their habitats when wetlands 
are drained. People are realiz- 
ing that we need wedands to 
maintain a balance. 



Iowa* s first European-American 
settlers used underground clay 
tiles to drain wetlands. 




The Goldfinch 9 

JO 



How long will it take to 
make the wetland, and what 
v^M it look like? 

Probably two to three years. 
The area will be sixty to eighty 
percent covered with shallow 
water. There will be cattail and 
bulrushes growing up through 
the water. Youll probably be 
able to see a number of musk- 
rat nests in the water that look 
like little mounds. Around the 
edges there will be native 
prairie grasses. As the year 
progresses, there will be a lot 
of birds out there. 

Will we see new kinds of 
birds? 

There will be a wide variety 
of birds. Some will hunt and 
nest here. Others, such as 
white pelicans, will come 
through during migration. 

10 The Goldfinch 



Will converting fields to 
wetlands lead to a shortage 
of crops? 

I see people and their 
technology remaining ahead of 
any reduction in crop acres. 
The improved varieties of seeds 
that farmers plant will make up 
for any difference in the num- 
ber of acres planted. 



As the wetland develops, 
there are many ways Andy, 
Annie, and Kathryn can help. 
First, they will go back to their 
classmates and share what 
they've learned about wetlands 
— stories of birds and plants, 
water and mud, and how it all 
comes together as a balanced 
ecosystem. 

Then they can all get in- 

n 



volved. Kids can help keep the 
wetland area clean and partici- 
pate in nature studies as the 
wetland takes shape. 

— Millie K. Frese 



What You Can Do 

May is American Wetlands 
Month — a good time to study 
wetlands in your community. 
Observe plant and animal life in 
a pond or swamp. Compare 
wetland soil and water samples 
to samples you take from your 
backyard or a riverbank. How 
are the samples different? How 
are they the same?

The summer heat and flies were attracted to 
the flooded, swamp-like river, and to Andy,

It was summer, 1947, and Andy and his 
uncle were caught in the rages of a state-wide 
flood. Andy had broken his arm earlier in 
the day while playing in his Grandmother's 
yard in Douds, Iowa. The closest doctor was 
n Ottumwa — about 18 miles away. Andy 
and his uncle traveled by rowboat, waded 
through flood waters and finally drove miles 
out of their way on winding back roads to 
reach Dr. Cooper's office. 



IOWAS 
FLOOD 

HISTORY 



"I was such a tiny thing and so afraid," 
Reddick, now 53, told The Goldfinch. "I *as 
so scared and wanted my momma," 

Throughout Iowa's history, floods have 
ravaged the state, taking many lives and 
causing billions of dollars worth of damage 
to homes, businesses, roads, and crops. 

Flood Facts 

Floods occur for several reasons. Heavy, 
constant rains soak into the soil, fill rivers, 
and overflow waterways. Large quantities 
of snow during the winter melt easily with 
higher spring temperatures and cause rapid 
flooding. This is what happened in 1880 
when the state received record amounts of 
snow that quickly melted with warm 
April temperatures. 




Heavy flooding often turns city streets into canals, 
like this Dubuque street in 1916. For years, Iowa 
flood victims have relied on rowboats and canoes 
to travel through flood waters. 



Cultivation also causes floods, because it 
speeds up the now of water across the land. 
Plowing and planting loosens the soil, and 
rain washes the soil downhill. This soil 
collects instreambeds. 

Flooding also can be good for the envir- 
onment Flood waters have carried fertile 
sediment to Iowa's riverbottoms for thou- 
sands of years, making it some of the state's 
richest soil. 

But flooding also damages the 
environment. Flood waters can cover the 
soil with sand deposits, making it hard to 
grow crops. Trees are pushed over or split 
from the force of flood waters. 

Flood waters can kill water plants that 
ducks and other water animals depend on 
for food and shelter. Fish living in shallow, 
clear water can't survive in deep, murky 
flood waters. 

Floods effect business and industry, too. 

Located on the Mississippi River in northeastern 
Iowa, the town of McGregor floods almost every 
year. In 1909, flooding left garbage, dirt, and lots 
of water on this downtown street 




SHSI 



Wet and soggy soil prevents farmers from 
planting crops. Construction workers can't 
begin to dig basements of new buildings 
until the soil is iry. 

First Flood 

Iowa's first major recorded flood struck 
the state in 1851, devastating the property of 
Iowans who had settled low areas by rivers 
and creeks to be close to fresh water supplies 
and timber. Spring rains in 1850 had been 
heavy, and by spring 1851, the soil was so 
moist, it couldn't hold much more 
precipitation . Heavy May rains quickly 
overflowed waterways in two-thirds of the 
state, flooding roads, homes, businesses, and 
farms, fhe streets in Keosauqua, Bonaparte, 
and Farmington in the southeastern part of 
the state turned into canals. Many families 
evacuated their homes and found relief from 
the rising waters on higher ground. As the 
rain continued to pour through their towns 
in June and July, food supplies ran short 
Flood waters swept away supplies of corn 
stored in silos and destroyed the fields that 
held crops for the coming year. 

Like they did in the flood of 1993, Iowans 
caught in the flood of 1851 filled sandbags 
and built levees to protect their towns. 

Controlling Floods 

Although floods can't be controlled 
completely, precautions can prevent some 
flood damage, iowans have built bridges 
high enough to handle rising waters, and 
strong enough to bear the force of raging 
waters. Many people have built their homes 
away from rl ers. For Iowans with homes 
and businesses near rivers, building levees 
can sometimes keep flood waters out

Dams and reservoirs control water 
levels. These structures store and hold back 
river water, which is released slowly 
through gates, depending on how much 
water the riverchannel can hold. Iowa's 
four reservoirs — Coralville, Rathbun, Red 
Rock, and Saylorville — were built between 
1938 and 1977. 

More Flooding 

Iowa has experienced many major floods 
in its history, particularly in the early 1900s, 
the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. The flood of 1993 
devastated many states in the Midwest The 
Mississippi and other rivers across the Mid- 
west slowly began to rise in March and April, 
and began overflowing in the summer. 

"The big thing with last year's flooding 
was we got a lot of rain in a short period of 
time,'' Joe Winters, a Cedar Rapids weather- 
man, told The Goldfinch. "The constant rain 
and clouds don't allow the sun to dry 
things out" More than forty-eight inches of 
precipitation fell on Iowa in 1993, Winters 
said, rhat's almost fifteen inches more than 
the state's annual average of precipitation. 

The flood of 1993 knocked out water 
supplies in Des Moines for nineteen days. In 
eastern Iowa, the citizens of Chelsea were 
forced to evacuate their town. Cities and 
towns all over the state faced constant rain 
and flooding as Iowa's rivers raged on. 
Many Iowans relied on rowboats and 
canoes for transportation. Flood victims and 
volunteers from around the country 
prepared thousands of bags of sand, built 
levees, and shared precious resources, like 
bottled water and food. When the flood 
waters finally died down, seven Iowans 
had lost their lives, and millions of dollars

worth of homes, businesses, crops, and 
personal property were lost 

Floods are like no other natural disaster. 
Tornadoes and blizzards come and go. Snow 
can be shoveled. But flood water stays in 
fields, roads, and buildings until it flows 
out, evaporates, or is pumped out Iowans 
can learn from the floods of the past to 
prepare for future natural disasters. 

"The areas that normally flood every 
year will experience some flooding again 
this year," Winters said. "The soil moisture 
is still pretty high and if we get a lot of 
heavy spring rains we could get some more 
flooding. But it's really too soon to predict" 
— Amy Ruth, with special thanks 
to Andy Reddick. 

What You Can Do 

Many Iowans are still struggling with the 
effects of the flood of 1993. Call the Red Cross 
office in your community and ask what you 
can do to help. Volunteer to fill sandbags if 
flooding returns to Iowa this year.

It was happening while you were in the first 
grade. It was happening while you were at a 
friend's house last week. It is happening as you 
read this issue of The Goldfinch. Soil erosion is 
a part of yesterday, today, and tomorrow. 

Soil erosion, the wearing away of the earth's 
surface by wind and rain, has built and is 
tearing down many land forms we see today. 
Think of a hill youVe climbed or seen recently. 
A glacier, the wind, or water may have helped 
shape that hill thousands of years ago. Every 
day, a little piece of it gets carried away by wind 
and water. This is natural erosion. 

A Recipe for Healthy Soil 

Nature makes soil every day to replace 
what is carried away by erosion. First, wind, 
and water break rocks into tiny grains. Tiny air 
pockets form between these grains. Then re- 
mains of dead plants and animals add nutrients 
to the newly formed soil. Finally, new plants 
grow in the soil Roots take in the air and 
nutrients while helping the soil remain in place. 

A good batch of soil attracts earthworms, 
ants, spiders, and even rabbits and mice 
looking for underground homes. Humans 
depend on soil to grow food and store water. 

14 The Goldfinch J 5 



Sometimes old soil is blown or washed 
away before new soil can take its place. This • 
less of soil is called accelerated erosion. Many 
consider accelerated erosion one of Iowa's 
most serious environmental concerns. 

Farming the Soil in iowa 

American Indians were the first Iowa 
farmers. More than a thousand years ago, 
they grew crops in the soft, sandy soil along 
Iowa river bottoms. 

When pioneers came to Iowa in the 1830s, 
they cut down trees and broke through the 
soil. They plowed up the native prairie vegeta- 
tion. The strong roots of these plants snapped 
and popped as plows broke them. Iowa's soil 

— once protected by trees and prairie grasses 

— stood exposed to wind and water. 
Over the years, more and more land was 

used to grow crops. The amount of Iowa land 
planted with corn and beans increased from 
one million acres in 1860, to 21 million acres 
in 1989. The amount of topsoil on this 
unprotected land decreased. Land that was 
once covered by sixteen inches of rich soil 
now is covered by as little as one or two 
inches in some areas.

After every rain storm or wind gust, Iowa's 
land lost more soil. Soil clogged ditches. Soil- 
filled streams killed fish and polluted drinking 
water. 

Soil in the Air and in the Water 

In the 1930s, Iowa did not get enough rain. 
Wind and water easily carried away the dry 
soil. People were concerned because so much 
soil was being lost Donald E. Fish, who lived 
in Iowa in the 1930i . . sver forgot how much 
soil dust was in the air one day in 1933. 

"I remember one warm day in May 1933. 1 
drove all over the country with my lights on 
and my windows rolled up because of a dust 
storm. All that day you couldn't see the sun. 
Sometimes the clouds were almost red. If it 
rained, the first rain that came down looked 
like red paint," he said. 

Today, the Soil Conservation Service 
studies the causes and effects of soil erosion. 
Wind and water cause most of the erosion in 
Iowa. Crops grow less food when ri<\i 
nutrients and water needed by p'luts are lost 
by soil erosion. More and more soil stands 
exposed to the wind and water. 

Other programs control erosion and help 
Iowa farmers protect the soil. The Iowa Soil 
2000 Program shows farmers how to protect 
the soil so it stays in place rather than eroding 
away. The 1992 Cost Sharing Program helps 
farmers find and pay for ways to protect soil. 

Protecting Iowa's Soil 

Conservationists recommend that 
farmers plow and drive over their fields as 
little as possible. Leaving old plants on the 
field during winter protects the soil and adds 
nutrients to it Growing grass or hay on steep,

easily eroded hills instead of crops also 
prevents rain from washing away the earth. 

Farmers aren't the only people who need to 
control erosion. According to Bill Brewer of 
the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land 
Stewardship, erosion also occurs near towns 
and construction sites. Water runs rapidly off 
sidewalks, roads, and pavement, rather than 
soaking into the ground. Construction sites 
leave large amounts of soil uncovered, 
resulting in soil loss. 

Every Iowan should be concerned and 
learn about soil erosion. Soil is a valuable 
resource that provides us with food and water. 
It provides a place for animals and insects to 
live. Soil that is protected today will provide 
what we need for many years to come.

Iowa's Prairie History 



The grass grew so tall that a child walking 
through it seemed to disappear. Bright 
flowers and singing birds added color and 
music to the land. Almost all of Iowa was once a 
prairie, covered with grasses and plants. There 
were few bushes and trees except for forests 
along rivers and streams. 



Native Americans often lived in the river 
valleys where they could find wood and water. On 
the prairies, they hunted deer and elk and gath- 
ered plants for food and medicine. 

In the 1830s European-American settlers 
started moving west towards Iowa, When they 
were allowed to enter Iowa in 1833, they avoided 




European-American settlers adapted to Iowa's prairie environment. They learned how to plow the prairie and built homes 
and shelters for their families and animals.

the prairies. They built their homes along rivers 
and streams. Like Native Americans, they needed 
water and timber for houses, fences, and fuel. 

Some settlers thought that prairie soil was not 
rich and fertile enough snd would not grow good 
crops. If trees did not grow there, how could corn 
and wheat survive? 

When settlers had purchased all the wooded 
land along rivers and streams, only prairie land 
was left to buy. Settlers then discovered that 
prairies could be 
formed and that the 
black soil would grow 
good crops. 



Breaking the Prairie 

Because the prairie 
had never been plowed 
before, breaking the 
land was the first 
priority, The tall 
grasses and plants had 
tough and tangled 
roots. The settlers had 
to cut the tall grass 
and then plow through 
the mass of roots. 

Breaking the prairie 
was hard work. Some settlers hired special crews 
of workers who brought their o wn oxen and 
plow. A dozen oxen pulled the huge, heavy 
breaking plow. The moist soil clung to the plow- 
share. Thick roots dulled its edge. Every few feet 
the workers stopped to scrape off the soil and to 
sharpen the share. 

Breaking the prairie was easier after a new 



Fires spread across Iowa's prairies in the fall Settlers 
and travelers who depended on the prairies for food and 
shelter did not welcome the fires. 



plow was invented. The new plow was smaller 
and could be pulled by only two or three horses 
and oxen. The plowshare was made of polished 
steel that cut through the roots easily. The soil 
did not stick to the steel. Now one person could 
do the work of an entire crew. 

A Land of Fire 

The settlers soon discovered that fires burned 
the prairies in the autumn when the grass was 

dry . The fires were good 
for these grasslands 
because they allowed the 
prairie plants to grow 
back stronger in the 
spring. 

But prairie fires were 
bad for settlers, their 
homes, and farms. As 
they worked, settlers 
watched the horizon for 
smoke or a reddish haze 
that signaled a prairie 
I fire. 

* A prairie fire could 
start easily from a 
forgotten campfire, 
lightning, or a careless 
person. Prairie fires often were started on pur- 
pose to clear the land, and could easily burn 
beyond control. If there was no wind, the fire 
burned slowly. It looked like a red line creeping 
along the countryside. But on windy days, the fire 
roared across the prairie for miles. 

Settlers protected their property by plowing 
fire strips around them. When the flames reached 



ERIC 



of the 



20 



The Goldfinch 19 



the strip of plowed ground, there was nothing to 
catch fire. The fire could not burn on bare soil. 

More Fields, More Farms 

Each year the settlers learned more about 
living on the prairie. Better farm equipment 
made plowing and planting easier. Each year 
farmers stayed in Iowa, they plowed and planted 
more fields. As trains brought lumber to towns, 
families bought wood and built bigger houses. 
They planted trees to shade their houses in the 



summer and to stop the winds of winter. The 
prairies were almost gone. Without miles of dried 
grasses in autumn, fires did not start so easily or 
burn so much. By the 1880s, Iowa was covered 
with farms, towns, and cities.

Prairies 
Today 

In 1846, the year Iowa became 
a state, more than 30 million 
acres of prairies covered the 
land. The tall prairies were home 
to more than 300 different kinds 
of plants that thrived in the thick 
grasses. Big Blue Stem, little 
Blue Stem, and Indian Grass 
grew as toll as six feet and had 
roots thei grew deep under the 
soil. 

The prairies prevented soil 
erosion (see story on page 14) 
and many animals lived off its 
grasses and plants. 

Today, roughly 30,000 acres 
of native prairies exist in Iowa, 
John Pearson of the Iowa 
Department of Natural Re- 
sources (JDNK) told The Gold- 
finch. These preserved native 
prairies, which have never been 
planted or used to graze farm 
animals, survive mostly in the 



the IDNR and private organizations 
protect Iowa's remaining prairies so 
that all may enjoy and learn from 
them.

Rain fell on ten-year-old Joe Rhodes in dull 
drops as he lugged two bulging bags of 
aluminum cans and a bundle of newspapers 
across his backyard to the storage shed. 

"It would have to rain," he grumbled as his 
foot struggled wit:h the shed door. Once inside, 
he dropped the cans and papers to the floor. 
The shed was almost bursting with the 
recyclable materials he'd collected in the last 
week. 

He hated dirty cans and newspapers. He'd 
omy been out of school for an hour and a half 
and already he was sticky and grimy. He 
hadn't wanted to get involved with the school 
recycling program in the first place, but his 
parents wanted him to get to know the 
neighbors and kids in his class.

The Rhodes family had moved to Ames, 
Iowa six months ago when Joe's mother 
accepted a teaching position at the state 
university. Joe hadn't made any friends yet. 
He met with the recycling group before school 
every Wednesday, but still felt like the new kid 
in town. The truth was, he missed his friends 
back in California. Most of all, he missed the 
fun they had swimming, water-skiing, and 
surfing. 

Sighing, Joe pushed his wavy brown hair 
from his eyes. He wiped his hands on his 
damp jeans and decided to get it over with. It 
was Friday afternoon, and he was looking 
forward to sprawling on his bed with a bowl of 
popcorn and an adventure novel. Moving to 
the door, he pulled a piece of crumpled paper 
from his pocket. He glanced at it and groaned

before he quickly baUed it up and stuffed it 
back in his pocket. 

"Oh well," he said aloud. "Better get going." 

He walked out of the shed, back through the 
tangled wet grass in the backyard, and down 
the driveway. He was going to see the last 
person on his list. Every day after school for 
three weeks, Joe had visited the families in his 
neighborhood with a notebook and pamphlets 
stuffed in his pocket and a pencil tucked 
behind his ear. 

He would sit politely on their couches, 
explain the importance of recycling, and 
persuade them to let him pick up their 
aluminum cans and newspapers. Every 
Saturday morning, he and his father would 
load the pickup truck with the recyclable 
materials and drive to the recycling center. His 
father would back the truck up to the bins and 
swing Joe up on the truck bed. Side by side, 
they'd toss newspapers and cans into the bins. 
When they were done, they'd treat themselves 
to a breakfast of pancakes topped with syrupy 
strawberries. 

But right now, Joe had to go see Mrs. 
McGrath. 

He thought Mrs. McGrath was weird. She 
wore bright pant suits splashed with bold 
flowers and almost always went barefoot. The 
Rhodes often saw her working in her garden, 
pulling long weeds from the ground, or gently 
pruning her pink roses. She'd always smile and 
wave from under floppy hats. Sometimes she 
talked to her cats. Once, Joe thought he heard 
Mrs. McGrath talking to herself. 

Joe walked slowly up the front path to the 
small, ranch-style house. He hesitated at the 
door and drew in a deep breath betore he rang 
the bell. 



In an instant, Mrs. McGrath appeared at the 
door in fuzzy pink slippers and a purple pant 
suit dotted with white d assies. 

"Oh child," she fussed, sweeping Joe inside. 
"It's raining out there. You're soaking wet." 
Mrs. McGrath smiled broadly and led Joe into 
a large living room, stuffed to the corners with 
thick, dark furniture and plush chairs. Stacks 
of old newspapers tied with strings, bundles of 
envelopes, and dozens of jars filled with 
pennies lined the floor and tables. 

Joe settled himself in a green easy chair in 
the middle of the room. "Now you just wait 
right here, dear," Mrs. McGrath said. She 
disappeared out of the room, singing softly, 
"Hey, diddle-diddle-hey-ho, hey, diddle- 
diddle-hey-hum." 

"Oh boy," thought Joe as he looked around 
the crowded room. "Mrs. McGrath sure needs 
a lesson in recycling. Good thing I showed up 
today." 

The living room was large but seemed 
smaller because it was so cramped. A bay 
window looked out into the front garden and 
Joe smiled at a gray cat curled up happily on 
the window seat. A small, green bird chirped 
loudly in a cage in the corner of the room, but 
the cat only stretched lazily and resumed his 
nap. 

Mrs. McGrath returned a few minutes later 
with two steaming mugs of tea. Actually, they 
were old jelly Jars made of thick glass, like the 
antique pop bottles Joe's dad collected. 

Joe accepted the jar and took a tiny sip. 
Setting his drink on the coffee table, he 
cleared his throat and began his rehearsed 
speech. 

"My name is Joe Rhodes," he said 
mechanically. Tm helping the planet by

recvding newspapers and aluminum cans." 
He reached across the coffee table to the 
coucr. and handed Mrs. McGrath a pamphlet. 
"But I can't do it alone," he continued. "I need 
your zelp. If you'll agree to participate in the 
Greerwood Elementary School recycling 
prognm, I'll come to your house once a week 
and "nek up your recyclable goods." 

Hr took another sip of tea. Mrs. McGrath 
smiled and shook her head. 

"Tnank you, child. But as much as I'd like 
to heo. I have to say no." 




Joe couldn't believe he had been turned 
down. Everyone els* he'd visited had agreed to 
help. He thought for a moment, quickly 
skimming a pamphlet. He wasn't prepared for 
rejection. 

"Bui-Mrs. McGrath, " he sputtered. 
"Recycling is so-oo important. Without it, our 
planet will soon run out of its natural 
resources, and then we'll all be in trouble." 

"Oh my, child," Mrs. McGrath said, crossing 
her long, purple legs. "Now you can't put all 
that on me. I do my part, you know. Recycling 
means reusing, and I reuse everything! I use 
my newspapers to line nv bird cage and for 
packing material when I send gifts to my 
grandchildren in Canada." 

Then she motioned to the jars of tea on the 
coffee table. "You see those? I haven't bought 
new glasses or cups since 1947. These jars are 
so thick, they keep lemonade nice and icy cold 
in the summer, and hold tea and coffee just 
fine." 

Before Joe could respond, Mrs, McGrath 
stood up and walked across the room to a desk 
piled high with papers and knick-knacks. 
She'd almost emptied two drawers when she 
found what she was looking for. She returned 
to the couch and placed a topless cigar box on 
the coffee table. She pulled a handful of 
rubber bands from her pants poc et and 
strung them around the box. She ran her 
finger across the bands. "Twang, twing, wrang, 
wwong." 

Mrs, McGrath laughed and laughed, and 
Joe couldn't hold back a smile, 

"This, my dear, is a home-made guitar. Used 
to keep me and my five sisters and brothers 
entertained for hours."

Joe was getting curious now. His teacher 
hadn't told him about this kind of recycling. 
"Where did you learn how to do all this?" he 
asked enthusiastically. "No one told me about 
reusing old jelly jars and making guitars." 

Mrs. McGrath laughed, her slim frame 
shaking till she almost teetered over. "Oh child, 
oh child. I grew up in the Great Depression. 
The worst times this country has ever seen. 
BacK home in Nebraska, times were hard for 
farmer families like mine. We were poor, child, 
but we were smart, too. We put our heads 
together and didn't want for anything." 

Joe reached for his tea and rearranged 
himself in the chair. He was getting 
comfortable because he wanted to know more. 
"What else did your family do?" he asked, 
shyly. 

Mrs. McGrath settled back in the couch, 
stroking a black and white kitten who had 
emerged from the cushions. "Well, in the 
summer, we didn't wear shoes. We saved them 
for winter when we really needed them. But I 
remember one fall, our shoelaces wore out, 
almost all at the same time. We couldn't afford 
new ones. Momma would tie them back 
together as best she could, but they'd just 
break again. One day, on our way home from 
school, my oldest brother, Erwin, spotted a big 
red and yellow kite in a pine tree. Now my 
brother Erwin was a smart one. He grabbed th« 
trunk of the tree and shook and shook. Sure 
enough, that kite fell to the ground. Erwin 
knew that kite string is made of strong, durable 
material. The next day, we all had new 
shoelaces." 





Joe pulled his notebook out of his pocket. ^ , 
He didn't want to forget a word Mrs. McGrath* 
was telling him. "Tell me more," he begged. 

Mrs. McGrath was happy to reply. "Do you 
ever get nifty cards in the mail on your 
birthday?" 

Joe nodded, his pencil perched above his 
noteoook in a ready position. 

"Well," continued Mrs. McGrath. "If there's 
no writing on the back of the side where the 
picture is, you can cut the card in two, along 
the spine and viola! You have a postcard." 

Joe crinkled his forehead until his eyebrows 
almost touched. "I always throw my cards 
away, so do my parents." 

Mrs. McGrath ndded knowingly. "Lots of 
people do, you knovv. But it's never too late to 
start recycling and reusing." 

Joe wrote "postcards," "cigar box guitar," 
and "jelly jars" in his notebook while Mrs. 
McGrath stood up and stretched her legs. She

smiled and motioned for Joe to follow her out 
of the living room. 

"Come with me and I'll show you some 
more," she said over her shoulder. Joe leapt up 
and followed her into the kitchen. It was 
equally as cluttered. Glass jars, newspapers, 
and coffee cans covered with pretty paper 
stood on the counters. 

"What do you use the coffee cans for?" Joe 
asked. 

Mrs. McGrath reached for one and took off 
the lid. "This one is for sugar." She snapped 
the lid back on and pointed to the other cans. 
"That one is for flour. I keep tea bags in the 
third one, and I fill the fourth one with cookies 
when my grandchildren visit." 

While Joe wrote "coffee can canisters" in his 
notebook, Mrs. McGrath opened a door and 
flipped on a light. They walked down the stairs 
to the cellar and Mrs. McGrath pointed to rows 
and rows of boxes bursting with bunches of 
twigs and tree branches. Joe felt as if they had 
just walked into a forest. 

"This is my firewood," Mrs. McGrath 
explained, patting the boxes. "I gather these 
in the fall and they dry out real nice down 
here. Bundle them together tightly with vines, 
and they'll burn longer. These twigs fall from 
the trees in my backyard. Many people cut 
down trees for firewood. Not me! By the time 



it gets cold, I know I'll be toasty warm with my 
twigs crackling in the fireplace." 

Joe flipped to a blank page in his notebook, 
writing, "Tell mom to cancel firewood guy." 

The two returned to the first floor. Joe's 
clothes had dried out, and he realized ne was 
almost late for dinner. 

As Mrs. McGrath walked him to the door, 
Joe had an idea. 

"Hey, why don't you come to my school 
and give a talk about recycling! The kids 
would love hearing about the jelly jars and the 
guitar and the postcards!" 

"Well, okay," said Mrs. McGrath, "but only 
if you promise to keep visiting. Come by next 
weekend, and I'll show you how I make 
fertilizer for my garden." 

Joe agreed enthusiastically and hugged his 
new friend before scurrying home. The rain 
had stopped, and he ran happily up the 
driveway, singing, "Hey, diddle-diddle-hey 
-ho, hey, diddle-diddle-hey-hum." 

He banged in through the kitchen door with 
such energy that his mother came running out 
of her study where she had been grading 
papers. "Hi, honey," she said, "anything 
wrong?" 

Joe answered her with a wide grin, and his 
mother's face relaxed into a smile. "Did you 
get Mrs. McGrath to help with the recycling 
program?" 

"Did I ever!" Joe answered, pulling his 
notebook from his pocket. "You know those 
jelly jars we never reuse, and the birthday 
cards we throw away? Well, do 1 have some 
neat ideas for you!" (J)

Theresa Carbrey of rural Johnson County 
was one of 20 million people across the 
country who spent April 22, 1970, con- 
centrating on the environment. This first 
Earth Day was organized to encourage Amer- 
icans to think about environmental issues. 
Earth Day is still celebrated on April 22. 

Theresa described the first Earth Day as 
an assortment of speeches, rallies, tree 
plantings, and pranks. 

"Back then you could easily gather a 
crowd of 3,000 people for rallies in Iowa 
City," Theresa said. "I was a hippie then. 
Hippies are who brought us Earth Day." 

Hippies were people in the 1960s and 
1970s who were concerned with many 
issues, including war, the environment, 
and Americans 1 dependence on material 
things like cars and money. They 
questioned the belief that making money 
was the number one goal. 

Environmental concerns quickly spread 
beyond the hippie community. 
"Environmental issues became important 
to a wide range of people after the first 
Earth Day," Theresa remembered. 

Demonstrations on April 22, 1970, drew 
attention to pollution threatening land, 



water, and air. People began to think more 
about saving the earth's natural resources 
— trees, oceans, soil, and plants and 
animals. Theresa said she grew more 
concerned about the environment after 
participating in the first Earth Day. 

"I found peace and harmony and 
wished to align myself with what I saw 
in nature," Theresa said. 

Like Mother, Like Son 

Today, Theresa and her nine-year-old 
son, Justin Webb, live in a little cabin in the 
woods along the Iowa River. As they 
talked to The Goldfinch on a snowy January 
afternoon, icicles dripped from the frame of 
the cabin, and Canada geese honked noisily 
as they fltw above the churning river. 

Theresa and Justin's front yard is a 
riverbank full of living things, even in the 
dead of winter. Rabbit and squirrel tracks 
dotted the newly fallen snow. Theresa 
pointed out young trees scarred by beavers 
who sharpen their long teeth on the trunks. 
When they're done, the trees look like 
sharpened, stubby pencils. 




Justin and his mother, Theresa Carbrey, inspect 
beaver markings on a tree in their front yard.

A hollow cottonwood tree is Justin's 
hideout He shares it with wildlife, like the 
mice whose tracks he found when he 
crawled inside. Nearby is an ancient silver 
maple tree where raccoons gather. 

While other kids 
his age hang out at 
malls and arcades, 
Justin prefers the 
peaceful riverbank, 
the hunt for tracks of 
deer and coyote, and 
the excitement of 
seeing an eagle soar 
above him. 

At Work and at Play 

Theresa's de- 
votion to the environ- 
ment also can be 
found in her choice of 
careers. She directs 
educational programs, 
writes a newsletter, 
and researches 
environmental issues 

for New Pioneer Co-op, a fresh food market 
in Iowa City. 

In addition to her job, Theresa also is 
involved in many other environmental 
activities. She participates in organic 
growersworkshops and water-quality 
seminars, and helps with creek clean-ups and 
educational recycling programs. Last year, 
she won a Governor's Volunteer Service 
Award for her efforts to preserve nongame 
species in Iowa. 

Together, Theresa and Justin help Iowa's 
environment by attending local rallies and 
Earth Day celebrations. 




Justin Webb of rural Johnson County shares 
his tree-trunk hideout with mite and other 
wildlife. 



For one of her recent Earth Day projects, 
Theresa and an environmental group plant- 
ed a small tall-grass prairie near the Co-op. 

We're a prairie state, yet few people knov 
the native prairie species," she said. 

The volunteers put 
small signs in the prairie 
to identify the plants and 
grasses that once covered 
Iowa. 

"Our little prairie 
attracts butterflies," 
Theresa said proudly. 
"Now we're just waiting 
for buffalo!" 

For the last twenty-four 
years, Earth Day has 
happened just once a 
year, but the ideas and 
concerns behind it 
encourage people to 
help the environment 
every day. 

People like Theresa 
and Justin.
