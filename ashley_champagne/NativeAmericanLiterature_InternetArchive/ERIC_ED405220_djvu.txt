Preface 



In the Fall 1994, when Pete Rubba proposed to the AETS Board of Directors that the 
association publish conference proceedings, the proceedings were conceived as a record of 
AETS annual meetings. Papers presented at and summaries of presentations made at AETS 
annual meetings would be included. The proceedings initially would be disseminated via the 
ERIC Clearinghouse for Science, Mathematics and Environmental Education in microfiche and 
hard copy form, and eventually also on the AETS World Wide Web Site. Given ERIC 
documents and web materials are not copyrighted, AETS presenters would be able to submit 
papers and presentation summaries published in the proceedings to journals such as the Journal 
of Science Teacher Education and Science Education. 

Forty-three papers and presentation summaries from the 1997 AETS Annual Meeting in 
Cincinnati, OH were submitted for inclusion in the 1997 AETS Conference Proceedings. In 
reviewing them, we mainly made suggestions on ways to enhance clarity and formatting. 
Because the proceedings are to serve as the record of an AETS annual meeting, the papers and 
presentation summaries were not refereed. 

The Proceedings of the 1997 Annual International Conference of the Association for the 
Education of Teachers in Science, includes a copy of the conference program and 43 papers and 
presentation summaries from the meeting, ordered by conference session. We are pleased to 
have had the opportunity to edit the 1997 AETS Conference Proceedings.

1997 AETS ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL MEETING PROGRAM 



1997 AETS ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL MEETING 
JANUARY 9-12, 1997 

OMNI NETHERLAND PLAZA - CINCINNATI, OHIO 



Welcome to the 1997 Annual AETS Meeting in Cincinnati, Ohio. The Omni Netherland Plaza, a National Historic 
Landmark and Cincinnati’s most critically acclaimed hotel, is located in the heart of downtown Cincinnati near a variety 
of diverse attractions. The hotel, across from Fountain Square, is part of the Carew Tower complex and adjacent to 
Tower Place - a myriad of fine stores, shops, entertainment, and eateries. The city’s famous sky walk system connects the 
hotel to the convention center, downtown commercial district, and other downtown shopping, dining, and recreation. The 
hotel is within walking distance to Riverfront Stadium, Coliseum, Music Hall, Taft Theater, and the Amoff Center. The 
Omni Netherland Plaza is itself a tourist attraction, boasting such priceless treasures as the renowned Hall of Mirrors, 
one acre of rare Brazilian Rosewood paneling, and spectacular ceiling murals. We hope you enjoy your accommoda- 
tions, the meeting facility, and Cincinnati’s nearby attractions during your conference stay! 

The sponsors for this conference are Delta Education, Miami University, and Colorado College. As a member of AETS 
and a conference attendee, please let these sponsors know how much you appreciate their support of AETS. 

Sincerely, The Conference Planning Committee 

A Special Conference Welcome by AETS President, Paul J. Kuerbis 

Welcome to Cincinnati and to the fifth annual AETS International conference! We owe the entire conference planning 
team our sincere thanks and appreciation for the work they have done in putting together a superb program. The ultimate 
success of the conference, however, is determined by each of you, individually and collectively. Many of you contributed 
to the design of the conference through thoughtful and pertinent paper and special session proposals. All of you will 
contribute through your constructive comments and real dialogue (not just discussion) during each of the sessions and in 
the hallways and byways of the convention locale. In the short time we have been having annual conferences we have 
become known as a group of thoughtful colleagues who have gathered to share ideas and research and to learn as much 
as we can from each other. I want to encourage your complete participation in the conference by also inviting you to 
drop in on committee and board meetings and to let the leadership know how you can contribute to the fulfillment of the 
AETS mission: to promote leadership in, and support 
those involved in, the professional development of teachers of science. 

Sincerely, Paul J. Kuerbis, 1996 President

PRE-CONFERENCE WORKSHOP 

Classroom-Based, Embedded Assessment in Science Salon B 

Classroom-based, embedded assessment is a significant way for science teachers to improve their teaching and student 
learning in science classes. Through research and development sponsored by NSF and Michigan State University, a 
process and support materials have been developed to assist middle school science teachers in adding this form of 
assessment to their repertoire of skills. The experience of developers suggests that the approach can also be effectively 
used by elementary and high school teachers. During this workshop science teacher educators will be introduced to the 
materials and approach. Join us and discuss plans to consider build a community of science teacher educators to pursue 
this work further and explore teacher change through these assessment techniques. Limited to 40 participants.

1997 AETS ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL MEETING PROGRAM 



AETS CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS TO BE PUBLISHED 

Papers presented at and summaries of presentations made at the 1997 AETS Annual Meeting in Seattle can be submitted 
for inclusion in the Conference Proceedings. The Conference Proceedings will serve as a record of the AETS Annual 
Meeting. It will be published as an ERIC document through the ERIC Clearinghouse for Science, Mathematics and 
Environmental Education. Microfiche and hard copies of the Proceedings will be available through the Clearinghouse, as 
are all other ERIC documents. 

The 1997 AETS Conference Proceedings will be edited by Peter A. Rubba, Patricia F. Keig and James A. Rye. 

Please note that papers presented at and summaries of presentations made at the 1997 AETS Annual Meeting may be 
submitted for inclusion in the Conference Proceedings in one of two ways: by dropping three copies in a box at the 
registration table at the 1997 AETS Annual Meeting, or by sending three copies to the first editor (Rubba) so they arrive 
within 30 days following the meeting. 

PLEASE NOTE: 

a) The name, address, phone and FAX numbers, and e-mail address of the submitting author should appear on a 
cover page (information on other authors also may appear) and 

b) Two self-addressed and stamped envelopes must be included — ONE, A BUSINESS ENVELOPE AND THE 
OTHER, AN ENVELOPE LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD ONE COPY OF THE PAPER. 

• The 1997 AETS Conference Proceedings will not be refereed, nor will they be copyrighted. This will allow 
authors to submit papers and presentation summaries included in the Proceedings to journals such as the 
Journal of Science Teacher Education and Science Education. 

• Papers and presentation summaries will be reviewed by the Proceedings’ editors with suggested modifications 
noted on one of the submitted hard copies. This marked copy will be returned to the author who submitted it 
with a request that the paper or presentation summary be revised and resubmitted by a specified date. Three 
camera-ready copies prepared according to format specifications will be requested. The anticipated format 
specifications are presented below for those who wish to use them in preparing papers for the meeting. The 
final format specifications may differ slightly. These will be sent with the marked copy of the paper or presenta- 
tion summary. 

• Review by the editors is anticipated to take at least two months. Authors will be given about a month to revise, 
format and resubmit. It is anticipated that the editors will submit the Proceedings to the ERIC Clearinghouse in 
May or June. At that time authors will be notified of citation information. If feasible, the Proceedings also will 
be placed on the AETS Site. If that possibility arises, authors will be asked to submit both hard and disk copies 
of revised papers. 

• The editors reserve the right to not include in the Conference Proceedings, for example: a) documents that do 
not resemble what is generally considered a ’’paper” or ’’presentation summary” (overheads used in a presenta- 
tion, tables, figures and reference lists without explanatory text), b) papers or presentation summaries not 
prepared in final version using the specified format, and c) papers or presentation summaries not submitted by a 
deadline. 

Additional information on submitting for inclusion in the Conference Proceedings is available at the conference 
Registration Desk or by contacting Peter A. Rubba..

Introduction 

Many elementary school teachers realize that more and more hands-on activities is not the 
solution to unsatisfactory science literacy. The process-product debate of the 1960s reform in 
which alphabet science programs exclusively promoted hands-on concrete discovery activities was 
not successful for about 75% of elementary school teachers. The uncertainty of unstructured 
explorations, the discount of language in favor of sensory experiences, and the complex logistics 
of manipulatives and small groups stressed the culture of the generalist elementary teachers and 
their classroom environments. 

Today, systemic reforms like Science — Parents, Activities and Literature (Science PALs) 
in the Iowa City Community School District are attempting to implement science as inquiry focused 
on science literacy in a much more user-friendly fashion. Science literacy involves the abilities and 
dispositions to construct understanding; big ideas, values and informed opinions; and the 
communication strategies to inform and persuade others. Science PALs uses children’s literature 
as assessment platforms and as springboards for inquiry. Furthermore, numerous connections 
have been made among science and the language arts. 

This paper provides a theoretical framework for reading-to-leam science and writing-to- 
leam science; outlines applications of language arts approaches, explicit reading strategies and 
writing genre that enhance science learning; and describes some of the promising uses of these

approaches for elementary school science teacher education. Each of these components is 
anchored in the National Research Council’s National Science Education Standards (NRC, 1996) 
for teaching science, content, and professional development. 



Theoretical Framework 



Constructivist approaches emphasize the importance of prior knowledge, concurrent 
experiences, multiple information sources, social negotiations of meaning and integration of new 
understandings and existing knowledge networks (Shymansky, 1994). Clearly the sensory 
experiences and the oral language arts (talking and listening to science) are well accepted by 
contemporary science education (Lemke, 1990). Oily recently have science educators begun to 
address the value of the print-based language (Santa & Alvermann, 1991; Yore, Holliday & 
Alvermann, 1994). This recognition in part is based on the realization that the elementary school 
classroom is a teaching-learning culture that emphasizes language arts, mathematics and social 
development and that the implementation of the current reforms needs to be anchored in a cross- 
curricular foundation and requires the enhancement of effective practices. 

“My students can’t read information books!” No where is this long-expressed cry more 
frequently heard than in upper elementary grades, when the emphasis clearly shifts from 
“learning to read” to “reading to learn.” Likewise, the value of writing a list to consolidate 
understanding and to improve memory and the use of webbing to illustrate hidden connections 
and internal organization of information are well accepted in the elementary school culture. 
Unfortunately, the relationships between the print-based language arts and science achievement 
are not well established, but the available “research does not support the concocted claims that 
reading and writing in science naturally inhibit students’ creativity, curiosity, and interest” 
(Holliday, 1992, p. 60). The major problem facing teacher educators is to convince prospective 
teachers and practicing teachers of the potential value of science reading and science writing 
when they have not had any experience with the integration of language arts and science and

when much of the science education literature has maligned the importance of reading and 
writing in science classrooms while exclusively extolling the value of hands-on activities. 
Reading-to-Learn Science 

A teacher’s knowledge about science text and science reading frequently determines 
whether or not print materials are used effectively. Many teachers fail to recognize the unique 
differences between narrative and expository text and cling to the traditional notions that 
meaning resides solely in the text and that readers simply extract the meaning. They 
unknowingly design instruction involving science as if science texts were narrative rather than 
expository and as if reading was a meaning- taking process rather than a meaning-making 
process (Digisi & Willett, 1995; Gottfried & Kyle, 1992; Shymansky, Yore & Good, 1991). 

Science text, unlike the familiar content and predictable story grammar of children’s 
literature, contains unfamiliar content and text structures, heavy conceptual demands, and unique 
vocabulary. The purpose of scientific text is to assist uninformed and misinformed readers 
construct meaning about specific science ideas using an expository approach, words (concept 
labels) with specific meanings, complex and interconnected sentences, and specific text 
structures (description, collection, compare/contrast, problem/solution, causation). 

Reading is not simply a unidimensional bottom-up or top-down process involving printed 
symbols. Rather, reading is an interactive-constructive process that involves making meaning by 
negotiating understanding between the text and the reader’s concurrent experiences and 
memories of the topic within a sociocultural context (Yore Sl Shymansky, 1991). The 
interactive-constructive model of science reading recognizes the importance of prior knowledge, 
strategies, metacognition (awareness and executive control of meaning making), and 
sociocultural context. 

The interactive-constructive model discounts the beliefs that expert readers differ from 
novice readers simply in the number of decoding skills acquired or that meaning is simply 
embedded in the text An efficient, successful science reader is a strategic person who is aware 
of, flexible, and manages several sources of information, science text, meaning making and the 




42 54 



selection, use, and substitution of several strategies (Craig & Yore, 1995). Flood (1986) 
metaphorically described the role of printed language in the construction of understanding as the 
way a contractor uses blueprints in the construction of a building. Flood stated: 

Texts establish broad limits of possible meanings, but they do not specify a single 
meaning. Readers (not texts) create meaning through negotiations with authors, (p. 784) 
Readers progressively resolve conflicting meanings involving text-based interpretations extracted 
from print, recalled ideas from the reader’s memory, and shared ideas from the sociocultural 
context (Craig & Yore, 1996). The reader’s recollections might involve different types of 
knowledge: topic, language structures, science text, and scientific enterprise (Alexander & 
Kulikowich, 1994). Sociocultural context includes the values, beliefs, opinions, and attitudes 
inherent in the learning environment. 

How readers construct understanding appears to be influenced by the readers’ prior 
knowledge, metacognitive awareness, executive control, and access to information rather than 
the source of information. 

To comprehend what we are taught verbally, or what we read, or what we find out by 
watching a demonstration or doing an experiment, we must invent a model or explanation 
for it that organizes the information selected from the experience in a way that makes 
sense to us, that fits our logic or real world experiences, or both. (Osborne & Wittrock, 
1983, p.493) 

“Knowledge use and control are at the heart of the knowledge-construction process through 
purpose setting, planning and organizing, and constructing meaning” (Ruddell & Unrau, 1994, p. 
1022 ). 

Expert science readers have metacognitive knowledge about science reading, science text, 
and specific science reading strategies. Several strategies critical to constructing meaning have 
been identified; they are frequently absent in ineffective readers but respond to instruction (Dole, 
Duffy, Rochler & Pearson, 1991; Pressley, Johnson, Symons, McGoldrick & Kurita, 1989). They 
include:

1. Assessing the importance of text-based information and prior knowledge. 

2. Generalizing questions to set purpose. 

3. Summarizing. 

4. Inferring meaning. 

5. Monitoring comprehension. 

6. Utilizing text structure. 

7. Reading and reasoning critically. 

8. Improving memory. 

9. Self-regulating to fix-up comprehension failures. 

10. Skimming, elaborating, and sequencing. 

Older and better readers conceptualize reading and these strategies differently from younger and 
less able readers. Baker (1991) pointed out that able readers recognize that reading is about 
understanding and that strategies change to match purpose, utilize various standards to evaluate 
comprehension, and apply different strategies to fix-up comprehension failures. Effective readers 
have knowledge about the reading process and personally regulate their purpose, effort, and 
approach while they are reading. 

Explicit instruction on science reading strategies improves metacognitive awareness, 
reading comprehension, and science achievement (Holden, 1996; Spence, 1994). If it is to be 
successful, explicit instruction must address all parts of metacognition. Jacobs and Paris (1987) 

s' 

subdivided the metacognitive knowledge (self-appraisal) into declarative knowledge (what), 
procedural knowledge (how), and conditional knowledge (why and when). They subdivided 
control (self-management) into strategic planning, monitoring progress, and self-regulation. 
Pearson and Dole (1987) provided guidelines for effective comprehension instruction that 
develops metacognitive awareness and transfers knowledge into action. They suggest explicit 
instruction needs to be embedded in a natural context setting and that instruction should 



systematically establish need, model desired outcome, provide direct practice and consolidation, 
and encourage transfer of ownership and application. 

Writing-to Leam-Science 

“Writing-to-leam involves and emphasizes the powerful role language plays in the 
production, as well as the presentation of knowledge” (Connolly, 1989 p. 2). This rhetoric 
promotes constructivist perspectives of learning by illustrating that the symbol systems used to 
communicate also play a critical role in constructing meaning and by reflecting the unique way 
scientists communicate ideas within the scientific community. Science writing involves adopting 
appropriate rhetorical stances, text structures, and genres that accurately reflect scientific 
assumptions — such as the need for repeatability, verifiability, generalizability, and patterns of 
argumentation (evidence, warrants, claims). 

Halliday (1993) cautioned about over-emphasizing the interpretive nature of scientific 
language, disregarding the unique structure-function relationship of writing, and assuming that 
creative and narrative writing will improve science understanding. In order to enhance science 
learning and improve communication with the science community discipline-specific expository 
and personal writing tasks must match the inquiry nature of science, the evaluative view of 
knowledge, and the target learning outcomes. Unfortunately, “we must persuade a group of 
teachers who themselves did not learn science . . . this way, that writing-to-leam is not only 
useful but essential for a certain type of student” (Tobias, 1989, p. 48). 

Newell and Winograd (1989) stated that “there is atjjresent only slender empirical base 
from which to conceptualize how writing may aid learning about the topic, that is, how the 
writing process and what writers take from writing are interrelated” (p. 196). However, writing 
science appears to clarify fuzzy thinking and enhance understanding (Fellows, 1994; Keys, 1994; 
Rivard, 1996). Writing makes abstract ideas permanent and allows them to be publicly analyzed, 
dispassionately criticized, checked for precision, verified for logic, and tested for content. 
Although writing is a natural extension of speaking, communicating with an unseen audience 



ERIC 



45 




represents a significant jump in cognitive demand from face-to-face speaking with and listening 
to someone (Vygotsky, 1978). 

Teachers need to help students move from the predominant knowledge-telling writing, 
which involves converting knowledge from long-term memory into written words essentially 
unaltered, to a knowledge-transforming approach in which knowledge is actively reworked to 
improve understanding — ’’reflected upon, revised, organized, and more richly interconnected” 
(Scardamalia & Bereiter, 1986, p. 16). The knowledge-transforming model clarifies the role of 
conceptual knowledge about the target topic and of metacognitive knowledge about discourse, 
patterns of argumentation, and genre. Utilizing the knowledge-transforming model as an 
operational framework, teachers would get students to spend more time setting purpose, 
specifying audience, selecting a purpose-appropriate genre, thinking, negotiating, strategic 
planning, reacting, reflecting, and revising. Teachers would also provide explicit instruction 
embedded in the authentic context of “science as inquiry” designed to clarify what writing is; the 
purpose-specific nature of scientific genre; the interactive, constructive, generative nature of 
science language; the relationship between evidence, warrants, and claims; and what, how, when, 
and why to use specific writing strategies. The describe, explain, instruct, and argue genre appear 
to have the greatest applications to science (Gallagher, Knapp & Noble, 1993). 

Description involves personal, commonsense, and technical descriptions, information and 
scientific reports, and definitions. Frequently descriptions will be structured by time-series of 
events, scientifically established classifications or taxonomies, or accepted reporting pattern of 
information (5 Ws). Explanation involves sequencing events in temporal or causal relationships. 
Explanations attempt to link established ideas or models to observed effects by using a logical 
connective of “if this, then this.” Instruction involves logical ordering a sequence of actions to 
specify a procedure, manual, experiments, recipe, or direction. Instructions can effectively utilize 
a series of steps — short declarative statements — in which the sequence is established by tested 
science, i.e., pour acid into water before adding zinc. Argumentation involves logical ordering or 
propositions to persuade someone in an essay, discussion, debate, report, or review. Arguments 




46 58 



attempt to establish the boundaries and conditions of the issue and then to systematically 
discredit, destroy, or suppoit components of the issue to clearly disconfirm or confirm the basic 
premises. 

Howard and Barton (1986) stated the “idea is to learn to think in writing primarily for 
your own edification and then the eyes of others. This approach will enable you to use writing to 
become more intelligent to yourself— to find your meaning — as well as to communicate 
effectively with others” (p. 14). The following principles should guide the development of 
writing-to-leam tasks in science (Tchudi & Huerta, 1983): 

• Keep science content central in the writing process. 

• Help students structure and synthesize their knowledge. 

• Provide a real audience for student writers that will value, question, and provide 
supportive criticism. 

• Spend time prewriting, collecting information from various sources (concrete 
experiences, print materials, experts, electronic data banks, visuals, etc.), sharpening 
focus, and strategic planning. 

• Provide on-going teacher support, guidance, and explicit instruction. 

• Encourage revisions and redrafts based on supportive criticism to address conceptual 
questions and clarify understandings. 

• Clarify the differences between revising and editing (format, spelling, mechanics, 
grammar). 

Writing in science during the elementary school years has generally been used for evaluation and 
review purposes but not for emphasizing knowledge construction and critical thinking, and for 
stressing creative writing but not expository writing. Jan (1993) used implicit and explicit 
modelling to help students learn about the various ways language is used in science and to have 
students use print-based language to leam science. She stressed that writing in science “must not 
be relegated to mere completion of worksheets or to the recipe-type” writing tasks (p. 41). 




47 



Rather, students need to be engaged in authentic science situations that involve different writing 
forms for specific purposes and audiences. 

Unsworth and Lockhart (1994) explored how junior primary (Grade 2) teachers attempted 
to integrate print-based language arts into their science classes in two inner-city schools. They 
found writing (12%, 17%) and reading (15%, 11%) accounted for a minority of the instructional 
time in the two science classes. The writing involved a variety of tasks: factual, extending text, 
lists, and diagrams. Unfortunately, little preparatory or explicit instruction, limited to modelling 
and structured worksheets, was provided for science writing and science reading. 

Burkh alter (1995) used an instructional scaffolding dealing with persuasive writing (data, 
warrants, and claims) with grades 4 and 6 students and found significant pretest-posttest 
conceptual growth, a significant explicit instruction effect, and a significant gender effect 
favoring females. She concluded that students as young as nine years can benefit from explicit 
persuasive writing instruction. 

Bergin (1995) explored a combined reading-writing approach to teaching summarizing. 
She stated: 

The cognitive operations involved in summarizing include knowing how to select, 
condense and transform information. Selecting information involves identifying 
information which is relevant and important. Condensing involves synthesizing 
information so that the structurally important information is gleaned; and in order to 
transform information, students must relate main ideas to each other and reconstruct a 
meaning which is concise but representative of the original text’s structure and content. 

(p. 30) 

These cognitive operations have been demonstrated to be part of an expert scientist’s and science 
learner’s repertoire. Bergin found that students improved their ability to select and combine main 
ideas when the instruction provided an effective framework, active role, and encouraged self- 
regulation and improved skills.

Children’s Literature as Assessment Platforms and Springboards for Inquiry 

Children's literature such as Goldilocks and the Three Bears. Porker's Taxi . The Hungry 
Caterpillar and Who Sank the Boat provide excellent platforms and springboards for science. 
Each of these stories include common misconceptions or interesting problems about 
thermodynamics, work and energy, life cycles, and buoyancy concepts embedded in a natural 
context for children. 

Science PALs utilizes science-oriented children's literature as the central focus of 
bookbags designed to engage parents and children in an assessment of prior knowledge. The 
book serves as an assessment platform and a structured interview protocol consisting of 4 to 7 
questions guides the parent-child discussion. The discussions are enriched by hands-on activities 
that have minimal equipment requirements included in the bookbag. 

Parent involvement is often cited as the single best way to improve student achievement 
and interest in school. Consistent evidence exists to show that parent encouragement, activities 
and interest at home and parent participation at school affect children's achievement even after 
the student's ability and family socioeconomic status is taken into account. Students learn best 
when parents actively monitor and suppoit their school work. In addition, students benefit from 
the interactions with parents and guardians provided by the hands-on science experiences, 
together with conversations about what is occurring. 

Making parents productive partners in education benefits teachers, as well as parents and 
students. Science PALs teachers value parent involvemenun school in both instructional and 
noninstructional capacities and frequently have the opportunity to communicate with parents 
about students and school events. Through involvement with school, parents gain first-hand 
information about what their child is experiencing and learning and become strong advocates for 
school and collaborative problem-solvers when needed. 

Therefore, asking parents to play a role in gathering information about students' ideas will 
be viewed as important by all involved, but this task needs to provide opportunities that are 
welcomed by both participants and that are useful to the teacher in order to be most effective.

Requirements for the parents must take into account time constraints on the part of the 
parent/care giver and the teacher must be able to easily convey the purpose and expectations 
associated with the task to the parent The Science PALs project has created opportunities for 
parent involvement that address these needs and are extremely well-received by parents and 
students. The purpose of collecting student information does more than give parents and 
children a chance to interact about what is happening at school. The information collected and 
reported are necessary resources for the constructivist teacher (Chidsey & Henriques, 1996). 

Science PALs also use children's literature as natural context to initiate science units. 
Teachers read stories to get students thinking and talking about science ideas and as inquiry 
springboards for hands-on activities. Frequently a single story will provide numerous challenges 
for students to explore. Students and teachers can simply replicate the science described in the 
story or can design experiments or plan library research to verify the science concepts used in the 
story. Upon completion of the science units, students can return to the literature to critically 
analyze the embedded concepts and to rewrite the story to achieve scientific accuracy. 

Explicit Science Reading Instruction 

Explicit science reading instruction must be embedded in the natural context of effective 
science instruction, must provide information about why and when, as well as what and how, and 
must address transfer to other science reading situations (Pressley, El-Dinary, Caskins, Schuler, 
Bergman, Almasi & Brown, 1992). Effective explicit instruction should be embedded in 
authentic learning task, teachers should model desired outcome and think-aloud to make 
metacognition public, and students should be encouraged to do the same and encouraged to take 
ownership of the strategy. Transfer of ownership and application are consistently the most 
problematic aspects of strategy instruction, but explicit application of strategies across the 
curriculum and within a discipline enhances the likelihood of transfer. Furthermore, research 
results indicate that less able readers (low-reading-ability students and male students) benefit 
most from such explicit instruction and that explicit strategy instruction improves general science 




50

reading comprehension (Spence, 1994). Unfortunately, only a small percentage of elementary 
school students receives any explicit content reading instruction. It is not surprising that many 
students find reading science texts difficult and frustrating. 

The following strategies address six areas of science reading comprehension that respond 
to strategic instruction: using surface features, prior knowledge, defining from context, 
identifying main ideas, summarizing, and recognizing text structures (Spence, 1994). 

Surface Structure and Organization 

The layout of the text, the titles of the sections, the diagrams, pictures and charts, and the 
questions posed in the text are surface features and organizational clues that aid readers’ 
comprehension. These clues provide an overview of what the text is about and what some of the 
subtopics may be. Considerate science text provides consistent layout, logical topic development, 
and pictures, graphs, tables, and illustrations to enhance the meaning constructed from the 
printed message. Visual adjuncts are anchored in the print and are clearly labelled to enhance 
clarity and connectedness. Effective science text provides advance organization of units and 
chapters and provides concrete experience with a topic prior to most reading activities. 

Prior Knowledge 

Establishing experiential background and accessing prior knowledge are critical in the 
improvement of science reading comprehension. The abstract nature of science texts dictates 
that scientific materials are not to be read in isolation from other experiences and supportive 
activities. A simple guiding principle is "do first, read later." Traditionally, teachers and 
textbooks reserve concrete explorations until after students have read the text This approach is 
justified for classroom management reasons, but it prevents the experiences from being utilized 
by students to facilitate comprehension and enrich meaning. Furthermore, this sequence 
relegates the explorations to verificational inquiries or cookbook activities that simply confirm 
what the text has stated. Reading concept-rich science material in elementary school should be 
utilized to confirm, reinforce, and enrich concepts partially developed by concrete inquiries and 
supplemented by peer pair, cooperative group, or whole class discussions. 



One way to access prior knowledge, set purpose, monitor progress, and improve science 
reading comprehension is to use the K-W-L approach, which utilizes a three-column chart to 
facilitate text processing (Ogle, 1986). K-W-L charts systematically require students to establish 
what they know (K) about a topic, to set what they want to know (W), and to monitor what they 
have learned (L). The K-W-L approach is closely aligned with the metacognitive dimension of 
the interactive-constructive model’s accessing prior knowledge, setting purpose, and monitoring 
progress. Classroom application of the K-W-L technique might involve brainstorming to list 
what is already known (K) about the topic and to elicit questions that reflect what students want 
(W) to know about the topic. Teachers must be careful to suspend judgment of student ideas 
during the initial discussions, to provide questions pertinent to the reading, and to elicit student- 
generated questions that maximize the students' ownership of the process. After reading the text, 
both scientific or issues-related discussions should help students engage prior knowledge, 
address contradictions, and construct new understandings, composed of either revised or new 
conceptions. These results are entered in the third column of the K-W-L chart. Comparing the 
entries in all three columns allows both the teacher and the students to clearly monitor learning 
(L). 

Using Context 

Science text is composed of unique word labels for conceptual clusters of scientific 
experiences that are uncommon in non-science text, and these word meanings reflect specific 
situational context Effective readers frequently make decisions about word meanings based on 

.s' 

contextual clues provided within the word, sentence, and passage surrounding the target word. 
The use of prefixes, suffixes, and root-words; the use of metaphors and analogies; the use of 
specific signal words and logical connectives; and the use of general text meaning are component 
skills involved in the defining from context strategy. 

Identifying Main Ideas 

Students who receive explicit instruction on identifying main ideas demonstrate improved 
comprehension (Dole, Duffy, Roehler & Pearson 1991). Paris (1987) utilized a "detective" 




52 



metaphor (a reasonable metaphor for a scientist) in which the reader uses clues like pictures, 
topic, and title to find the main idea. He pointed out that many readers mistakenly believe the 
main idea is always described in the first or last sentence of the paragraph; unfortunately, science 
paragraphs do not always contain traditional topic sentences. Effective science readers must use 
a variety of relevant clues to identify main ideas or to even generate their own when none is 
given. The following lesson plan illustrates how elementary students might be taught about main 
ideas in the science classroom (Figure 1). Title, subheadings, bold-print, margin notes, pictures, 
in-text questions, topical context, and other print and layout features can be used as clues to 
imply main ideas. The actual clue used may vary from text to text. 

Summarization 

Ineffective readers tend not to differentiate amongst information and often “tell all” when asked 
to summarize. This weakness may be apparent in these students' class notes and highlighted textbooks; 
notes resemble verbatim minutes and textbook pages look like fields of dandelions. Explicit instruction 
on selecting important information, deleting that which is less important, trivial or redundant, and 
synthesizing the retained information into an integrated, coherent, and accurate representation improves 
comprehension (Dole, et al, 1991). 

With slight modifications of Paris’ (1987) "western round-up" metaphor, readers’ attention can 
be refocussed from the 5 W's for current events to main ideas, applications, evidence and exceptions for 
generating science text summaries. Other metaphors can be developed to capture regional differences 
and student’s interests, such as seine fishing, etc. Macro-rules can be established to get students to 

s' 

identify important main ideas, to delete unnecessary details and identify critical evidence and 
examples/counter-examples, and to generate a concise paragraph or pattern of argumentation that retains 
the author’s intent. The following example demonstrates a practical application of explicit instruction 
utilizing a typical science textbook (Figure 2). 

Text Structures 

Expository text does not have a single developmental structure like the traditional narrative text's 
story grammar (setting, beginning, development, ending). Science texts frequently utilize five common

Explicit Instruction about Detecting the Main Ideas 



1. Understanding the Metaphor 

The teacher, wearing a deerstalker hat, tweed jacket with large magnifying glass, referring 
to a poster of labeled footprints (pictures, margin notes, titles/ headings, context, prior 
ideas, actions, in-text questions, outcomes) accompanied by two questions, discusses with 
the class how clues are used to infer “who done it?” and “what caused it?” A review of 
how to play Clue © (Parker Brothers) illustrates how they used evidence to eliminate 
possibilities and progressively arrive at the best option. Attention is then directed toward 
the metaphor on the poster and the two questions: 

1 . Did I ask myself questions? 

2. Did I use clues to find the main idea? 



2. Direct Explanation 

Students are asked to explain what is meant by main idea, how the main idea might differ 
from the topic, and why the main idea is so 
important Next, students can be asked if they ever 
have difficulty finding the main idea. If so, what 
clues did they use? The students’ attention is 
focused on the labeled footprints on the poster. 

3. Guided Practice 

The strategy is now applied to a specific passage 
from the students’ textbook. The students are asked 
to use information from their textbook to complete a 
footprint hand-out (reduced copy of a poster) 
directed at finding the main idea.

Direct Explanation 

Discussion of the poster compares a round-up with a summary. Direct questions reveal 
the fact that calves are rounded-up while yearlings 
and cows are not Attention is directed to the labeled 
calves, and additional labels are added to unlabelled 
calves in the corral. A rationale for each type of idea 
to be included in the summary is developed and added 
to the poster. 

Guided Practice 

The strategy is applied to a specific passage from the 
students’ textbook. The students are asked to read the 
text and complete a round-up hand-out on 
summarizing. 



Specific Feedback and Consolidation 
The teacher discusses the type of information and the 
synthesis process used in composing the summary. A 
think-aloud approach is used to make the thinking 
process evident to students. 

Independent Practice and Transfer of Ownership 
The teacher requires the students to complete a summary hand-out for the next four to 
six reading assignments. The actual summaries are entered in the learning journals as a 
three-sentence summary. The first sentence identifies the main idea. The second 
sentence provide supportive detail or evidence. The third sentence provide a relevant 
application of the main idea.

The teacher, dressed in jeans, work shirt, boots and hard hat, 
carrying a roll of blueprints, addresses the poster of a bridge 
entitled function and structure. The students are oslcaH to 
identify examples of the function-structure relationship in the 
natural environment and the people-built environmentThe 
discussion explores how the construction worker uses function- 
structure relationships. The teacher then directs their attention 
to the function-structure of written materials — stories, news 
articles, etc. 

2. Direct Explanation 

The teacher introduces the use of function-structure relationship 
in scientific writing. The scientific journal 
format — purpose, problem, hypothesis, material, procedure, data, analysis, and conclusion — is riiseng«»d The 
teacher points out that this standard reporting format does not accurately reflect how scientists solve problems 
but it does provide a consistent format for journal readers. The teacher introduces the five common functions 
and structures used in scientific writing: 

a. Reporting observations and measurements— description. 

b. Reporting characteristics— collection. 

c. Reporting likes/dislikes of two or more ideas — compare/ 
contrast. 

d. Reporting cause-effect relationships — causation. 

e. Reporting problem-solving — problem-solution.

structure are projected and discussed. The benefits of 
using these graphic displays for oiganizing information

The cause/effect frame is applied to specific text from the students’ 
textbook. The students are asked to read the passage and complete the 
template. 



4. Specific Feedback and Consolidation 
The teacher discusses the completed template and where information was 
found. The general characteristics of cause/effect text are described: two or 
more paragraphs sequenced to describe the effect and factors related to the 
result in a causal relationship. The teacher uses a think-aloud approach to clarify the process for students. 

5. Independent Practice and Transfer of Ownership 

The cause/effect template is used when text passages are encountered in the science textbook until stu den ts are 
sufficiently confident without it The cause/effect template is also used as a basis for writing cause/efect 
passages from data collected during experiments. 

6. Application 

This text structure and template are used in writing and reading in social studies and in science articles or 
science tradebooks.

structures: description, collection, comp are/contrast, causation, and problem-solution. Each structure 
has its own predictable logic and organization. Unfortunately these text structures differ slightly from 
the writing genre discussed in writing to learn. Effective readers are able to identify these text structures 
and to use the knowledge of these structures to improve comprehension. Armbmster (1991) reported that 
instruction on these text structures improves reading comprehension. Armbruster, Anderson, and 
Ostertag (1989) described how to use specific templates to assist readers develop proficiency with 
various text structures and improve comprehension. The following example applies this approach to a 
cause/effect textual passage (Figure 3). 

Explicit Science Writing Instruction 

A problem faced by teachers in writing-to-leam science activities is students copying 
undigested chunks of material that are not understood nor, consequently, remembered. The 
reason that students copy from their resource books is threefold: (1) the resource material is 
already in required form; (2) students are reading text written by experts and writing to an 
informed audience; and (3) the writing is not focused on authentic questions requiring synthesis 
of ideas into unifying concepts (Anthony, Johnson & Yore, 1996). 

Writing a science ‘report’ usually means an informative, factual expository report. The 
research information for the science report is normally obtained from one or more resources, 
most frequently books. The resource books consulted by the students are already framed as 
informative, factual expositions and a single source contains far more information on the topic 
than needed or expected. Thus students are faced with a transportation and edit-to-length 
problem rather and a transformation, interpretative, and synthesis problem. 

The problem is compounded by the fact that both the author of the text and the audience 
(the teacher) knows more about the topic than the student writers. Thus, students read and write 
beyond their level of expertise. Novice writers are called upon (a) to read in an area about which 
they have little concrete experience and know little, (b) to develop expertise, and (c) to write in a 
form that is used to “inform” someone who may well know more about the topic.

Report writing assignments are frequently topic centered and fact focussed. The teacher 
decides mi a broad topic to be addressed, identifies a number of components within the topic, and 
assigns one component to each student or small group. The teacher may well take the students 
through a K-W-L sequence but the questions generated are frequently factual rather than 
strategic. Such low-level questions may be answered with specifics (knowledge telling), 
therefore the students arrive at the resource material lacking a strategic question that requires 
them to analyze, synthesize or verify the isolated text-explicit information (knowledge 
transforming). 

One simple way to discourage copying is to separate resources and notebooks and to 
utilize a variety of resources — concrete experiments, videos, internet, books, pictures, experts, 
etc. Designating an area of the classroom as the resource centre where a variety of resources are 
displayed and another area for writing limits the copying problem (Anthony, Johnson & Yore, 
1996). The separation rule says: At your desk you may have either a resource book or. your 
notebook but you may not have both. There is no limit on the times resources and notebooks may 
be exchanged. This system has been used successfully with very young students. One of the first 
strategies employed by students is “remember one word at a time,” but leg fatigue requires them 
to move on to the “read and understand the ideas” strategy. 

The “beyond the level of expertise” problem can be partially solved by having the 
novices collaboratively research different sources and write to inform their peers. Collaboration 
in the early information selecting and processing stages encourages novices to share ideas and 

*• ■ s" 

negotiate meaning with others of equal backgrounds. This procedure becomes exciting when the 
group encounters discrepant information from different sources that requires them to determine 
the most valid information or representation. Collaboration helps the group build expertise 
together. A sharing session in which each group presents their material to the rest of the class 
provides an authentic audience. An alternative maneuver is to have older children write for 
younger children. Buddy systems, frequently used to enhance reading, can be modified to 
provide an authentic audience for young science writers.

The “lack of strategic focus” problem can be solved by the use of radiant questions 
(Anthony, Johnson & Yore, 1996). A radiant question is one that elicits different but connected 
answers depending on where one looks for an answer. The adoption of a radiant question makes 
an enormous psychological difference when the students arrive at their resource books. 
Resources will present ample material that pertains to their question, but no single resource 
addresses the total question. The novices must read and write selectively. The radiant question 
requires the students to be selective, inferential, and critical to find appropriate information and 
to address discrepant information. Such text-implicit questions require the students to infer, 
access other information, compare-contrast, analyze, and generalize — the fundamental cognitive 
processes of science. 

The Information Retrieval Matrix 

Writing an informational report is neither a miraculous nor mysterious task. Rather it is 
simply a matter of making explicit those features of thought and language that are the 
instructional goals of the assigned task. This example describes the process of instructing a class 
in the task of writing an informational report about population traits and genetics. The explicit 
instruction procedure is focused on writing to learn by establishing an information retrieval 
matrix to support the interpretation of information, explicitly modeling the conventions of 
writing in science, guided practice of the approach, and independent application of the procedure 
to generate a descriptive, instructive, explanative, or argumentative report. 

A writing-to -learn science experience designed to introduce different genre can be 
illustrated by using an information retrieval matrix (columns for questions and rows for 
information sources) to establish strategic questions and collect information about population 
variation in traits, reproduction, heredity, chromosomes, genes, dominant traits, recessive traits, 
and patterns of inheritance. A K-W-L chart is used to organize the knowledge and questions 
about large posters illustrating life cycles and new generations of people, cats, dogs, and roses. 
Questions naturally arise as the variation in observable traits increase within a group or whether 
the grouping represents a “biological family,” what causes the variation, and why some 




59 



groupings have very small variations. These types of questions will provide the central 
foundation for the radiant questions used to set the writing assignments. 

After the “K” and “W” are completed, the first concrete inquiry should involve collecting 
data about the students’ observable traits (eye color, hair color, handedness, tongue rolling, 
widow’s peak, detached earlobes, relative length of the pointer and ring fingers, etc.). These data 
can be graphed for the class to determine most common traits and population variations. The 
graph can be used to write and illustrate descriptions of the most common or least common 
student in the class. A “child find” poster could be used as a model for writing a description. 

Next, the individual students’ traits can be color-coded onto a paper strip divided into a 
specific number of rows equal to the traits observed representing the genes in a chromosome. 

The paper strip can be cut longitudinally. One-half of the chromosome can be traded with 
someone. Additional trades can be made, but half of the student’s original chromosomes must be 
retained. The two halves of the paper chromosomes are taped together to represent the gene pairs 
of a complete chromosome. The resulting chromosome is then interpreted. Matched pairs of 
genes clearly result in predictable traits, but unmatched pairs of genes require further exploration. 
Appropriate text, video, internet, and experts should be consulted to establish dominant and 
recessive traits and patterns of inheritance. 

After the exploration students are randomly assigned a number 1, 2, 3, or 4. The assigned 
numbers correspond to a specific writing task. 

1 . Describe your offspring represented by the paper chromosome. 

2. Tell someone how to determine the traits of the offspring represented by the 

3. Explain why unmatched pairs of genes on the paper chromosome could increase variation 
in the next generation. 

4. Argue why eye, hair and skin colors of the world’s population will likely get darker as 
people mix. 

Small groups can be formed out of students assigned the same radiant question (1 ’s, 2’s, 3’s or 
4’s). The groups form “expert” groups like a “jig-saw” approach to research, discuss, and write. 




60 




Collaboration is encouraged, but individual written assignments are expected. The completed 
writing tasks are shared with peers from the other expert groups and with peers from the other 
radiant question groups. Whole group discussion should consolidate the scientific understanding 
and clarify the structural characteristics of each written form used to describe, instruct, explain, 
and argue. 

Promising Applications 

Simply increasing the number of hands-on activities in science is not the solution to the 
science literacy issue. We must selectively infuse other tasks into our science instruction that 
ensures students’ minds are on during these hands-on experiences and that promotes the 
strategies required of life-long learners. Tasks that have significant and discemibly positive 
effects are reading-to-leam strategies (Holden, 1996; Spence, 1994) and writing-to-leam science 
using appropriate genre (Fellow, 1994; Key, 1994; Rivard, 1996). These tasks encourage 
students to engage prior knowledge structures, access print-base information systems, construct 
new ideas, reorganize knowledge structures, integrate new and old knowledge, seek real world 
applications, and persuade others to take action. We believe that reading-to-leam strategies and 
writing-to-leam strategies have the benefits of improved conceptual understanding and memory 
and the benefit of improved communication of these informed perspectives — science literacy. 

If conceptual change and comprehension are prime objectives of science instruction and 
if scientific literacy involves a dimension of intellectual liberation, active citizenship, and life- 
long learning, then explicit instruction in science reading and writing strategies must be a part of 
the overall science program. Hynd, Qian, Ridgeway and Pickle (1991) pointed out that both 
hands-on inquiry and print-based information require supportive scaffolding to ensure conceptual 
change. Strategic science reading and writing instruction must keep improved science literacy as 
its central focus and it should engage prior conceptions, resolve contradictions, facilitate 
restructuring of understanding, and illustrate real-life applications. Furthermore, strategies 
instruction should provide students with metacognitive knowledge about using these strategies 
(what are they? HOW are they used? WHEN should they be used? WHY use them?) as well as 




61 



73 



executive control dealing with strategic planning, selection, self-monitoring, and regulating 
effort. 

We have found that reading and writing strategy instruction are inter-related, are cross- 
disciplinary, and are receiving greater attention in the professional journals. The examples 
included in this paper clearly illustrate the potential of writing to read and reading to write. 
Analysis of social studies textual materials and mathematical textual materials demonstrates 
significant similarities among science, social studies, and mathematics text and dissimilarities 
between any of these and narrative text. The annotated bibliography of recent articles from 
science education and language education journals illustrates the type of science reading and 
science writing ideas being promoted (Appendix A). Inclusion of the entries into the annotated 
bibliography does not indicate unreserved endorsement of each idea since many of these 
professional articles do not provide adequate research evidence and clear theoretical warrants for 
their claims. These articles are reasonable resources to use with pre-service and inservice 
elementary teachers. 

The genre that have specific applications in science (description, explanation, instruction, 
argumentation) are flexible, and the writer must control the specific form to address the function 
or purpose. If you use templates to introduce these genre, you must explicitly develop the idea 
that variation in form to address function is appropriate. Armbruster, Anderson, and Ostertag 
(1989) provide four templates for problem-solution, compare-contrast, sequence, and cause- 
effect that could be slightly modified to match the genre theory and be used to improve reading 
comprehension and expository writing. 

No lengthy piece of text uses a single genre. Analysis of effective writing illustrates 
micro-structures embedded within the macro-structure. In argumentation a writer might start with 
a descriptive passage to engage the reader, later the writer uses an explanation passage to 
illustrate a critical cause-effect relationship, and in closing the writer may use an instruction 
passage much the way a judge clarifies the issues, critical evidence, and the charge.

Reflections on recent research indicate that greatest effects of reading and writing to learn 
occur when the strategies are implemented across the curriculum and not restricted to a single 
discipline. Spence (1994) found numerous opportunities to apply the expository reading 
strategies discussed in this paper in social studies, mathematics, and language arts. We believe 
that a similar impact will be found for science writing strategies as the research foundation 
increases. Integration of science and language arts have proven time-efficiencies and improves 
both science and reading achievement and attitudes (Romance & Vitale, 1992).

Breger, D.C. (1995). The inquiry paper. Science Scope . JjL(ll). 27-32. 

Breger discusses using inquiry papers, short weekly papers based on independent readings, to 
help students understand what they have read. In writing these papers, students learn to organize 
and respond to scientific text as well as learning skills that promote life-long learning. Breger 
explains that modeling the process for the students is necessary, creating first a reading log, 
leading to an inquiry paper. A scoring rubric is provided for the assessment of the inquiry 
papers. As well, a Ust of sources on which students can base their papers is included. 

Casteel, CP., & Isom, B.A. (1994). Reciprocal processes in science and literacy learning. 

The Readi ng Teacher . 4Z_(7). 538-544. 

Casteel and Isom examine the parallel processes at work between literacy and science. They 
maintain that many of the process skills inherent in literacy are also an integral part of science 
and that these similarities can be used to help students in their learning. The authors also point 
out the value of using literature in the science program to make the unfamiliar more familiar. As 
well, Casteel and Isom advocate having students write and reflect about their experiences in 
science in order to foster further learning and understanding. 

Center for Applied Linguistics. (1993). Integrating math and scie nce with language

This document describes a program established by the Center for Applied Linguistics to improve 
math and science education for language minority students. To do this, two in-service training 
sessions were initiated for a number of classroom teachers. The goals of the in-services were to 
introduce teachers to the communicative approach to math and science, to develop instructional 
materials which aid in the integration of these subjects, to develop appropriate instructional and 
assessment practices, and to train teachers to train others in these methods. According to this 
report, the program was successful in attaining these goals. 

Charron, E. & De Onis, A. (1993). More complementary than contrary. Science 
Activities. 20.(1). 13-17. 

Charron and De Onis suggested that the gap between teachers who teach a "read the chapter and 
answer the questions" science lesson, and those who provide hands-on experiences is narrowing. 
A re-examination of the role of reading in science, and the need to include real-life experiences 
are two reasons for this changing view. Teachers are realizing that children need to create their 
own ideas about new concepts through self-exploration. An integrated teaching approach has 
also given teachers more time to facilitate this type of learning. Charron and De Onis believed 
that reading cannot take the place of doing science, but that the use of multiple information 
sources enhances learning. Charron and De Onis discussed how two teachers combine their 
interests to develop collaboratively a four step program that includes brainstorming sessions, 
activities, and reading. Both teachers believed that science should be taught using an equal 
combination of reading and doing and not used in isolation. 



Drake, S.M., Hemphill, B. & Chappel, R. (1996) A novel approach. The 

This article describes how a grade nine class connected the novel Ring Rise, Ring Set to science. 
The novel had a heavy science content which the teacher used to pique students curiosity. The 
question asked was: were the scientific concepts encountered in the novel just science fiction or 
sound scientific thinking? This central issue served as a springboard for inquiry. The students 
went through several different scientific experiments to explore science and science-like ideas. 
The authors claim that the scientific content resembled a traditional ninth-grade program but in 
this approach the content was set in a more relevant context and therefore sparked the students' 
curiosity. 

Eggerton, S. (1996). Balancing science and sentiment: The portrayal of nature and the 
environment in children's literature. Science and Children . 33 (6). 20-23. 

Eggerton examines the on-going controversy of scientific accuracy versus sentiment in children's 
literature. There are those who argue that imagination and real world overlapping create for 
children curiosity and interest. However, others argue that this overlap leads to the development 
of misconceptions in children's thinking. Eggerton explains that critical assessments must be 
made when choosing books on nature and the environment Furthermore, it is essential that real 
life connections are made when using literature. 

Farris, P.J. & Fuhler, CJ. (1994). Developing social studies concepts through picture books. 
The Reading Teacher . 4Z_( 5). 380-387. 

In their article, Farris and Fuhler advocate the use of picture books in the classroom to teach 
concepts to students. They explain that picture books add detailed information which is lacking 
in many traditional textbooks. Picture books also lend themselves to the exploration of sensitive 
or controversial issues. Furthermore, picture books provoke curiosity and questions from 
students. Picture books can be used to make the abstract more real to students. The authors 
provide more in depth analysis of how picture books can be used in each of the following areas: 
anthropology, geography, history, and sociology.

Huber and Waker suggest that students must read about science in order to gain more 
information in addition to doing science. They explain that this provides the opportunity to teach 
students about science as well as improve their science jeading skills. They provide a list of 
suggestions that can help science teachers support their students' growth in science knowledge 
and as readers. The list consists of the dos and don'ts involved when teaching science reading 
skills that promote a positive self-concept, attitude toward science reading and strategic approach 
to science reading. 

Mayer, D.A. (1995). How can we best use children’s literature in teaching science concepts? 
Science and Children . 32 (6). 16-19. 

Mayer examines the use of children's literature in science programs. Using a variety of literature 
which is used in teaching science, the author set out to determine what students learn from the 
use of fiction (a checklist was developed to determine the suitability of the book). In the study, 
Mayer discovered that fiction may interfere with the acquisition of knowledge. It was further 
expressed that when choosing literature in the classroom, care should be taken to ensure accuracy 
of information in both the text and the illustrations to reduce possible misconception which may 
ensue.

This article examines the need for young children to develop proficiency with expository texts, 
even in the primary grades. Having completed a survey, Olson and Gee share commonly 
recommended practices of primary teachers for content reading and also suggest specific 
strategies which are accompanied with examples to illustrate them. These strategies include: 
semantic mapping, KWL (what I know, what I want to learn, what I have learned), concrete 
manipulatives, expository paragraph frames, group summarizing, and visual imagery.

Teacher . 41(8). 608-615. 

The authors explain a framework for planning content area: a planning pyramid. The pyramid 
allows for inclusionary instruction for children with a broad range of abilities. The three degrees 
of learning examined are: what all student should know, what most but not all students will 
learn, and what some students will learn. The five points of entry described are: student, 
teacher, instructional practices, topic, and context An example, using simple machines, is 
provided to illustrate the planning pyramid. 



Current Articles on Writing in Science 



Clidas, J. (1996). Personal plot journals. Science and Children. 22.(6), 22-25. 

In this article Clidas describes how she organized and implemented 3m by 3m environmental 
study areas for her fourth-grade class. She goes on to describe the journals her students kept 
while visiting their plots twice monthly. These journals supported her students' science inquiry 
and learning and documented change over time. The field journals encourage her students to 
write like scientists, which in turn encourage them to observe, and think like scientists. 

Ediger, M. (1994/1995). Writing in the science curriculum. Catalyst . 22.(2). 36-41. 

Ediger strongly advocates the use of writing in the science curriculum. He explains that clear 
communication of thoughts and ideas is imperative. As well, he demonstrates that writing does, 
in fact, aid students in learning and reflecting. Ediger recommends writing be used in the 
following forms: experience charts, outlining content, experiments, book reports, journals, 
diaries, and logs in order to provide optimal learning and understanding for students. 

Johnson, T, Hawe, M. & Burkimar, J. (1995/1996). Augmentation: Extending 
ideas in report writing. Prime Areas. 38 (31. 41-45. 

Johnson, Hawe and Bu rkimar advocate the augmentation of a core text as a way for students to 
write reports. To augment a core text the students take a normal text and surround it with factual 
and fictional information. The original text is referred to as the core text The additions represent 
the augmentation. They claim that by using augmentation, instead of copying, there is a 
significant increase in the quality of children's engagement and understanding of the source 
materials, and their written reports. These important cognitive activities happen because 
augmentation requires transformation of information and ideas encountered in the text 
Augmentation also gives the students experience in writing expository texts. Johnson and Hawe 
give clear example of students' augmented reports, and how they are done in a classroom setting.

Ogens, E.M. (1996). The write stuff. Science Scope. 20 (1). 15-17. 

Ogens examines the use of journal writing in science class in this article. She describes how she 
uses journals in her classroom which include: to close a unit through summary of ideas learned, 
setting goals, recording progress, and posing further questions. She also uses journal writing to 
determine the level of understanding of the concepts taught and to help her identify the areas that 
need more clarification. As well, Ogens advocates journals as an invaluable instrument for 
promoting student-teacher dialogue - conduit for learning. 

Reif, RJ. & Rauch, K. (1994). Science in their own words. Science and Children . 2L(4). 
31-33. 

Reif and Rauch outline the value of students creating their own science books. This activity 
allows students to design, to write, and to illustrate their own books, making science learning 
relevant to them. Students are able to share their books with their class and with other students 
in the school. It is also explained that this project is ideal as it can be adapted to the level at 
which the children are working. The authors suggest three formats the books may take: alphabet 
book, concept book, or science narrative. The further offer a variety of suggestions for 
illustration. 

Rillero, P., Zambo, R., Cleland, J., & Ryan, J. (1996). Write from the start: Writing to learn 
science. Science Scope . 12.(7). 30-32. 

In this article, the authors advocate using the first few minutes of class for an activity called 
"Write Now." Students are asked to respond to a "quasar question"-powerful, open-ended 
questions which foster reflection and understanding. The teacher can use the questions as a form 
of daily assessment as well, assessing conceptual knowledge and misconceptions. The class can 
share responses and a discussion may develop from the varying viewpoints. The authors have 
provided examples of quasar questions and a variety of classroom strategies for using them. 

Ryan, J., Rillero, P., Cleland, J., & Zambo, R. (1996). Writing to leam math and 
science. Teaching K-8. 27 (1). 78-81. 

The "Write Now" approach is a writing to leam math and science program [also see 
Science Scope, 19 (7)]. This is a warm-up approach which includes using an open-ended 
question posted in die front of the room upon the students arrival. The students answer the 
question by elaborating on what they learned in the previous days' lesson. This approach 
provides the teacher with a chance to see whether the students have understood the lesson from 
the previous day and to assess other prior knowledge related to the topic. The article further 
explains the types of science and math questions that work for this approach, and they claim that 
open-ended questions work the best. 

Scamati, J.T. & Weller, C.J. (1992). Write stuff. Science and Children . 30 (4). 28-29. 

Scamati and Weller advocate the integration of language arts into science. The authors suggest 
that narration, description, explanation, and persuasion are the four basic methods of writing. 
These should be a student's "main purpose in writing" rather than watching for errors, such as 
"misspellings, grammatical errors, and messy penmanship." Scamati and Weller believed that 
there is "no better subject in which to practice these skills than science." By reporting on 
science activities, and keeping observations, students are in a situation where a need for different 
writing form exists. "Integrating science and language arts is easy to do as long as you keep in 
mind the four purposes for writing and recognize the relationship between writing and science 
inquiry skills. "

Articles on Integrated Reading and Writing in Science 

Jaegar, M., Lauritzen, C. & Davenport, M.R. (1996). Integrating curriculum. The 
Reading Teacher. 50 (1). 64-66. 

The authors describe an integrated approach to the study of Hot Lake: a local hot springs site 
with old buildings and ponds. This mysterious environment with steamy waters, ghosts haunting 
the legendary spa provide a high motivation and interesting focus for experimentation. The 
students pursued the discipline of science, acted as engineers, and explored folklore and history 
in this study. The authors also explain the idea that teachers and students who have an 
understanding of the nature of these disciplines can further use this understanding as a prism for 
examining contexts, generating inquires, and determining explorations. The oral and print 
language arts are essential in the construction of understanding and in the sharing of ideas. 

Lozauskas, D. & Bareli, J. (1992). Reflective reading. The Science Teacher . 59 .(8). 42-45. 

Lozauskas and Bareli encourage the use of a "thinking journal" in the science classroom wherein 
students write their thoughts while they read science materials or perform science experiments. 

It is important for the teacher to model how to write in these journals using a "think aloud" 
technique. The authors give a list of "starters" for the journal entries. They further explain the 
usefulness of journals in the insight they can give regarding the students thought processes and as 
a means of communicating through a running dialogue.

The authors of this article examine the use of the Guided Reading Procedure (GRP) in writing 
summaries. Two groups of students participated: the control group was given a traditional 
science program while the experimental group practiced GRP through a process of gradual 
release. Through examination of products, including a pre and post test, it was determined that 
students may initially struggle with comprehension when first learning the GRP strategy; 
however, it is speculated that this lessens with familiarity. S ummar y writing improved- 
evaluators saw increased paraphrasing and decreased reproductions in the students' writing. 

Schroder, G. (1996) The elements of story writing: using picturebooks to learn 
about the elements of chemistry. Language Arts. 73. 412-418. 

In this article Schroder writes about how her grade six class wrote and illustrated picturebooks 
for younger children to help make abstract and difficult science concepts more understandable. 
Schroder talks about each step of her project which includes taking students through: research, 
modelling, developing a plan of action, drafting, final revision and editing, and sharing the 
finished product: publishing. Schroder claims picturebooks were the natural bridge that made the 
study of elements meaningful to sixth grade students.

VIEWS ABOUT AND ACTIONS TAKEN ON GLOBAL 
ATMOSPHERIC CHANGE ISSUES BY MIDDLE AND 
HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS OF SCIENCE PARTICIPATING 
IN AN STS TEACHER ENHANCEMENT INSTITUTE 1 

Peter A. Rubba, Penn State University 
Janies A. Rye, West Virginia University 

Role-models have long been significant in helping to advance the ideals of society and good 
citizenship. Modeling (i.e., setting the example) continues to be commonly acknowledged as an 
effective teaching strategy for citizenship behaviors. Not only are teachers commonly held up as 
role models of appropriate citizenship (E. Holland, 1994; S. Holland, 1991), and in addition 
serve as role-models for would-be teachers (Stiegelbauer, 1992), but also K-12 teachers frequently 
use modeling in teaching (Baker, 1994, McAloon, 1993; Norman, 1992; Pestel, 1993; Schluter, 
1995). 

The value of modeling as a teaching strategy notwithstanding, there have been but two 
published studies on modeling as a science instructional strategy in the past six years. In one, 
Norman (1992) compared the use of modeling and the learning cycle in teaching science process 
skills to sixth through ninth grade students. In the other, Pestel (1994) examined the effectiveness 
of "teaching aloud problem solving" as opposed to modeling in college chemistry. Otherwise, 
modeling is absent from the recent science education literature. This is especially surprising given 
the rise in science education of STS (Yager, 1993) with its emphasis on citizenship action as the 
means toward the resolution of science- and technology-related societal issues (STS issues) 

(Rubba and Wiesenmayer, 1985, 1988). ^ 

Passe (1991) proposed that elementary teachers have great influence as role-models in the 
area of citizenship education, and so must not only talk-the-talk, but walk-the- walk:

Teachers are the most effective models for citizenship education.. ..For this reason, 
teachers must practice what they preach in the classroom. If teachers show active 
interest and involvement in citizenship matters,.. .students will likely do the same. 
(P-17) 



Purpose and Context 

In this paper, we examine the views held by four upper elementary teachers involved in 
STS instruction, through participation in a Leadership Institute in STS Education, on teachers 
serving as models of responsible citizenship action. The Leadership Institute in STS Education 
was a four-year collaborative teacher enhancement project of Penn State University and West 
Virginia University with upper elementary/middle/junior high school science teachers in the areas 
surrounding these two institutions, which are vastly rural. The major goals of the Institute was to 
develop teacher-leaders at the middle education levels in STS education. The Institute was funded 
by a Teacher Enhancement Grant from the National Science Foundation. 

Through the Leadership Institute, two dozen upper elementary/middle/junior high school 
science teachers from rural central Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia participated in 
professional development activities designed to develop teacher-leaders in the area of STS 
education. Activities were based on a STS research foundation connected to the long 
acknowledged scientific literacy goal of K-12 science education. The development and 
implementation of a STS issue investigation and action curriculum (Rubba & Wiesenmayer, 1988, 
1991, 1993) on global warming (hereafter referred to as the STS Unit) served as a focal point for 
the teacher development activities. 

The STS Unit went through multiple editions, each field tested by Institute participants and 
revised using field test data. Later editions produced during years three and four were expanded to 
deal with three related STS issues that fall under the global atmospheric change umbrella: enhanced 
greenhouse effect or global warming, as well as ozone depletion and ozone pollution. 



Concurrent with their work in developing the STS Unit, the teachers were involved in 
science content up-dates (e.g., the science, technology and societal aspects of global atmospheric 
change), pedagogical renewal (e.g., authentic assessment, cooperative learning, conceptual change 
teaching), use of the INTERNET for Institute and other communications, conducting inservice 
workshops on STS education, mentoring other teachers as they implemented the STS Unit, 
presentations at state and national professional conferences, and co-authoring articles emanating 
from the Institute (Ditty, Jarosick, Milam, Rubba, Rye, Wiesenmayer, & Yorks, 1993; McLaren, 
Yorks, Yukish, Ditty, Rubba, & Wiesenmayer, 1994). Details on the Institute are available 
elsewhere (Rubba, Wiesenmayer, Rye & Ditty, 1996). The effectiveness of the teacher-developed 
STS curricula in changing students' conceptions on global atmospheric change issues and the 
teachers' experiences in using STS curriculum development as a vehicle for teacher enhancement 
and improving practice in middle level school science were examined over the course of the 
Institute (Dorough, Rubba & Rye, 1995; Morphew, 1994; Rye, 1995; Rye, Rubba, & 
Wiesenmayer, 1994, in press). 

Along with the Institute activities noted above, the participants submitting electronic 
responsive journals on a regular basis and participated in annual interviews. The journal questions 
focused on science teaching and the integration of STS into science instruction. The interviews 
mainly focused on issues around implementation of the STS Unit, but also dealt with science 
teaching and the integration of STS into science instruction within that context. 

The desirability of teachers serving as models of citizenship action on a STS issue was not 
explicitly dealt with in the Institute. However, the STS goal structure that served as an organizer 
for the Institute and the STS Unit, emphasizes that every citizen has the right, if not the obligation, 
to help resolve STS issues (Rubba & Wiesenmayer, 1988, 1993). Accordingly, all editions of the 
STS Unit developed by the teachers had a capstone set of lessons on the development of 
citizenship actions skills in which students actually took action on global warming. The final 
edition of the STS Unit, which is entitled Global atmospheric change: Enhanced greenhouse effect, 
ozone layer depletion and ground level ozone pollution (Rubba, Wiesenmayer, Rye, McLaren, 
Sillman, Yorks, Yukish, Ditty, Morphew, Bradford, Dorough, & Borza, 1995), includes these

action lessons as well as accounts of actions actually taken by students of the Institute participants 
in an appendix. (For a copy of this unit, please see URL http://www.ed.psu.edu/dept/ci/sts/gac- 
main.html.) 



Procedures 

Subjects 

The subjects for this report included four upper elementary teachers (fifth and sixth grades) 
from central Pennsylvania who fully participated in the Institute over the first two years while the 
STS unit primarily focused on global warming. These four teachers are referred to herein as Edie, 
Jan, Helen, and Chuck. 

Edie had been an elementary teacher for 12 years upon joining the Institute. She held a 
bachelors and master's degree in elementary education, and had completed additional graduate 
credits in education, including a summer workshop on teaching science by inquiry. Over the 
period of the Institute Edie was teaching in a partially departmentalized sixth grade wherein she had 
responsibility for teaching science to three sixth grade sections. 

Jan had been an elementary teacher for 5 years. She held a bachelors degree in elementary 
education and had been working to complete the 24 credits of graduate coursework required in 
Pennsylvania in order to be permanently certified. Over the period of the Institute, Jan was 
teaching in a partially departmentalized sixth grade and so was responsible for the science 
instruction to three sixth grade class sections. 

Helen had been an elementary teacher for 15 years.'' She held a bachelors and master’s 
degrees in elementary education, plus had completed additional graduate courses in education over 
the past eight years. While in the Institute, Helen was teaching in a partially departmentalized fifth 
grade and so was responsible for the science instruction to three fifth grade class sections. 

Chuck had been an elementary teacher for 17 years. He had a bachelors and master's 
degree in elementary education plus additional graduate credits in education, including multiple 
science education workshops. Over the period of the Institute, Chuck was teaching in a self- 
contained sixth grade, except that he taught science for both sixth grade sections and the other sixth 




76 



grade teacher taught the social studies for both. Chuck also served as the substitute principal when 
the principal was at one of the other two elementary buildings to which he was assigned. 

All four teachers indicated an interest in global warming as a timely issue in early journal 
entries. They each had joined the Institute expecting to develop a greater understanding of global 
warming and to gain teaching resources on the topic, particularly the STS Unit that was to be 
developed, but also other resources, such as textual material, videos bulletin boards, and access to 
university faculty resources in science and education. Being connected to the INTERNET for e- 
mail was an additional incentive noted by each teacher. 

Data Sources and Analysis 

Approximately once a month responsive journal questions on science teaching and the 
integration of STS into science instruction were posed to the participants, during summer periods 
or residence at Penn State or West Virginia University in writing and during the academic year via 
e-mail. Responses were submitted directly to the project director. An example responsive journal 
question set is presented in Figure 1 , below. 



Please share your views on the following questions: 

• To what degree do you believe you are "environmentally responsible?" 

• What is it that you do or refrain from doing that is "environmentally responsible?" 

• As you reflect upon the way you live, are there other things that you are willing to do or 
refrain from doing that would make you more environmentally responsible?" 

• To what degree, if any, do you believe that science teachers should be "environmentally 
responsible." Please explain your response. 

Figure 1. An Example Responsive Journal Question Set 

At two points during the first and second academic years of the Institute, about two weeks 
after the STS Unit was implemented and typically during the second semester, staff members 
visited each participant’s school to interview the participant (as well as six to eight students). 
Standardized open-ended interview protocols (Patton, 1987) were used in conducting the teacher 
interviews. All teacher interviews were conducted in a private room (typically an office) and took 



O 

ERIC 



77 



approximately 35 minutes. These interviews were tape recorded, transcribed, and the transcripts 
verified and corrected as needed. An example excerpt from a teachers interview protocol is 
presented in Figure 2, below. 



Do you consider global warming a threat? 

What makes you say that? 

Is this the position on global warming you held when you started the Institute? 

Please explain. (If no change is noted, go to the next item) 

What caused the change? 

What would it take to now convince you that global warming is/is not (the opposite view) a 
threat? 

Why do you say that? 

Have you taken any actions in support of your position on global warming? 

Tell me about your decision to take/not take action. 

Do science teachers have any special responsibilities where taking action on STS issues is 
concerned? 

Please explain. 



Figure 2. An Example Teacher Interview Excerpt. 



The journal questions posed in year one were repeated in year two. Also, the interview 
protocols were similar both years. These procedures were approved by the institutional review 
boards for the protection of human subjects involved in research at each university. 

Understanding the degree to which the four teachers considered global warming a threat 
and the degree to which they took actions in support of their position on global warming, were 
considered requisite to understanding their views on teachers serving as models of responsible 
citizenship action. Relevant journal entries and interview responses from both years were reviewed 
to identify emergent patterns relative to these three areas. 



Findings and Discussion 

To what degree did the teachers consider global warming a threat? 

In a second year journal entry and interview, the teachers were specifically asked to rate 
global warming as a threat and provide justification for the rating. In both the journal entry and 



ERIC 



78 SO 



interview, all four teachers rated global warming as a serious threat - 8 or above on a 10 point 
scale — and added supporting justifications based upon the continuing worldwide production of 
greenhouse gases, i.e., carbon dioxide, CFCs, methane, water vapor. For example: 

Helen: 10 - The greenhouse gases that our lifestyle has put into the atmosphere greatly 

increase the greenhouse effect. 

Chuck: 8 - Carbon dioxide is going to have a direct negative result on temperature, 

which will change climate patterns and result in possible agricultural 
problems.... 

The development of the Third World Countries scares me the most. ..I think the 
rest of the world is going to want to catch up with our technology. China 
scares me more than anything.. ..[Ujnless we do something about the Third 
World,.. .how we move them into the twenty-first century, I don't think we 
have a chance. 

In response to the first year interview question, "Was this the position you held when you 
started the Institute?" Helen indicated that she had considered global warming a threat 10 months 
earlier — prior to joining the Institute: 

s' 

Helen: Yes, although I probably didn't think about it much. But yes. I'm sure, yes. 

Chuck admitted to initially confusing global warming with ozone depletion - a commonly held 
alternative conception is that the latter is a principle cause of the former (Boyes & Stanisstreet, 
1993; Dorough, Rubba, & Rye, 1995; Francis, Boyes, Qualter, & Stanisstreet, 1993; Koulaidis 
& Christidou, 1993; Rye, 1995; Rye, Rubba, & Wiesenmayer, in press). 




79 91 



Chuck: I thought global wanning was related to ozone depletion. I was ignorant of 

that, as most [people] are. 

However, prior to beginning the Institute 10 months earlier, none of the teachers listed global 
warming among the top dozen STS issues they believed faced humankind. 

When challenged in the second year interview with the question, "What would it take for 
me to convince you that global warming is not serious?" each of the teachers indicated being secure 
with his/her beliefs. For example: 

Jan: I don't think you could do that. I don't think you could honestly do that. 

Chuck: I don't think you could do that. I mean, the facts are out there. 

To what degree did the teachers take actions in support of their positions on global warming? 

Both in early first year journal entries and similar second year ones, all four teachers 
indicated that they were "trying to" be environmentally responsible. In support they noted example 
personal actions, but also admitted to some irresponsible actions. 

Edie: I would like to be more environmentally responsible and share my ideas with 

my students whenever it lends itself to whatever we're doing in class. My 
family recycles glass, plastic and aluminum (we drive 8 miles to a recycling 
center each month). We compost.. .and do not use pesticides and 
herbicides.. ..I believe that I am much more "environmentally responsible" now 
than I was five years ago. I also teach environmentally good practices to my 
family, friends, and students every chance I get! ! ! 

Our goal for 1992-93 is to build a more earth friendly home on land we have 
just purchased bordering an 1 1,000 acre conservancy. I also plan to TRY

AGAIN to interest our principal in a recycling program at school, along with 
taking action against a local polluter (next door to our school!). 

I try. I think that almost daily I consciously keep environmental concerns in my 
decision making. 

Sometimes I do choose to go ahead with actions that I know are not the correct 
choice environmentally, either because it is cheaper or more convenient, but I 
usually try to choose actions based on environmental concerns.. ..I keep the 
thermostat set low in the winter. No air conditioning. I carry cloth bags to the 
grocery store.. ..I used cloth diapers (when kids were little.)... .1 have 
personally planted thousands of trees [on our tree farm]. 

[On the other hand,] my showers are too long, we do not recycle as much as we 
should.. .(the centers I took my recyclables to all closed). Also, living in a rural 
area, I do drive more than I would like.... 

It is getting easier for me to be more responsible since our children are leaving 
home.. ..When he [oldest child] comes home to visit, it's the same old story, 
however.... 

I learned that using chlorine bleach isn't environmentally safe, so I'm trying to 
wean myself of that but I haven't found any product that equals bleach for 
whitening.... 

I do enjoy some creature comforts such as hot water, clean clothing (ironed), 
driving by myself.. ..This list doesn't seem too bad to me. 

I feel I'm a fairly environmentally responsible person. I try very hard to 
practice what I preach in school — recycle, use products that are 



81 



93 



environmentally friendly. I encourage friends, family and my students 
whenever I can to become more aware of our environmental responsibility.... A 
lot of what I do is consumer oriented that deals with what I buy and [do] not 
purchase. 

Many of the actions noted by the teachers were unique in the sense of being atypical for the 
time period (the early 1990s) and rural areas. For example, recycling was not mandatory in 
Pennsylvania at the time, most of the recycling centers were privately owned, and few were located - 
in rural areas. Still, none were linked by the teachers in their journal or interview responses 
specifically to global warming or to the other related global atmospheric change issues (i.e., ozone 
depletion in the upper atmosphere, ground level ozone pollution), and the actions they reported 
taking, for all practical purposes, did not change over the year between interviews and similar 
journal entries. Additionally, implied within the journal and interview responses of the teachers, 
was the understanding that many of the actions were ongoing and initiated prior to the beginning of 
the Institute in response to environmental concerns other than global warming. As noted above, 
Helen indicated that she had considered global warming a threat prior to joining the Institute. 

The following teacher statements from the late interview provide other supporting 
examples: 

Edie: I would hope that I have always been a bit conscious of my actions.. ..I have 

always tried to take the shopping bags, turn the water off, not make extra trips. 
All those things, ...I think goes back at least 20 years...to the first Earth Day. I 
remember being a teacher at the time and taking kids out. .to plant some 
trees.... 

Jan: [I have been doing] What I do normally. Maybe I do it a little more. Maybe 

I’m more conscious of what I do.

And Chuck, in comparing the actions he supposedly took on global warming to his activism on the 
Vietnam War, noted, "I'm [now] much more outspoken about it [--my actions]." 

What were the four teachers' views on teachers serving as models of responsible citizenship 
action? 

In an early journal entry, Edie noted a felt obligation — 

...to present to my students the environmental issues which are going to effect and change 
life on this planet (as we know it) in the years to come.. ..It's time (or past time) for all 
teachers to take a stand and do our part to educate and encourage a commitment from our 
students to "turn the tide" on the reckless devastation of our world.. ..I feel that it is of 
utmost importance...." 

Chuck expressed similar motives: 

Educating our students and making them aware of what is going on will allow them to 
make better decisions as they get older.. ..We must expose them to the current issues and 
problems for they must be included in the process to change present day beliefs and ideas 
into worthwhile solutions for our environment. 

Directly addressing the journal item, "To what degree, if any, do you believe that science 
teachers should be "environmentally responsible?" early in the Institute, Edie noted: 

We should "practice what we preach" — or we're being just as hypocritical as those in 
government who vow to work for chang e and then forget what they promised to do -- once 
in office. Our students need role models , not more actors and actresses. We have too 
many of those already. 




83 :95 



One year later, she expressed similar sentiments: 



As a teacher, I have a very unique opportunity to be a role model in all that I do to help the 
environment. I can share the many things that I believe will contribute to a cleaner, 
healthier environment with my students. I can also "practice what I preach" right in my 
classroom (recycling paper, not using any Styrofoam, always using biodegradables...etc.). 
I feel that's the way all teachers (not just science teachers) lives should be — representative 
of how they are being environmentally responsible. It is not a choice; It is an obligation 
for all of us!!!! 

Helen's, Jan's and Chuck's responses to the journal item were similarly consistent across 
the two years. For example, here are Helen's first and second year entries, respectively, to the 
same journal item: 

I think the best teaching of values [and] responsibility is done by example. We cannot 
reasonably tell students to alter behaviors if we will not Therefore, when I run into a little 
league team of my students in the grocery store, which I did, they all came up to me to see 
if I really had my canvas bags. (I did.) Had I not had them, I'm sure discussing behaviors 
would have been less effective. I really believe we must do those things to set an example. 

By example, we need to make students aware that tfreir actions are important I always 
carry cloth bags.... and I often run into my students, who always check... I have a 
calendar of 365 Ways to Save the Planet. We read those hints daily. I let students know 
which one of the things I am willing to do with how I live. 

When asked in the second year interview whether science teachers have any special 
personal responsibilities where STS issues are concerned, the teachers responded as follows: 




84 



Edie: Absolutely, I don't think any science teacher can avoid presenting the issues 

that are threatening the planet.... [And,] I think that if they teach it, they should 
live that way. 

Helen: Oh absolutely. I think we need to set examples. I think our best teaching is 

[by] example.. ..[T]hey pick up on those things we do. We can't tell them to do 
things and not do them ourselves. 

Jan: I agree 100% that science teachers have a special responsibility to be good 

models,.. .[and] I don't see [it] as my responsibility or part of my classroom in 
this building alone. 

Chuck: I don't know how you could teach science without teaching [it from] an STS 

approach..., [and] you have to set a good role model. 



Summary 

The teachers responses to journal and interview questions concerning the degree to which 
they considered global warming a threat, the degree they took actions in support of their positions 
on global warming, and their views on teachers serving as models of responsible citizenship action 
were consistent both across those inquiries and among the four teachers. The teachers considered 
themselves to be environmentally responsible as a result ofenvironmental actions they were taking. 
While they connected these actions to the resolution of global warming, the teachers, in fact, 
initiated the actions before joining the Institute, most likely as part of a general concern about the 
environment, and prior to recognizing global warming as a highly significant STS issue. The 
teachers' citizenship action behaviors did not appear to change in concert with the recognition of 
global warming's significance. One could infer that this relates back to the teachers believing they 
already were environmentally responsible where global warming was concerned.

The teachers' perspectives on teachers serving as models of responsible citizenship action 
were strongly consistent with the view expressed by Passe (1991), that elementary teachers have 
great influence as role-models in the area of citizenship education, and are, in fact, the most 
effective models for citizenship education. They appeared to operate under the belief that teachers 
must practice what they preach where responsible citizenship action is concerned, and if teachers 
show active interest and involvement in taking citizenship action, then students are more likely will 
do the same. 

The views and practices of the four teachers examined in this study on citizenship action 
notwithstanding, there has been little research on modeling as a science instructional strategy. This 
would appear to be a fruitful line of inquiry that would have broad implications for science 
curriculum, instruction and teacher education.

AN EXPLORATORY STUDY OF THE DISCIPLINARY KNOWLEDGE OF 
SCIENCE TEACHERS

Abstract 

The purpose of this study was to describe the disciplinary knowledge of a group of science 
teachers in terms of their knowledge of the structure, function and development of their 
disciplines, and their understanding of the nature of science. The study also aimed to relate that 
knowledge to the teachers’ level of education, years of teaching experience and the class level(s) 
that they teach. Twenty inservice science teachers were selected to respond to a modified version 
of the Views on Science-Technology-Society questionnaire to assess their understanding of the 
nature of science. The teachers then constructed concept maps and were interviewed. The 
concept maps were scored and the interviews analyzed to assess teachers’ knowledge of the 
structure, function and development of their disciplines. The teachers’ disciplinary knowledge 
was found to be lacking in all respects. Teachers held several naive views about the nature of 
science and did not demonstrate adequate knowledge and understanding of the structure, function 
and development of their disciplines. Moreover, the teachers’ disciplinary knowledge did not 
relate to their years of teaching experience, the class level(s) that they teach and their level of 
education. It was reasoned that teacher preparation programs are not helping teachers to 
articulate the disciplinary knowledge needed for teaching science.

Introduction 



Science educators and major science education organizations are increasingly advocating the 
preparation of scientifically literate students (e.g., AAAS, 1989; Lederman, 1992). In very 
general terms, a scientifically literate person should develop an understanding of the concepts, 
principles, theories and processes of science, and an awareness of the complex relationships 
between science, technology and society. More importantly, such a person should develop an 
understanding of the nature of science. 

There may be more than one level of scientific literacy. Anderson (1987) uses the ideas 
advanced by Bereiter and Scardamalia (1987) to conceptualize two levels of scientific literacy, 
low and high. Anderson argues that low literacy in science focuses on knowledge of facts about 
the world, while high literacy centers around the use of scientific facts in the description and 
explanation of natural phenomena and everyday life experiences. Bereiter and Scardamalia 
advance that low literacy has historically been characteristic of mass education and prepared 
citizens qualified for low level, manual jobs while high literacy has been characteristic of the 
education of the society’s elite and qualified them for the more intellectually demanding and 
creative jobs. However, in light of the increasing automation of manually-based occupations and 
an increasing demand on highly specialized, brain-intensive ^occupations, a high level of scientific 
literacy is becoming a necessity for all students. Bereiter and Scardamalia argue that high levels 
of literacy may not be achievable by the simplistic solution of modeling mass education after that 
of the elitist and suggest that an attainable form of high literacy should be made available to all 
students. 

Considering the above, Anderson (1987) defines good science teaching as that geared 
toward developing an attainable form of high scientific literacy and good science teachers as 

ERIC 




“those adequately prepared to help their students achieve an attainable form of high literacy” (p. 
4). Anderson argues that teachers who are supposed to teach for an attainable form of high 
scientific literacy, should themselves be highly literate in science. More importantly, those 
teachers should be capable of transforming their knowledge and understandings of science to a 
level that students can attain. Without such transformation, teachers’ knowledge and 
understandings would remain virtually tacit and not available for teaching. Teachers would not be 
able to help students develop the desired understandings of science. 

Shulman’s Model of Teaching 

The centrality of transformation to ‘good’ teaching was also emphasized by Shulman 
(1987). Shulman advances that good teaching requires a deep knowledge of the content to be 
taught interwoven with an adequate model of teaching. Shulman’s model of teaching is cyclical. 
The model has a set of actions which are comprehension, transformation, instruction, evaluation 
and reflection. 

Teaching begins by comprehension. Teachers should comprehend how the ideas within 
their discipline are inter-related and connected, what is to be taught and how to teach it, and the 
aims and purposes of teaching. Teachers should also be able to transform their understanding of 
the subject matter into forms that are attainable by the students and that are simultaneously 
“pedagogically powerful” (Shulman, 1987, p. 15). After comprehension and transformation 
comes instruction. Shulman notes that the methods of instruction used in the classroom are 
directly related to the teacher’s content knowledge, and are influenced by his/her personal 
understanding of the subject matter. Evaluation follows instruction. Such evaluation requires a 
firm grasp of the subject matter. The final step is reflection on all of the above activities. 

Shulman suggests that such reflection is not a disposition, nor is it a set of strategies. Content- 



specific analytical knowledge is needed to reflect on the teaching activities. This process ends by 
reaching a new comprehension. A new cycle of teaching then commences at a higher level of 
understanding. 

Shulman (1987) also identifies the professional knowledge base needed for ‘good’ teaching. 
He enumerates several dimensions of this knowledge base. Among these dimensions are content 
knowledge, general pedagogical knowledge, and pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). Of 
particular interest is content knowledge and PCK. Shulman defines content knowledge as 
knowledge of the substantive and syntactic structures of a discipline. Substantive knowledge 
refers to knowledge of the global structures or principles of conceptual organization of a 
discipline. It includes knowledge of facts, concepts, and principles within a content area and 
knowledge of the relationships between these. Syntactic knowledge, on the other hand, includes 
knowledge of the “historical and philosophical scholarship on the nature of knowledge” in a 
discipline (Shulman, 1987, p. 9). It refers to knowledge of the principles of inquiry and values 
inherent to the field, and of the methods with which new ideas are added and deficient ones are 
replaced by those who produce knowledge in that field. Applied to the sciences, syntactic 
knowledge corresponds to an understanding of the nature of science. On the other hand, PCK is 
presented as “the blending of content and pedagogy into anunderstanding of how particular 
topics, problems, or issues are organized, represented and adapted to the diverse interests and 
abilities of the learners, and presented for instruction” (Shulman, 1987, p. 8). Under PCK, 
Shulman includes “the most regularly taught topics in one’s subject area” and the alternative and 
useful ways of representing those topics to make them understandable to students. These 
alternative representations include “analogies, illustrations, examples, explanations, and 
demonstrations” (Shulman, 1986, p. 9). Also included under PCK is knowledge of students’ 



misconceptions about the topics most commonly taught and the “instructional conditions 
necessary to overcome and transform those initial conceptions” (Shulman, 1986, p. 10). 
Explication of Shulman’s Knowledge Base Specific to the Sciences 

Anderson (1987) notes that Shulman (1987) provides answers regarding what prospective 
teachers need to know (the knowledge base) and how to use that knowledge (the teaching cycle). 
Anderson acknowledges Shulman’s “how” but provides an explication to the “what”. This 
explication, Anderson claims, would have more utility in guiding curricular design for teacher 
education programs in the sciences. 

Anderson (1987) presents a conceptual framework of what he considers as the nature of 
disciplinary scientific knowledge needed to help prospective teachers achieve high literacy, thus 
allowing them to transform their knowledge into forms attainable by the students without severely 
distorting that knowledge. He characterizes this disciplinary scientific knowledge as having three 
major components: structure, function and development. 

Teachers’ knowledge and understanding of the facts and concepts of science should be 
enriched with knowledge of the structure of the discipline. The structure refers to the 
relationships among scientific facts, concepts and procedures. It stands for the organizing 
principles about which facts and principles are interwoven in a dynamic fashion. Mastery of this 
knowledge allows teachers to integrate and “reorganize their knowledge and make it accessible to 
students” (Anderson, 1987, p. 10). This knowledge may serve as a precursor to understanding 
the empirical and holistic nature of science. 

The function relates to the social and personal activities that knowledge of science prepares 
the individual to do. It is with such knowledge that the teacher can relate science to the everyday 
life activities and experiences of students, thus making science relevant to them. It also implies 




awareness of the societal impact of science, thus allowing the teacher to deal with this valued 
aspect of science education. This knowledge relates to the public nature of science. 

F inall y the development of knowledge can be understood as the historical process through 
which knowledge assumed its current dynamic form. Otherwise it can be thought of as the way 
knowledge develops in individuals. This latter aspect is adequately reflected in knowledge about 
children’s alternative conceptions in science and the way these conceptions develop. Knowledge 
of the development of science allows the teacher to look for alternative forms of understanding of 
concepts that are too difficult or abstract to be within students’ reach. The teacher can thus 
present the concept at a level that matches the developmental level of the student. This aspect of 
Anderson’s (1987) characterization of scientific knowledge seems to be most intimately linked to 
the tentative, probabilistic, unique, replicable, humanistic and historic nature of science. 

So it can be seen that inherent to the knowledge of the structure, function and development 
of science as formulated by Anderson (1987) is an understanding of the nature of scientific 
knowledge. As such Shulman’s knowledge base specific to the sciences can now be defined as 
possessing deep knowledge and understanding of the structure, function and development of 
science, and a deep understanding of the nature of science. 

Anderson’s (1987) framework serves well to explicate Shulman’s (1987) knowledge base 
related to science teaching. His notion of the structure of the discipline and nature of science 
subsumes the deep understanding of the facts, principles and procedures of science, as well as of 
the processes involved in the production and validation of scientific knowledge. By adding the 
two dimensions of the function and development of science, Anderson also captures substantial 
parts of Shulman’s PCK. These two dimensions subsume knowledge of the history of the 
discipline, students’ alternative conceptions as well as knowledge of alternative representations of

94 



scientific concepts. Anderson’s formulation allows the teacher to match instruction to the 
developmental level of the learner and meet his/her individual needs. 

Adequacy of the Academic Preparation of Science Teachers 

Secondary science teacher preparation programs commonly include university studies at the 
respective science departments leading to a Bachelor in Science followed by a year of post 
graduate training at the department or school of education leading to a Teaching Diploma (Arzi, 
White, & Fensham, 1987) or teacher certification. Several science educators believe that the 
academic preparation of secondary science teachers, with its present form and emphases, does not 
adequately prepare science teachers to teach for conceptual understanding of science (e.g., 
Anderson, 1987; Arzi et al., 1987; Shulman, 1987; Stoddart, Connell, Stofilett, & Peck, 1993; 
Stofflett & Stoddart, 1994). 

The traditional, didactic pedagogy to which teacher candidates are exposed in university 
science courses serves only to equip them with minimal conceptual understanding of their science 
disciplines (Duschl 1983; Gallagher 1991; Pomeroy, 1993; Tighter ,1990). Teacher candidates 
leave college science courses with a very limited knowledge of the structure, function and 
development of their scientific disciplines and also show a limited understanding of the nature of 
science (Gess-Newsome & Lederman, 1993; Nordland & Devito, 1974; Stoddart et al., 1993; 
Stofflett & Stoddart, 1994). Over and above, many of them hold serious alternative conceptions 
about the science content they are supposed to teach. These alternative conceptions are often 
similar to those held by their younger students (Anderson, Sheldon, & Dubay, 1990; Bishop & 
Anderson, 1990; Stoddart et al., 1993). So typically teacher candidates enter teacher education 
programs with an established form of low literacy. Moreover, teacher candidates graduate from 
the science departments having developed a strongly held pedagogical conception of science 




95 1 07 



teaching. Stofflett and Stoddart (1994) notes that such a conception is typically that of teacher- 
centered lectures, demonstrations and textbook readings. 

Teacher education programs do not usually challenge the strongly held misconceptions in 
content and pedagogy that their prospective teachers bring along. Teacher educators focus on 
helping student-teachers learn how to teach, and not what to teach (Stoddart et al., 1993, Stofflett 
& Stoddart, 1994). This is achieved by exposing student-teachers to general pedagogies of 
teaching and classroom management techniques. No attempts are made to upgrade student- 
teachers’ knowledge of the content of their disciplines. And although some programs focus on 
developing student-teachers’ conceptions of the nature of science, they do little to help them 
develop the knowledge and understandings necessary to transform such conceptions into actual 
practices inside the classroom (Gallagher, 1991). Teacher education programs seem to do little to 
upgrade student-teachers’ knowledge of the structure, function and development of their 
discipline. It can thus be concluded that prospective science teachers leave teacher preparation 
programs with limited understanding of the valued aspects of what is supposed to be the 
disciplinary knowledge they need for teaching science. 

Anderson’s (1987) explication of Shulman’s (1987) knowledge base may serve as a sound 
theoretical basis for characterizing the extensive knowledge base needed for good science 
teaching. This may have important implications on the assumptions that guide curricular 
development and reform of science teachers preparation programs. Accessing and describing 
teachers’ disciplinary knowledge may serve as a first step toward that end. 

The purpose of the present study was to describe the disciplinary knowledge of a group of 
science teachers. This knowledge was characterized in terms of the teachers’ knowledge of the 
structure, function and development of their scientific disciplines, and their understanding of the

nature of science. This knowledge was also related to such variables as the teachers’ level of 
education, their years of teaching experience and the grade level(s) they teach. 



Method 



Participants 



Twenty female inservice science teachers were selected to participate in the study. All 
teachers were graduates of the American University of Beirut (AUB), Beirut, Lebanon. All of 
them were teachers at private schools where English is the language of instruction. Their ages 
ranged between 21 and 45 years (with a median age of 31 years). All teachers held Bachelors 
degrees. Three of the participating teachers majored in physics, six in chemistry and eight in 
biology. The remaining three teachers majored in medical lab technology, agriculture, and 
pharmacy respectively, but all three had biology as a minor field of study. Five teachers held a 
Master of Science degree: two in physiology, one in microbiology, one in physics and one in 
agriculture. Ten of the participating teachers also held a Teaching Diploma (T. D.) in Science 
Teaching awarded by the Department of Education at AUB. The teaching experience of the 
selected teachers ranged between 1 and 19 years (with a median of 4 years). They taught 
intermediate and/or secondary grades (one teacher taught elementary grade levels). Of the 20 
teachers selected only 17 completed all phases of the study. Three teachers left abroad before the 
study was concluded. Teachers in the sample reflected the enrollment of students in the various 
science departments at AUB as well as the enrollment of student-teachers in science methods 
courses at the Department of Education of the same university during the past few years. 

This purposive sampling (Bogdan & Biklen, 1982) was used because it best served the 
purpose of this study. This sample was by no means intended to be representative of any larger 
population of science teachers.

Instruments and Procedures 



The study’s main feature was that of thick descriptions. Three different methods were used 
to generate data for the study. A modified version of the Views on Science-Technology-Society 
questionnaire (Aikenhead, Ryan, & Fleming, 1989) was used to assess teachers’ understanding of 
the nature of science. Concept mapping was employed to measure teachers’ knowledge of the 
structure of their scientific disciplines. Finally, clinical interviewing was used to assess teachers 
knowledge of the function and development of their disciplines. 

Views on Science-Technoloev-Societv (YOST S) Questionnaire 

VOSTS was developed by Aikenhead, Ryan, and Fleming (1989). The instrument allows 
respondents to express their own viewpoints on a wide range of topics related to science. The 
instrument is an inventory of 1 14 multiple-choice items. Each item consists of a statement with 
several related reasoned viewpoints or positions. The items address topics related to defining 
science and technology, the external and internal sociology of science, as well as the epistemology 
of science. VOSTS items also relate to a wide range of Science-Technology-Society (STS) 
issues. 

The version used in this study comprised 22 items that related to the nature of scientific 
knowledge. Since VOSTS is an inventory, selecting any number of items needed to investigate a 
certain science-related issue is appropriate (Aikenhead & Ryan, 1992). The items chosen 
specifically addressed the following components of the nature of science: the nature of 
observations, scientific models and classification schemes; the tentativeness of scientific 
knowledge; precision and uncertainty in scientific knowledge; logical reasoning in science; and the 
epistemological status of scientific knowledge. This epistemology relates to scientific 
assumptions, values in science, conceptual inventions in science (hypotheses, theories and laws), 



scientific method and consensus making in science. Also addressed is the issue of paradigms 
versus coherence across the various scientific disciplines. Moreover, although developed for 16 
and 17-year old students, “VOSTS items have been used successfully with university students and 
with teachers” (Aikenhead & Ryan, 1992, p. 489). Fleming (1988), and Zoller, Donn, Wild, and 
Beckett (1991) successfully used the VOSTS questionnaire to assess science teachers’ views and 
beliefs on STS related issues. 

As the instrument was developed in the Canadian context, a group of science education 
students at AUB read the instrument and evaluated its content and appropriateness for the 
Lebanese setting. The modified version of the instrument was also pilot-tested on a randomly 
selected sample of 10 students who earned a Bachelor of Science from AUB in July, 1994. The 
pilot test’s main aim was to assess university students’ understanding of the items and the 
wording of the viewpoints. The evaluators’ and respondents’ feedback was positive. A few 
minor changes were recommended. These changes amounted to replacing some unfamiliar terms 
in two statements and in a few viewpoints with more familiar synonyms. 

In addition, the selected VOSTS items were modified to become more flexible. On the 
original version of the instrument, each VOSTS item ends with the same three statements: I 
don’t understand”, “I don’t know enough about this subject to make a choice” and “None of 
these choices fits my basic view point”. In the version that was used in this study, the final choice 
appeared as: “None of these choices fits my basic view point. My basic viewpoint is:” and the 
respondent was provided with space to express any viewpoint he/she deemed more appropriate. 

All teachers were administered the modified version of VOSTS questionnaire. Teachers 
completed the questionnaire overnight in the privacy of their own homes. Most reported that it 
took them about one hour to respond to the 22 items selected.

Concept Mapping 

Concept mapping was used to assess teachers’ knowledge of the structure of the discipline. 
Concept mapping has been employed by researchers to assess structural knowledge at one point 
in time for purposes of comparing individual learners or groups of learners (e.g., Hoz et al., 1990, 
Markham et al., 1994) and to tap changes that occur in cognitive structures as a result of 
instruction and time (Markham et al., 1994; Novak, 1990). Markham et al. (1994), Wallace and 
Mintzes (1990), and Winitzky, Kauchak, and Kelly (1994) examined the concurrent validity of the 
concept map as a tool for assessing cognitive structures. The researchers concluded that there 
exists “a potentially strong relationship between the complexity of cognitive structures as revealed 
in concept maps and the extent of . . . meaningful knowledge possessed by the learner” (Wallace 
& Mintzes, 1990, p. 1045). As compared to other methods (e.g., paper and pencil tests, card sort 
tasks, etc.), the researchers found concept mapping to be the only technique to assess not only 
what the learners know but also how they come to organize their knowledge. Moreover, 
Anderson’s (1987) definition of the structure of the discipline, and the theoretical bases on which 
Novak and Gowin (1984) built concept mapping as well as the kind of information explicated in 
concept maps, converge to the same point. Both aim at assessing and explicating an individual’s 
depth of understanding of a set of concepts in a certain domain and of the relationships that link 
them together. This may serve as a possible theoretical background that may support the 
potential success of concept maps in tapping teachers’ structural knowledge. 

A structured concept mapping task was used in this study. Subjects first received training in 
concept mapping. In a one-hour session each subject was individually introduced to concept 
maps and key terms (concepts, propositions or relationships, cross-links, branches and hierarchy). 
Subjects were also introduced to the scoring criteria. This was followed by practice. Subjects 

ERIC 112 



100 



were provided with a list of general science concepts and given the opportunity to construct a 
concept map. The map was then discussed and evaluated. Since each teacher was trained 
individually and to insure consistency in training, an explicit script was followed by the 
researchers. 

After the training was concluded, each teacher and according to her disciplinary background 
was supplied with a list of 20 concepts relating to one of three topics. The topics selected were 
digestion; the chemistry of compounds, elements and atoms; and heat energy and temperature. 
The topics were presented to biology majors and minors, chemistry majors, and physics majors 
respectively. These topics were selected because they are taught both at the intermediate and 
secondary levels in the Lebanese curriculum with varying extents of depth and complexity. 

Science teachers are very likely to have taught one of these topics at one time in their careers. 
Moreover, these topics lend themselves to be related to the everyday life of students. In addition, 
students’ alternative conceptions relating to these topics are documented in the literature (for 
example, Driver, Squires, Rushworth, & Wood-Robinson, 1994). The 20 concepts relating to 
each topic were chosen by the researchers and disciplinary experts. The three concept lists used 
were: 

Biology: absorption of nutrients, bile from liver, chemical digestion, chewing, digestion,

temperature difference, and thermal equilibrium. 

Concepts in each list appeared in alphabetical order to insure that no hints whatsoever are 
given to the teachers as to any possible hierarchical relationship between the concepts. 

Participants were then asked to construct a concept map using the list of concepts provided and 
were explicitly instructed to construct maps reflecting their university level science knowledge on 
the topic concerned. The maps were expected to be as extensive and elaborate as possible. No 
time limits were set for constructing the concept map. However, teachers took between 45 and 
60 minutes to construct and review their maps. 

Clinical Interviews 

Once teachers’ knowledge of the structure of their disciplines was represented, the 
researchers proceeded to tap their knowledge of the function and development of science. This 
was achieved by using individual clinical interviews which were based on the concept maps 
generated by the teachers. 

Knowledge of the function of the discipline was assessed by asking the teachers to explicate 
their knowledge of everyday life applications relating to the specific topics addressed in the maps, 
and/or everyday life applications relating to specific concepts that the teachers have mapped. 
Teachers were asked to be exhaustive and were to list as many everyday life applications as 



ERIC 



114 



102 



possible. This helped to reveal the teachers’ knowledge of the relevance of the addressed science 
concepts to the everyday lives, interests and needs of their students. 

Tapping knowledge of the development of science was achieved by using two approaches. 
The first was based on the assumption that knowledge of the development of the discipline allows 
the teacher to match the science content to be presented to the developmental level of the student. 
Teachers should be able to tailor and present science concepts without de-contextualizing those 
concepts, or presenting students with isolated and distorted conceptions that need be memorized 
(Anderson, 1987). This was achieved during the interview by asking each teacher about the 
changes she would make in her concept map if she were to teach the same set of concepts to 
students in an intermediate grade level. The teacher also had to justify any changes she would 
make. As the original map constructed by each teacher was supposed to reflect her university 
level knowledge of the topic addressed, teachers were expected to modify the structure, the 
complexity of the interrelationships and the levels and number of hierarchies in their maps in order 
to match it to the grade level assigned. The grade level chosen was the second intermediate 
where students are typically 12-year old. In the second approach each teacher was asked to 
explicate her knowledge of any alternative conceptions (or misconceptions) that students of the 
second intermediate hold about the topic addressed in the concept map. Were the teachers to find 
characterizing the alternative conceptions of 12-year old students not feasible because they did 
not teach this particular grade level, they were alternatively asked to list the alternative 
conceptions of the students in any grade level(s) that they teach. Again teachers were asked to be 
exhaustive. 

The clinical interviews were semi-structured. In the first part of the interview, the 
researchers reviewed with the teacher the map that she had constructed. The objective was to 



clarify any ambiguities in the map and give the teacher a second chance to review the relationships 
that she had mapped between the given set of concepts. Next, a set of three basic questions 
guided the interview. These questions were: 

1 . The map you have constructed reflects your university level knowledge, and you can see 
that a concept map can be used to guide instruction. If you were to teach the same set of 
concepts to students of the second intermediate, i.e. 12-year old students, what would you 
change in this concept map? and why? 

2. It is believed that students come into the classroom having --out of their everyday life 
experiences, built some conceptions about the natural world around them including ideas 
related to the topic/concepts that we have been discussing. Do you know about any such 
ideas that 12-year old students (or students that you teach) bring with them into your 
classroom and that relate to the concepts at hand? 

3. Relating science to the everyday lives of the students is very important both to get them 
interested and to make studying science more meaningful for them. I would like you to list 
as many of the examples that you use to relate the topic/concepts at hand to the everyday 
life of your students as you can. 

However, digressions were very common and the researchers often re-worded the above 
questions and used many other questions to follow the teachers’ lines of thought or when deemed 
important. For example, one digression that was recurrent in interviews with biology teachers 
was asking them about proper diet and food groups (for example: what types of nutrients are 
found in “Labneh”? Labneh -a dairy product, is a traditional and very common Lebanese dish). 
This was necessary as most of the biology teachers found it relatively difficult to give everyday 
life examples related to digestion. When biology teachers were not able to relate digestion as a 



3

jL 



£ 



104 



process to the everyday lives of their students, other questions were used. Two examples of such 
questions were: 

1. Every time a 12-year old student eats a double burger, French fries and drinks a large 

cup of Pepsi for lunch, he/she almost always hears that this food is not healthy. What would 

you tell him/her? 

2. Children are often told that they should not drink water directly after having lunch. Is 

this really problematic? What would you tell your students? 

The above examples were by no means exhaustive but were intended to give examples of 
the digressions that occurred in the interviews. 

Data Analysis 

Data analysis was conducted by one of the researchers. An independent and blind analysis 
was then performed by the second researcher to corroborate any findings or conclusions. 

Analysis of the Responses to the YOSTS Items 

Teachers’ responses to the VOSTS items were categorized as informed or naive. Views 
that converge with the more recent conceptions of the nature of science advanced by such 
philosophers of science as Kuhn were characterized as informed. Alternatively, views were 
categorized as naive if they converged with those views advanced by logical positivists. Logical 
positivists suggest that science is directly related to reality, and that it strives to uncover absolute 
truths independent of the scientists’ personal, social and cultural characteristics. Moreover, they 
suggest that objectivity in science is only guaranteed by the scientists’ use of the inductive 
scientific method (Ryan & Aikenhead, 1992). 

Viewpoints on each item used in the study were categorized as reflecting informed or naive 
conceptions. The researchers carried out the categorization independently. Full agreement on 



classifying all viewpoints was the criterion to include an item for final analysis. Only one item 
relating to scientific theories was excluded from the analysis as agreement on categorizing some 
viewpoints was not reached. The same categorization was done for those ideas that were 
expressed by the science teachers when they decided that none of the provided viewpoints on a 
certain item expressed their own beliefs. Next, the percentages of informed and naive views for 
all the items were calculated for each teacher. 

Scoring the Concept Maps 

Three expert maps were constructed by reference to concept maps in disciplinary textbooks 
(e g., Hewitt, 1987; McLaren, Rotundo, & Gurley, 1991; Towle, 1993). The maps were 
reviewed by disciplinary experts. 

A modified version of a scoring scheme used by Hoz et al. (1990) was employed to score 
the maps. Four dimensions of the constructed maps were assessed. These were disciplinary 
validity, congruence, salience and central concepts. 

The nature of the links in a particular knowledge structure have three dimensions: the 
correctness of the links (validity), the extent to which the substantial links are actualized and the 
abundance of the valid links. Substantial links are mandatory links as depicted on the expert 
maps. In the present study all links on the expert maps were considered substantial. 

The validity of the links was assessed on a four level ordinal scale (0 to 3). The links were 
classified as valid (having levels 3 or 2), or invalid (having levels 1 or 0). Judgments were made 
by comparison to the expert maps. Scores were assigned as follows: valid (3 points) for a correct, 
precise and clearly stated link; moderately valid (2 points) for a correct, sensible but incomplete 
link; partially valid (1 point) for a general and indirect link lacking in certain aspects; or invalid (0 
points) for an incorrect link. It should be noted that a link that represented a negative instance — 



i.e. the lack of a relationship between two concepts, was considered not valid unless this 
relationship was substantial and was depicted on the expert maps. An example of such negative 
instances was that “water does not need chemical digestion”. The simple fact that a link between 
the two concepts (water and chemical digestion) is not mapped implies the lack of that 
relationship. The validity of the knowledge structure was computed as the percentage of the sum 
total of the validity scores on a concept map out of the maximal validity scores as derived from 
the expert map. 

To measure the extent to which the substantial links were actualized, congruence scores 
were used. Congruence was computed as the number of the valid, substantial links in a map 
divided by the number of all substantial links as derived from the expert map. 

Salience measures the abundance of valid links. Salience was computed as the number of 
valid links divided by the number of all links in a teacher’s map. 

In a knowledge structure there are central concepts. A central concept was defined as one 
having substantial, valid links with at least 15% --i.e. with at least three concepts, of the 20 
concepts in the concept map. The extent to which central concepts were actualized was 
calculated as the number of central concepts in a teacher’s map divided by the total number of 
central concepts as derived from the expert maps. 

An additional score was also produced for the map as a whole. The scoring scheme focused 
on the complexity of the knowledge base and the structure of the scientifically acceptable links 
depicted on the map (Wallace & Mintzes, 1990). Scoring focused on the number of relationships 
(one point for each valid proposition), hierarchy (five points for each valid level of the hierarchy), 
branchings (one point for each branch with valid links) and cross links (ten points for each valid 





107 



cross link) represented in the map. Then, the scores were compared to a score derived from the 
expert map. 

To insure the reliability of the scoring, the concept maps were first independently scored by 
the researchers. Then one physics, two chemistry and three biology concept maps were randomly 
selected from among the seventeen maps. These maps were blindly scored by three disciplinary 
experts according to the scoring criteria described above. The correlation (Pearson r) between 
the judges’ scores was 0.96 for the biology concept maps and 0.98 for the chemistry and physics 

concept maps. 

Clinical Interviews 

All interviews were audio-tape recorded and transcribed for analysis. The criterion used to 
evaluate the everyday life examples given by the science teachers was relevancy. The acceptable 
examples or everyday life applications were those related to the students’ lives and realm of 
experiences. The misconceptions identified by the teachers were considered valid if they were to 
converge with those documented in the literature. Otherwise the misconceptions suggested by the 
teacher were expected to converge with the definition of alternative conceptions presented by 
Fowler and BouJaoude (1987) who define an alternative conception as an “inaccurate 
understanding of a concept [or proposition], . . . wrong classification of concept examples, 
confusion between different concepts, improper hierarchical relationships, over- or under- 
generalizing of a concept [or proposition], or improper application of propositions (p. 4). The 
frequencies of valid everyday life examples and alternative conceptions provided by each teacher 



were tallied. 



Moreover, teachers’ responses to the researchers’ questions about changes they would 
make in their concept maps were these maps to be used to guide instruction with 12-year old 
students were categorized by discipline (biology, chemistry or physics) and reported. 

Finally, teachers were grouped according to the variables of interest: the teachers level of 
education, their years of teaching experience and the grade level(s) that they taught. Two groups 
were selected to reflect the level of education: T. D. and No T. D. Teachers in the *T. D. group’ 
held a Bachelor of Science and a Teaching Diploma. Those teachers in the ‘No T. D.’ group held 
a Bachelor or a Master of Science. Six groups were used to categorize teachers according to 
their teaching experience, while four groups were used to categorize them according to the class 
level(s) taught (elementary, intermediate, secondary, and intermediate and secondary grade 
levels). Next, the percentages of informed and naive teachers’ views on the nature of science, as 
well as their scores on the concept maps and the numbers of everyday life examples and 
alternative conceptions that they provided were averaged for the above groups. Relationships 
were then sought. 

Results 

The disciplinary knowledge of the science teachers was lacking in all respects. Teachers’ 
held many naive views about the nature of science and showed inadequate knowledge of the 
structure, function and development of their disciplines. These components of disciplinary 
knowledge did not relate to the teachers’ level of education, their years of teaching experience or 
the class level(s) they taught. 

The Nature of Science 

While all of the teachers expressed some views that are in line with the more recent 
conceptions of the nature of science, they all held many naive views. The percentages of informed 




1 



109 



..21 



views ranged between 38% and 67% while the percentages of naive views ranged between 33% 
and 62%. The average was 50% for informed views, 48% for naive views and 2% for ‘no 
position’. 

Averages of the percentages of informed and naive views for the teacher groups categorized 
according to the variables of interest are presented in Table 1 (see Appendix). No major 
differences were evident between the various groups. A summary of all participant teachers’ 
views on the nature of science is presented below. 

Almost all of the teachers (94%) believed that scientists follow a recipe --the so called 
scientific method, in their investigations. A sizable majority (88%) believed that sticking to the 
scientific method differentiates the competent from the incompetent scientist. The teachers thus 
overlooked the role of creativity and imagination in science. In fact, when the term “scientific 
method” appeared on the items that addressed the topic of “scientific approaches to 
investigation”, all the teachers expressed naive views. However, when responding to other items 
that addressed the same topic without explicitly stating the term “scientific method”, almost all the 
teachers (94%) adopted the more informed view that scientific activities are not completely 
logical and sequential. It seems that teachers did not give much thought into items where the 
term “scientific method” appeared. They seemed to have directly adopted the naive views 
propagated in school science textbooks about this issue. 

Moreover, many teachers (47%) did not show an adequate understanding of the humanistic 
nature of science. They thought that scientific models are copies of reality rather than human 
inventions. The majority of teachers (82%) did not appreciate the role of theories in guiding 
scientific investigations. Recognition of the existence of paradigms was replaced with a belief in 
the universality of science. Many teachers (71%) did not demonstrate an adequate understanding 



ERIC 




no 



of the theory-laden nature of scientific observations. That scientists work and interpret scientific 
“facts” from within certain frames of reference was not well understood. A majority of teachers 
(59%) also adopted a simplistic and hierarchical relationship between the various scientific 
constructs by which hypotheses become theories and theories become laws depending on the 
availability of supporting evidence. The fact that these constructs are different types of ideas was 
not grasped. Moreover, many teachers (59%) thought that scientists do not make assumptions in 
their work, or that they otherwise research any assumptions to prove them “true” before 
commencing their work. 

Knowledge of the Structure of the Discipline 

Teachers’ knowledge of the structure of their disciplines was not elaborate. This was 
reflected in the relatively low scores on the validity, congruence, salience and centrality of 
concepts dimensions, as well as the low holistic scores on their concept maps. 

Validity. Congruence. Salience and Centrality of Concepts 

Teachers’ scores on the four dimensions of their concept maps represent percentages ' 
derived by comparing each of these four dimensions on the teachers’ concept maps to those on 
the expert maps. 

Validity scores measure the scientific accuracy of the teachers’ concept maps. Validity 
scores ranged between 37 and 90. The majority of these scores (71%) were below 65 and 
reflected a relatively inaccurate knowledge base. Only one teacher had a validity score of 90. 
Salience reflects the percentage of the valid links expressed by each teacher out of all the links 

j 

provided by the teacher herself. Fifty eight percent of the teachers scored between 90 and 100 
and 24% scored between 75 and 90. These high salience scores indicate that teachers only 
produced those parts of their knowledge of which they were confident. However, the majority 




123 

in 



(82%) of the congruence scores —which measure the extent to which substantial or mandatory 
links were actualized on the teachers’ maps, were below 65. This indicates that the parts of 
knowledge that the teachers chose to represent on their maps did not fit what the disciplinary 
experts deemed important. 

A number of cognitive psychologists suggest that understanding a domain of knowledge is 
equivalent to understanding the relationships between the central concepts in that domain 
(Winitzky et al., 1994). Teachers were not successful in identifying the central concepts in the 
topics used in this study. The centrality of concepts score represents the percentage of central 
concepts on the teachers’ maps out of the total number of central concepts on the expert maps. 
The scores on central concepts ranged between 15 and 92. Fifteen scores (88%) were below 69. 
This reveals that teachers’ knowledge structures comprised at best isolated and non-integrated 
chunks of information. 

Holistic Scores for the Concept Maps 

To compute a holistic score for each of the concept maps, the number of valid links, cross- 
links, branches and valid levels of the hierarchy on each concept map were counted and scored. 
The scores were summed to derive a raw score for each map as a whole. This score was then 
compared to the raw score derived from the expert map and reported as a percentage. Table 2 
(see Appendix) presents these frequency counts, scores and percentages for teacher and expert 
maps categorized by disciplinary background (biology, chemistry or physics). 

What is evident from examining Table 2 is the markedly small number of cross-links that the 
teachers have mapped. Compared to 24 cross-links on the expert biology map, seven of the nine 
biology teachers mapped less than 7 cross-links. Compared to 12 cross-links on the chemistry 
expert map, four of the six chemistry teachers mapped 4 or less cross-links. Finally, compared to 



10 cross-links on the physics expert map, one teacher mapped 5 cross-links, while the other 
mapped only 1 . It seems that the teachers were not able to see beyond the simple and direct 
relationships that connect their concepts. This may reflect the lack of knowledge of a rich array 
of relationships between concepts since cross-links reflect the degree of knowledge integration. 

A quick look at the number of the valid levels of the hierarchy (see Table 2) on the 
constructed maps may be reassuring. The numbers in most cases approximate the number of 
levels of the hierarchy on the expert maps. But a closer look at the way these hierarchies were 
constructed raises important questions. On the expert biology map, the levels of the hierarchy 
were meant to reflect the parts of the digestive tract. This is one of the more simple but rather 
powerful modes of organizing the given set of concepts about digestion. The learner can follow 
the movement of food, the mechanical and/or chemical digestive activities taking place as well as 
the chemical agents involved at the level of each organ of the alimentary tract. Of the nine 
biology teachers, only four used the digestive tract to organize their hierarchies. As far as the 
chemistry concepts are concerned, only one of the six chemistry teachers used the mandatory 
compounds, elements, atoms and sub-atomic particles hierarchical relationship that was utilized to 
arrange the levels of the hierarchy on the expert map. Finally, the hierarchical relationships 
between motion and inter-particulate forces and the various forms of energy of atoms and 
molecules (kinetic, potential and internal energies) as represented on the expert physics concept 
map were absent from the maps constructed by the two physics teachers. Overall, the hierarchies 
constructed by the teachers did not reflect an elaborate subsumption of the relationships between 
the given sets of concepts. 

Table 3 (see Appendix) presents teacher groups’ average scores on validity, congruence and 
central concepts and their holistic scores. The only difference noteworthy is that teachers in the 



T. D. group scored better on all of the above measures than did teachers in the No T. D. group. 
Other differences, such as the low scores of the teachers with 7 and 8 years of teaching experience 
and those teaching secondary grade levels seem to reflect the low scores of teacher #1 rather than 
any other possible reason especially as there are only two teachers in each of these groups. No 
other important differences were evident neither between nor across the groups. 

Knowledge of the Function of the Discipline 

The number of valid everyday life examples or applications given by each teacher are 
presented in Table 4 (see Appendix). Four teachers (24%) were not able to give a single valid 
everyday life example of the topic or concepts addressed in their maps. Nine teachers (52 A>) gave 
less than five examples. 

Teachers had a difficult time coming up with everyday life examples. For instance, one 
chemistry teacher was able to give only a single example of ionic compounds, namely sodium 
chloride (table salt). When asked for another everyday life example, and after a long pause, the 
teacher said: “I don’t usually give an example ... I don’t relate it to something they see in life” 
(teacher #11). Another chemistry teacher gave magnesium chloride and silver nitrate as examples 
of ionic compounds. However, she could not tell where students may encounter such compounds 
in their lives (teacher # 4). 

Moreover, several teachers (e.g., teachers #1, #8 and #16) confused everyday life examples 
of concepts with analogies or using familiar things to explain certain concepts. For example, 
when asked to give everyday life examples of atoms, teacher # 16 said: “I tell my students that the 
nucleus is like a small, heavy iron ball situated at the center of a much larger plastic ball 
representing the electron cloud”. Other teachers gave incorrect examples. For instance teacher # 

O 

ERJC 



120 



114 



16 said that lemon juice contains acetic acid (which is found in vinegar), while in fact it contains 
citric acid. 

Many teachers were not able to explain the everyday life examples that they provided. For 
instance, one biology teacher listed sayings from everyday life related to digestion such as “don’t 
skip breakfast, don’t eat then go to sleep, have a walk after you have a meal, etc.” However, 
when asked how would she explain these to her students and relate them to digestion as a 
process, she said: “I am really not good at explaining these” (teacher #14). 

When teachers were not able to provide everyday life examples, several questions were used 
to assess their ability to explain or use such examples in their teaching. The physics and chemistry 
teachers were asked to provide a simple everyday life experience that can be used to convince 
students of the presence of particles (atoms and molecules). Only one out of eight teachers was 
able to give an appropriate example (an opened perfume bottle). The biology teachers were asked 
whether they thought that burgers and French fries were not healthy for their students. Four of 
the biology teachers thought that this meal is not problematic by itself. Three other teachers 
thought that this diet may cause digestive problems. When asked whether it is problematic to 
drink water directly after meals, five of the biology teachers thought that this slows digestion 
because acids in the stomach are diluted by the water.. Three other teachers thought that this is 
not problematic at all. Regardless of the disciplinary accuracy of responses to these questions, it 
can be noted that teachers lack a common knowledge base on such issues. Their answers are 
sometimes contradictory. For instance, biology teachers could not agree on what nutritive 
components are found in milk. 

Only one teacher (teacher # 6) was able to demonstrate knowledge of a wide range of 
everyday life examples and applications and provided about 18 examples and was ready to give 



many more. Moreover, this teacher was also capable of explaining the everyday life examples she 
gave in simplified ways. Examples here include why should students not swim directly after 
eating, or avoid having a heavy meal before going to sleep, etc. When it came to diet and 
nutrition, the teacher was able to tell what nutritive ingredients are found in many traditional 
Lebanese foods and what alternatives types of foods have similar nutritional values. Among the 
many examples given, the teacher said that she usually asks her students to avoid chocolate bars 
having sucrose. Being a double sugar, sucrose needs to be digested first and cannot be directly 
absorbed. As such it stays in the mouth and causes damage to the teeth. Students can 
alternatively have candy bars with the mono-saccharide glucose, which can be directly absorbed 
and as such causes much less problems. The teacher was able to give many commercial brand 
names of chocolate bars that contain glucose only. 

No important differences or trends were found when the numbers of everyday life examples 
provided by the teachers were averaged for teacher groups categorized according to the variables 
of interest. 

Knowledge of the Development of the Discipline 

Teachers did not demonstrate an adequate understanding of the developmental nature of 
science, or the developmental nature of students. Teachers failed to see that most science 
concepts can be taught in one form or another at any grade level. On the other hand, teachers 
were not knowledgeable of their students’ alternative conceptions regarding the target topics and 
concepts. 

Changes in the Concept Maps 

Of the nine biology teachers, three believed that no changes, neither in the structure of the 
map nor in the complexity of the links, were necessary. A fourth teacher believed that the 

128 




116 



concept of chemical digestion need only be presented in a simpler way. Four more teachers said 
they would omit some concepts, focus on mechanical digestion and present the concept of 
chemical digestion in a simplified way. The concepts omitted were different combinations of: 
peristalsis, salivary amylase, gastric fluid, pepsin, bile and intestinal enzymes. No two teachers 
omitted the same set of concepts. Teachers thought that students at the second intermediate 
grade level lack the prior knowledge necessary to present them with the concept of enzymes and 
their role in chemical digestion. And indeed helping students to realize the difference between 
mechanical and chemical digestion without going into the details of the chemistry of enzymes and 
chemical change was the major problem for these four biology teachers. One said that she would 
explicitly tell her students that “you will see this [chemical digestion] later” (teacher # 5). The 
other three attempted to provide simple explanations to help students differentiate mechanical 
from chemical digestion. The first teacher suggested that in chemical digestion “certain kinds of 
liquids ... act in a certain chemical way at a microscopic level” (teacher # 2). The concept of 
chemical change, however, went unexplained. The second teacher suggested that in mechanical 
digestion food is “broken down” while in chemical digestion food is “reduced” (teacher # 3). This 
may be problematic as both terms have very close meanings. The third teacher gave a more 
accurate picture when she said that she would replace mechanical digestion with “break down into 
small pieces” and chemical digestion with “changing substances into other things” (teacher # 12), 
but she failed to verbalize the idea further or to support it with activities or demonstrations. Only 
one of the biology teachers (teacher # 6) was able to give an alternate form by which to help 
students distinguish between chemical and mechanical digestion. For that purpose she would use 
a rather simple but powerful demonstration. With a scissors, she would cut a sheet of paper into 
small pieces. This is similar to mechanical digestion, although the paper (or food) is broken down 



O 

ERIC 



117 



into small pieces, it did not change, it still is paper. Now she would put the pieces in an ash tray 
and bum them. The paper now changes into something else: ashes, from which the paper can no 
longer be recovered. This is similar to chemical digestion where food is changed into ‘something 
else’. 

All six chemistry teachers maintained that they would keep the same structure of their maps. 
Two of the teachers believed that all of the concepts and relationships they mapped are teachable 
to 12-year old students. The other four teachers suggested that they would omit some concepts. 
The concepts eliminated were: subatomic particles (including electrons, protons and neutrons), 
energy levels, ions, ionic bonds, covalent bonds, single and double bonds and chemical symbols. 
Again no two teachers agreed on the set of concepts to be eliminated. None of the chemistry 
teachers suggested that these concepts can be simplified and presented to students. 

At the beginning of the interview the two physics teachers suggested that they would keep 
the same structure but simplify the concepts for 12-year old students. However, they were not 
sure about the form in which the concepts can be presented. As a result, they suggested omitting 
some of the concepts such as inter-particulate forces and absolute zero. They also thought that 
students cannot handle the labels (not the concepts): potential, kinetic and internal energy. 

Overall, five teachers (29%) made no changes in their maps. This may indicate that they are 
not aware of the developmental nature of their students’ thinking. Five more teachers (29%) kept 
the same structure and omitted several concepts from their maps. They found no problem in 
presenting concepts as isolated labels, independent of other intimately related concepts. Many did 
not seem to believe that most science concepts can be taught at any level in one form or another. 
While six more teachers (36%) thought that some concepts need to be simplified in order to be 
attainable by 12-year old students, they were not able to articulate those simplified forms. 



Each teacher gave one or more reasons for the changes on her concept map. Some teachers 
believed that age is the overriding factor behind the changes, others thought that the effect of 
prior knowledge outweighs that of age. This latter group of teachers suggested that given enough 
time they could teach any set of concepts to 12-year old students. Still other teachers suggested a 
combination of age, prior knowledge and the difficulty level of the concepts as the reason behind 
the changes they made. The fact that different justifications were given may suggest the lack of a 
consistent view among the teachers on this issue. 

i • 

Alternative Conceptions 

Overall, the number of valid alternative ideas provided by the teachers was strikingly small 
(see Table 4). Ten teachers (59%) said they knew of no misconceptions or spoke of things they 
had mistaken for misconceptions. 

Teachers did not have an adequate understanding of alternative conceptions. Many were 
unaware of the fact that such conceptions develop long before children receive any formal science 
teaching. Some teachers believed that students’ misconceptions on the topics discussed should be 
rare since students are introduced to such concepts for the first time (e.g., teachers #4 and #9). 
Teachers also were not aware that such conceptions persist and often survive formal science 
teaching. One teacher believed that upon explaining the concepts, her students “go out of these 
misconceptions by realizing what is true and . . . what is wrong” (teacher # 14). Another teacher 
(teacher # 1) believed that because the study of the concepts discussed is covered in all the 
intermediate classes, students were unlikely to develop any misconceptions. Those teachers who 
said they knew about their students’ misconceptions found a hard time enumerating them. One 
teacher said “I always encounter misconceptions . . . but I don’t have any clear examples in mind” 
(teacher # 17). Moreover, an overwhelming majority of the misconceptions that the teachers 



listed were confused with isolated misinformation or lack of information. Examples are that 
students “don’t have any idea about chemical digestion” (teacher # 6) or that “they don’t know 
anything about enzymes” (teacher # 5). Other teachers thought that when students have 
difficulties in understanding some concept that they were explaining then the students have a 
misconception (teachers #4, #9 and # 1 1). One teacher (teacher # 16) said that although she had 
studied about misconceptions during her T. D. program, she had no idea about her students naive 
ideas nor did she look for them. She preferred to think of her students as “blank, their minds are 
completely blank” and she usually starts from there and not from what the children already know. 

Again, no important differences or trends were found when the numbers of alternative 
conceptions provided by the teachers were averaged for teacher groups categorized according to 
the variables of interest. 

Finally, it should be noted that teachers who demonstrated competence in one dimension of 
their disciplinary knowledge did not do equally well on the others. Moreover, the most important 
finding is that teachers’ scores did not relate to their level of education. The scores of the T. D. 
and ‘No T. D.’ groups did not differ on all the dimensions except the better scores on the concept 
maps for the T. D. group. This may support what has been suggested about the inadequacy of 
teacher training programs in preparing prospective science teachers who are able to help their 
students achieve an attainable form of high scientific literacy. 

Discussion 

Shulman (1987) calls on teacher preparation programs to emphasize teachers’ content 
knowledge. These programs can no longer limit their efforts to content-free domains of pedagogy 
or effective classroom management behaviors. It follows that teacher preparation programs

should aim to enhance prospective teachers’ knowledge of the structure, function and 
development of science, and their understanding of the nature of science. 

Prospective teachers need ample opportunities to reflect on and to learn —or relearn, their 
science content in deeper and more connected ways. They need to integrate their science content 
into a structural framework that makes it more accessible and understandable to them in the first 
place. Prospective teachers should be helped to connect university science with everyday 
experiences to further their knowledge of the function of science, and should be helped to develop 
knowledge of students’ naive understandings and how these understandings affect students 
lear ning Moreover, prospective teachers need to develop understanding of the nature of science 
(Teacher Preparation in Michigan, 1994). But what is more important is that teacher preparation 
programs should provide prospective teachers with experiences on how to use their knowledge 
and understandings to help their students develop adequate understandings of science (Lederman, 
1992; Pomeroy, 1993; Tighter 1990). 

However, reform of teacher education seems to be guided by other agendas. The Carnegie 
Task Force (1986) and the Holmes group (1986) recommend higher standards for entry into 
teacher education programs including a greater number of years in higher education in the specific 
content areas and higher grade point averages. They also suggest that teacher preparation should 
include prolonged programs in theoretical and practical preparation. 

Nonetheless, such recommendations seem to put reform efforts on a circular track. On the 
one hand, requiring teacher candidates to take more of the didactic university science courses is 
unlikely to enhance their weak understanding of their content. This measure will only result in 
teachers having a more strongly held linear and fragmented conception of their subject matter 
(Gess-Newsome & Lederman, 1993; Stoddart et al., 1993). On the other hand, requiring student- 



teachers to take more courses at the department of education and to spend extended internships in 
cooperating schools would only serve to expose them to more content-free, generic education 
courses at that department and familiarize them at the schools with instructional methods that 
reformers are eager to change and for longer periods of time. 

Alternatively, “[w]hat is needed is a new form of teacher education where the development 
of subject matter knowledge and pedagogy are integrated” (Stoddart et al., 1993, p. 232). 

Reform efforts that stress helping students to develop conceptual understanding of science 
through innovative curricula and methods of instruction may fail if such recommendations on 
teaching and learning of science are not equally applied to teacher education (Nordland & Devito, 
1974; Stofflett & Stoddart, 1994). 

It can be rightly argued that ‘it takes the whole university to prepare a teacher’. “[TJeacher 
education is the responsibility of the entire university, [and] not the schools or departments of 
education alone” (Shulman, 1987, p. 20). A joint effort between science instructors at the various 
disciplinary departments and science educators is needed to help the former become aware of the 
needs of preservice teachers and consequently to model their instruction to conform with these 
needs (Anderson, 1987; Gabel & Rubba, 1978; Tighter, 1990; Zeitler, 1984). 

Anderson (1987), however, recognizes that there are institutional and personal barriers to a 
coordinated effort between science professors and science educators. Meanwhile, and until such 
coordination is possible, science educators continue to advance suggestions aimed to enhance the 
preparation of science teachers. In this respect Gess-Newsome & Lederman (1993) suggest that 
distinct content-specific science methods courses in the various disciplines should replace the 
general, content-free science methods courses that are currently emphasized in science teacher 
preparation programs. Content-specific methods courses are necessary to help prospective 



teachers reflect on, articulate and explicate their knowledge of science and the way they are going 
to teach it. 

However, while attempting to enhance teachers’ knowledge base, teacher educators should 
not ignore student-teachers as active learners and should help them to examine their content 
knowledge and their beliefs about teaching and learning (Stoddart et al., 1993; Stofflett & 
Stoddart, 1994). Otherwise, when student-teachers are presented with effective approaches to 
science instruction, they may revert back to the traditional methods of teaching that they were 
exposed to in their school and university studies. The conceptual change approach should replace 
the modeling approach currently utilized in methods courses. Thus, in addition to shifting 
emphasis from disseminating the general pedagogies of teaching and classroom management 
techniques to developing student-teachers’ disciplinary knowledge, content-specific methods 
courses should also adopt an alternative approach in presenting this knowledge. A process of 
conceptual change should replace modeling if student-teachers’ firmly held conceptions in content 
and pedagogy are to be challenged and reconstructed. 

Further research is needed to validate the characterization of the knowledge base for science 
teaching presented in this study. Research efforts in the near future should focus on investigating 
the relationship between the conceptualized components of the teachers’ disciplinary knowledge 
and their classroom behaviors. The aim would be to test whether knowledge of these components 
does in fact translate into classroom practices that can help students develop the desired 
understandings of science. If this proves to be the case, researchers interested in teacher 
education should focus on the knowledge base that need be employed in any possible content- 
specific science methods courses. Certain science themes or major theories that permeate science 
teaching in the middle and high school levels can be identified and the disciplinary knowledge 



needed to teach these topics can be collated. The effects of teachers’ having such a knowledge on 
helping students to develop conceptual understanding of science can be evaluated. 

Finally, it should be noted that the classroom is a very complex place. The manifold realties 
and constraints that govern, and the conditions necessary for good teaching are far more varied to 
be controlled or met by knowledge of the four suggested components alone. This knowledge may 
well be a necessary condition for good teaching but it should not be thought of as sufficient. 

Other variables such as the classroom social and cultural environments and individual differences 
among students are important factors that need to be researched to further our understanding of 
the complexities that govern good teaching and learning inside the science classroom.

STUDENT TEACHERS WITHIN CURRICULUM REFORM: DOES 
A LABEL MAKE A DIFFERENCE? 

Joan M. Whitworth, Morehead State University 

Introductory Remarks on the Importance of the Education of Teachers from the Pre- 
service Years and Continuing Throughout their Professional Careers. 

Educational change involves learning how to do something new. Given this, if 
there is any single factor crucial to change it is professional development. In its 
broadest definition professional development encompasses what teachers bring to 
the profession and what happens to them throughout their careers. . . the educator as 
life-long learner is the key to future reform (Fullan, 1991, p.289). 



Other researchers (Buttery, Haberman, and Houston, 1990, Sizer, 1987) have 
identified the need for reform in teacher education to go “hand-in-hand” with reform in the 
schools. But there is a minimal amount of research in teacher education, especially field 
experiences or student teaching. There exists a need to know what is occurring within the 
context of field experience and, also, a need to know what should be occurring (Guyton 
and McIntyre, 1990). 

Teaching is a profession where aspiring practitioners enter the field with 
preconceived beliefs and conceptions about teaching and learning acquired during the 12 
years or more they spent within the educational system. Lortie (1975) calls these prior 
experiences, where students form their ideas of what should go on in the classroom, the 




“apprenticeship of observation.” What aspiring teachers learn from teacher education is 
determined, at least in part, by the knowledge and beliefs they bring with them into 
teacher education (Calderhead and Robson, 1991; Grossman, 1991). 

This study is based on the philosophy that learning to teach, like all other learning, 
is constructive. It is a process of inquiry — the task of relating what one has encountered 
to one’s current ideas (Strike and Posner, 1985). It focuses on the creation of a learning 
environment instead of concentrating on a body of facts (Borko and Putnam, in press). 

According to cognitive theorists it is essential that an environment conducive for 
learning not be abstract and detached but closely connected with its physical and cultural 
contexts (West and Pines, 1985). For knowledge to be useful for teaching it must be 
linked to the context in which it is to be used. Methods classes, which present theory and 
associated teaching strategies detached from the classroom context, often are 
unsuccessful in creating teachers who teach differently. The student teaching site has the 
possibility of bridging the gap between theory and practice because it can provide this 
link between teaching and the context in which it is used. 

If teachers are to teach differently they must be exposed to situations which are 
different from their own traditional school experiences. According to Wood, Cobb, and 
Yackle (1990), not only new teachers, but teachers in general, cannot make changes in 
their knowledge and beliefs until they see something problematic in their own classroom. 
Educational reform sites that advocate change in educational practices and teaching 
strategies are believed to hold the best promise for changing the knowledge and belief 
systems of aspiring teachers. In this study it was my intention to test this belief in a 



context where reforms are demonstrated and new teachers have the opportunity to see that 



“something else” works, as well as actively participating in the process of making these 
new ideas work. 



The purpose of this study is to examine the influence of an educational reform 
environment on the development and retention of beliefs and knowledge of student 
teachers during the practice teaching segment of their teacher preparation program. 

According to Bullough, Knowles and Crow (1992) and Yin (1989) case studies 
are valuable when investigating situations where the researcher has little control in real- 
life situations. This method enables the researcher to preserve the integrity of the 
subjects’ experiences and meanings as well as encouraging sensitivity to changes within 
the context of the experience without being narrowly bound to preconceived courses of 
experimentation. 



Two student teachers, placed in a science education reform site for their student 
teaching experience, agreed to participate in this research study. Both student teachers 
had entered college immediately upon high school graduation and neither had worked at 
any other job or career prior to entering the teacher education program. At the time of 
this study they were in the final semester of a four-year middle grades teacher education 
program at Western State University (names of all persons, places, and institutions are 
pseudonyms.)

The Site 

The school district serves approximately 18,500 students in an urban environment 
of 50,000 people. Each of the district schools has a 50% minority population due to a 
federal mandate to racially integrate. Both schools participating in this study were grade 
6-8 middle schools with a student population of approximately 800. They were engaged 
in a state project to reform science education based on National Science Teachers’ 
Association (NSTA) Scope, Sequence, and Coordination (SS&C) and American 
Association for the Advancement of Science’s (AAAS) Project 2061. Although the 
curriculum in each classroom is based on the same principles, it has become 
individualized for each teacher and his/her specific classroom. 

Data Sources 

Student teachers’ conceptions of teaching/leaming and subject matter were 
obtained through interviews. Classroom observations documented by a written 
observational record and audiotapes were conducted in order to ascertain teacher 
practices. Later these two sets of data were compared in an effort to determine the 
degree of consistency between beliefs and practice. I also conducted interviews with 
cooperating teachers, university supervisors and university methods class instructors at 
various stages throughout the student teaching experience. A chronological account of 
data collection is presented below. 

Pilot Study. 

A pilot case study of one student teacher, Ron, placed in a grade 10-12 high 
school that had adopted several educational reforms, was a precursor to this research 
project. Although this pilot project only involved one student teacher, the duration was

the entire semester of student teaching and the research methods and data collection 
followed the ones outlined in the following sections. 

Background Information. 

As part of a previous case study I came to understand various components of the 
educational reform. Scope, Sequence, and Coordination (SS&C), from National Science 
Teachers Association’s (NSTA) and The State Project for Reform in Science Education’s 
(SPRSE) literature; classroom observations of project classrooms; and interviews with 
university SPRSE personnel, pilot teachers and school and district administrators. Other 
data, such as printed student handbooks, school newsletters, curriculum guides, and 
standardized student test scores were collected and analyzed to develop a picture of the 
school site. 

Initiation of Study. 

Prior to beginning student teaching experience, each subject composed a journal 
entry describing her personal beliefs about teaching and learning, including a metaphor of 
how she saw herself as teacher. Each pre-service teacher then diagrammed a content 
teaching area, listing the major concepts^ and the interrelationships among them. 
(Originally I requested that student teachers diagram the content area they would be 
teaching. When they were unable to perform this task, I asked them to choose the science 
subject matter area in which they had the most confidence.) The subjects performed this 
same task with what they perceived were the important elements and concerns about 
teaching. Immediately following this exercise I conducted an interview discussing and 
clarifying the journal entries and the two diagrams. 





137 



The first five weeks of the student teaching experience included a classroom 
management course which I observed. Before and after this class I interviewed the 
instructor to determine his beliefs about teaching, learning and the teaching of science; as 
well as the goals and objectives of the class. 

Throughout the Study. 

Three observational periods, spaced at regular intervals and varying from one 
week to three weeks, were scheduled. (The length of each visit was determined by the 
schedule of the school and the student teacher.) Classroom observations targeted teacher 
explanations and demonstrations, the representations used, the assignment of student 
tasks, and teacher-student interactions. 

Between observations I conducted informal interviews with students, cooperating 
teachers, administrators, and other staff members concerning their impressions of the 
reform project and the relationship between the project and student teaching. For one 
school day I shadowed each student teacher in order to obtain a “snap-shot” of a typical 
school day from her perspective. Besides observing classes I attended meetings, followed 
the student teacher during “hall duty” and participated in the “lunch room experience.” 

Throughout the semester student teachers provided classroom materials (tests, 
quizzes, worksheets, etc.) and copies of their lesson plans. Each student teacher also 
kept a journal. 

Conclusion of the Study . 

I conducted a second formal interview of the student teachers during the last week 
of the field experience, following the focus and structure of the introductory interview. 



First, I asked each student teacher to draw two diagrams (science subject matter concepts 
and teaching and learning concepts) similar to those constructed at the beginning of the 
study. I asked the student teachers to compare their current views with their responses 
given during the first interview. 

I also conducted final interviews with each cooperating teacher and university supervisor. 
Copies of written journals and audiotaped journals were provided to me. I also kept a 
personal journal. 



Results 

During the formal analysis stage I followed the original theoretical propositions 
that led to the case study (Yin, 1989), rereading the original research questions and 
forming a domain and preliminary taxonomic analysis. The domains were then used to 
construct the descriptive framework of the cases. 



ERIC 



In order to determine the depth and breadth of the reform at each site I charted the 
features of each reform effort, listed differences between features described in the 
national SS&C literature and the reality of the school site, and charted the student 
teachers’ involvement in the reform at each site. The development of the student 
teachers’ beliefs, and practices during the student teaching experience was determined by 
matching their practice with their stated beliefs and documenting any discrepancies or 
changes. I then matched patterns predicted from the conceptual framework, literature 
review, and pilot study with patterns identified in the case studies. 

I expanded the pattern-matching strategy to include explanation-building (Yin, 
1989). For example, when I found that the collaboration observed in the pilot study was 



1 



not present at either research site, I looked for similarities and differences across the sites 
which could explain the reason for the discrepancy. 

I compared the two case studies of this research project with each other, and with 
the pilot study in order to generate alternate explanations and create a cross-case analysis. 
In the following sections I endeavor to generate a collage of student teacher beliefs, 
subject matter knowledge, classroom practices, and the interrelationships of all three. 
When possible I use the words of the participants in this study and paint a picture of the 
classroom using vignettes generated by classroom observation. I begin the story with 
Marilyn, a student teacher placed in a 7 th grade science class at Fairview Middle School. 

Student Teacher Beliefs 

Marilyn 

During the pre-student teaching interview Marilyn described 
her view of the perfect teacher. (She was unable to think of a metaphor.) 

I think you should make your classes interesting. I don’t think it should be just 
textbook-styled. You should bring the students into your class. It should be 
inviting... and they should not just walk into class and it just be the same thing 
everyday. It should be fim, not routine. 

Marilyn discussed the teaching methods she would use. 

Cooperative learning and forums. Set up forums in the classroom. And set your 
class up in circles. Talk to the students and make them feel welcome. Make the class 
atmosphere fim. Put posters up everywhere and make everything enjoyable. When 



140 152 



you teach, don’t just stand up in front of the class and lecture. Bring the students in 
and have them get up in front of the class and lecture. Have them get up there and 
talk about a subject. Make them welcome and just have fun. Don’t make it teacher- 
oriented but student- oriented. 

Marilyn discussed the importance of not overwhelming the students and pacing 
learning to meet the needs of students. Although she did not use the word, tracking, she 
said she did not believe in “mixing everybody together.” Students should be grouped 
according to ability level. In conclusion Marilyn drew a diagram representing her view of 
student learning and the interaction of the factors influencing student learning (Figure 1). 

Second visit. Halfway through the student teaching experience Marilyn went home to 
discuss her problems in student teaching with her father. She was having serious 
reservations about continuing in the program. Student teaching was nothing like she 
expected. Her cooperating teacher, Connie, reported that Marilyn was having serious 
problems with classroom discipline, subject matter knowledge, and lesson planning. 
Communication problems had developed between Marilyn and Connie. They had 
stopped talking to each other. Connie reported that Marilyn ignored instructions to 
improve her teaching and Marilyn felt that Connie was unreasonable in her expectations. 

Marilyn decided to return to student teaching in order to graduate, but not to 
teach. During the next three weeks Marilyn did not teach any classes. Her cooperating 
teacher and university supervisor relieved her of all teaching responsibilities. She worked 
independently, researching the subject matter and planning the science classes she was 
expected to teach later in the semester.

After Marilyn resumed her teaching responsibilities, she was no longer concerned 
about the reform program or the best way to teach; she was only concerned with survival 
in the classroom. Her frustration was evident in her journal entry the day she returned to 
teaching. 

Today was a terrible day. The student [sic] were not listening to anything I said 
today. I felt they could not hear anything that I was saying. I am so upset and it is 
making me think again about being a teacher. I like to teacher [sic] the material but 
the major responsible [sic] of the teacher is the discipline. 

At the end of the student teaching experience Marilyn supplied a metaphor of a teacher. 

Yes, a disciplinarian. Basically that’s what I believe. There’s not much learning 
going on, just disciplining, asking them to be quiet and calming them down. They 
come to your classroom and don’t know how to behave. I think teaching and learning 
are miles apart. I mean, you can try to teach but it seems like nothing gets across to 
them no matter what you do. I don’t think that students today want to learn. I feel 
that they’d rather just sit there and do what they want to do rather than sit there and 
try to learn anything. 

As Marilyn diagrammed her view of teaching and learning, she drew two circles, 
one for teaching and one for learning, and wrote “miles apart” between them. Under the 
diagrams she wrote the phrase, “Student [sic] today do not want to learn.” (figure 2). 

Later I asked Marilyn about her ideas concerning teaching. I would use less activity. 
It’s pretty well all activity-based now. I’d use less and use a textbook. I’d write on 
the board what the kids really need to know. I feel that that should be enough. 



Then I asked Marilyn, “From your experiences how do you think students learn?” 



“Kids don’t learn!” 

Laura 

Both student teachers were engaged in their field experiences during the same 
semester but Laura, the other student teacher, was placed at Gateway Middle School on 
the other side of the river. During the first interview Laura described her “ideal” class as 
the students being actively engaged in activities and experiments because “they remember 
better when they do it.” She wanted to make her class “inviting” and friendly “so that 
they could come to me with their problems.” Laura described a teacher as... 

A doctor or the mother of an animal, always looking out for and watching over the 
students. 

She said that her classes would be neither student-centered nor teacher-centered. 

From what I’ve seen student-directed classes are a disaster. I would have student 
input but it would be limited. I would have a class that was in-between. The teacher 
would be in charge but the studentsjwould have some input. 

Laura diagrammed her view of teaching and student learning. 

(See Figure 5) She drew student learning in the center of the page with lines 
radiating from it to represent the 1 1 factors that she believed influenced student learning. 
Five of these factors involved the students’ motivation to learn: new, fun, exciting, 
interest (connection to everyday life), and desire.

Figure 5. Marilyn's Diagram of Biological Concepts 




After teaching for two weeks, Laura remarked that she was enjoying student 
teaching. She had developed good rapport with the students, talking easily with them and 
them with her. Laura listed her major concern as the lack of a textbook and equipment 
for doing the science education reform activities. She admitted that she had lost some of 
her enthusiasm for teaching science and liked teaching mathematics more. 

It’s hard to determine if the students got the concepts and also harder to plan. I 
like math because it’s more structured, easier to test and plan. 

Like Marilyn, Laura was concerned with discipline problems. 

...the kids talk a lot and I often have problems getting them back . . . kids aren’t use 
to cooperative groups so they talk or want to want to work with others in other 
groups. 

Toward the end of the student teaching experience Laura used Project Wild 
lessons. (She was trained and certified during an earlier experience.) Her Project Wild 
lessons were more student-centered and she relied less on textbook definitions and notes. 

At the conclusion of the student teaching experience Laura gave her same 
metaphor of a teacher. 

I still agree that a teacher is like a mother or a baby-sitter, especially at this age. 

Laura began her diagram of teaching and learning by writing good teaching in the center 
of the page, circling these words and drawing lines radiating outward from the words 
“good teaching” to all the ingredients she felt went into “good teaching.” (See Figure 6).

Figure 6. Marilyn's Diagram of Weather Concepts

Laura recalled her experiences during this past semester and described how she thinks 
students learn. 

Kids learn by doing. If they do an activity or an experiment ... and then being quizzed 
on it everyday. Drill and practice, that’s how I learned. 

Keeping this view of how students learned, she described what she did in her classes. 

Well, I don’t do it everyday, but as Dr. Shearer said, focus on the review. I’ll have 
them go over what I want them to know at the beginning (of class) like definitions, 
and also a lot of hands-on activities. 

Laura said her view of teaching had changed over the semester. She stated that 
she did not realize the struggle to keep students’ attention and the amount of energy that 
middle school students seem to possess. Although her original view of teaching was 
never totally student-centered she moved even closer to a teacher-controlled model. 

There’s a lot more to it. I think it would be easier to teach at a higher level. But at 
this level (6 th grade) you have to always be calming them (students) down and getting 
them to be quiet ... You have to spend a lot of time on class control and discipline. 

She related her views of the science reform project. 

Well, I like some things, some of the topics. But I think the students should have a 
pamphlet of resources or something they can take home. 

She felt the reform required a lot of extra work, such as going to the library and the 
university for materials. If given a choice she would not use the reform exclusively. She 



ERIC 




149 



felt that that some of the activities were unrealistic — taking students on field trips or to a 
pond. 

At the end of the final interview Laura shared her plans for the future. 

I think I’ll teach for awhile, but I’m not sure. It’s a lot of work for little money. Of 
course that’s not why you teach. I’m thinking about going into some area of 
medicine. I was in that but I left because I didn’t like the chemistry. But I was young 
and didn’t want to study. So I’m thinking about going back into it. 

Subject Matter Knowledge 
Marilyn 

At the beginning of the semester Marilyn said she felt the most prepared to teach 
science of her two concentrations, math and science. Her collegiate subject knowledge 
preparation in science included the following: two semesters of chemistry; two semesters 
of biology; and one semester of microbiology. Since she had not studied any physics, I 
asked Marilyn if she felt comfortable teaching her first science unit, velocity and motion. 

Not comfortable, not really comfortable at all... because Dr. Baker’s class was at 
the same time as the physics class, so I didn’t get the physical science class. I’m 
not strong in that at all so I’m going to have to do a lot of my own research. I’m 
probably going to have to go back to my professors and ask them for help and 




advice. 



Marilyn could not diagram the subject matter area she would be teaching, so she 
chose to draw a diagram depicting important concepts in biology and their relationships. 
(Figure 3).Marilyn discussed her conception of biology as she drew. 

The different parts of biology would be the physical parts, the chemical parts, when 
you talk about the Krebs Cycle. And then if it was my lesson plan for the day I would 
go out and draw the Krebs Cycle. In biology there’s three parts to it. There’s the 
physical, the bones and such. Then there’s the chemical parts, the Kreb’s Cycle. I 
think there’s your physical parts, that’s your body. You have your chemical parts, 
that’s inside of you, and then you have your outside. And then how you interact with 
the environment. It’s like biological interaction. 

At the end of the first week Marilyn’s cooperating teacher expressed frustration. She 
reported that when students asked Marilyn a question, “she does not know how to 
respond. She just continues like it wasn’t even said.” 

When Marilyn returned to teaching at the end of April (after being relieved of her 
teaching responsibilities) she taught the unit on weather. Although she said she felt more 
comfortable with this unit, I noticed numerous errors in content, such as the incorrect 
placement of the ionosphere on an overhead transparency. Several times Marilyn could 
not know explain discrepancies between results students obtained in a laboratory activity 
and the textbook. On one occasion she asked the class the following question: 

I told Brian that he has air pressure pushing down on him, why doesn’t he 
explode?

During four observations students gave wrong answers in class discussions and 
Marilyn did not correct them. She ignored students when they asked, “What are 
millibars?” and “How do radio waves effect the ozone layer?” 

Misinformation verbalized by Marilyn included the following: high pressure means 
the density of the air is falling; increasing air pressure indicates low pressure and sunny 
weather; and she incorrectly described an aneroid barometer. 

During the final interview Marilyn stated she gained all her knowledge of weather 
from personal experiences: she did not have any university classes on meteorology or 
weather. She felt this level of knowledge was sufficient and was unaware of her 
misconceptions. 

Marilyn chose to diagram weather concepts for her final subject matter concept drawing. 
She said she felt comfortable teaching it and it was “fresh in her mind.” (See Figure 4). 

As she drew she talked. 

You have the atmosphere. You have two parts of the atmosphere. You have air and 
water. You have three parts of air. You have oxygen, carbon, and it’s 20, 21% 
depending on the book you look at, and carbon, nitrogen, and.. .Carbon is like carbon 
and argon and add up to 1%. And like it’s 79% nitrogen, and the atmosphere, it can 
consist of a lot of things, air. You can take oxygen, carbon, nitrogen. Talk about all 
the different reactions you can have. Oxygen and how you breathe in oxygen and 
give off carbon dioxide, and nitrogen also. You can go into how you can have rust on 
them also; what would happen if you would have more oxygen in the air; how much 
faster things would rust; how fast things would bum. And then you have water, and 



iS\ 




CM 



you have these different types. You have solid, liquid, and gas. And all these are in 
the atmosphere and this is how you have your weather, the interaction of all these. 
You have the solid, the clouds which are in the atmosphere and then the troposphere. 
All these clouds are in the troposphere and how all this interacts together. You have 
your solid as snow, sleet and then liquid is rain. And then gas forms are fog, and they 
can see that to begin with. Then you can go into how everything works together. 

Marilyn explained that she prepared for class by taking notes from a textbook and 
writing down questions to ask in class. “I write it down and then have it in front of me 
when I talk in class. I don’t have enough confidence to speak without notes in front of 
the kids.” She said one of her biggest problems was never knowing what questions the 
kids were going to ask. 

As expected with Marilyn’s lack of subject matter knowledge, she often verbalized 
that sh,e did not know how to present concepts to the students and her cooperating teacher 
commented that she was so preoccupied with facts that she lost sight of how to promote 
student understanding. 

I’ve tried to show her that there are many different ways to give information to the 
students - that was suppose to be the point of today’s lesson, guiding the students to 
find their own information and applying some common sense to it. But Marilyn got 
so hung up on facts that she lost sight of the major concepts. 

By Marilyn’s own admission she took facts directly from a book, placed them on an 
overhead, or had the students read the facts directly from the book. She presented 
activities in a very structured manner, doing the activity step-by-step as a demonstration 




173 



155 



prior to the students doing the activity. Marilyn was absorbed by mechanical details of 
executing the activities and missed the point behind doing the activity or what the 
students should gain from the exercise. 

Laura 

Laura’s college science courses included one semester of each of the following: 
biology, geology, environmental biology, chemistry, and astronomy. She elected not to 
take physics because she found chemistry difficult and thought physics would be 
impossible to pass. She described her science courses as primarily lecture courses. Only 
environmental biology and astronomy contained a laboratory component. She identified 
the lack of lab courses as one deficiency in her teacher preparation program. 

I think we should have had the labs. I think you look at things differently when 
you had the lab. We need more labs to do the hands-on. They don’t want us to 
lecture to our kids, so why are all our classes lecture. I think they need special 
science classes for teachers that are different from the ones everyone else takes. 

Although she stated that she feltconfident teaching her first science unit, rocks 
and minerals - she had recently completed a geology course - she elected to draw her 
subject matter diagram on astronomy during the pre-student teaching interview. (See 
Figure 7). 

She wrote the word planets above astronomy and drew lines radiating out from both 
planets and astronomy. Relationships between concepts appeared unclear and when I 
prompted her to explain the connections she could not explain or give reasons why she 
placed the concepts as she did. 



Figure 1. Laura's Astronomy Diagram 




157 



Examples from classroom observations 

In Laura’s science classes I observed the information she presented to students often 
superficial and incomplete. For example during a lesson explaining animal 

adaptation she wrote on the chalk board. 

Polar bears adapt to ice fields and snowy areas. Plants and animals that live in the 
desert have adapted to heat and little moisture. 

She never addressed how the animals adapted to these conditions. During a 
subsequent activity students researched a variety of environments, identified animals that 
lived in that environment and the conditions needing special adaptations. Animal 
structures and behaviors which allowed them to live under such conditions were not 
identified. 

Also, neither the teacher nor the students made any distinction between the river 
environments in moderate and tropical climates. Students listed beavers, hippopotamuses 
and flamingos as living together. Laura made no correction nor gave any explanation. 

Laura elected to diagram the unit she taught on rocks for her final diagram of 
subject-matter knowledge. As in her first interview she had a problem organizing and 
making connections among concepts. (See Figure 8). She also shared her feelings of 
uncertainty concerning how to teach a concept and what the students were to gain from a 
lesson.

Practice 



The purpose of looking at student teacher practice is to determine if and how 
student teacher beliefs translate into classroom practice, as well as to determine if there 
was a mismatch between the beliefs student teachers profess and their actual classroom 
behaviors and practices. The following vignette of a classroom situation during the final 
week of student teaching demonstrates how Marilyn’s struggle with class management 
prevented her from executing a SPRSE lesson. The experiment, designed and executed 
by the students, was the culminating activity for the unit and the end of unit student 
assessment. 

Vignette: Science Class 

The student teacher, Marilyn, walks over and flips on the overhead projector light 
The question. What will roll down the hill faster a ping pong ball or a basketball? appears 
on the screen at the front of the room. Marilyn directs the students’ attention to the 
question but is interrupted by a group of students talking loudly. She stops and corrects 
the students, “If you don’t quiet down. I’ll make you write questions from the book!” A 
student in the back of the room responds loud enough to be heard by the rest of the class, 
“She won’t make us do it. She’s a whimp!” 

Marilyn explains that she wants each group to design and perform an experiment 
to answer the question presented. They are to collect data and decide on a format to 
present their results to the class. She explains that this activity will serve as their final 
assessment on the unit and will take the place of a test. Marilyn directs the students to 



ERIC 



160 




“get into their groups and start working.” Again she threatens to suspend the activity and 
have the students write if they don’t get to work. 

While the students are working in groups Marilyn passes out ping pong balls and 
basketballs. Many of the students begin bouncing and rolling the balls. Two or three 
groups appear to be working but the majority of the class is either talking about other 
non-science activities or playing with the balls and other equipment in the room. 

Marilyn circulates from group to group, encouraging the students to “get to work” 
with few results. The students return to their off task behavior as soon as the student 
teacher moves to the next group. 

Although the original intention of the lesson, to present a problem and have the 
students design and conduct an experiment to solve the problem, matched the philosophy 
of the science reform project the goals were never met because of class management 
problems. The class degenerated into pockets of noise and the students were playing with 
equipment that had been placed on the tables in anticipation of the activity. 

Other times during the semester I observed the student teacher attempt activities 
that demanded student involvement and problem solving, only to have the original 
activity altered by student behavior or the anticipation of behavioral problems. Reports 
from the cooperating teacher and university supervisor confirmed my observations. The 
following situation describes the science class in the preceding vignette several days later. 

Vignette: Science Class: Later that Week 

Marilyn introduces the lesson by stating, “We’re going to do an activity. I’ll do 
the activity first. You watch me and then you’ll do it.” 



At Marilyn’s request a student to reads the purpose of the activity from a hand- 
out, followed by a second student reading off a list of materials. The Marilyn holds up 
each piece of equipment as the student reads its name. Various students read each step of 
the procedure with Marilyn performing each action it is read. While this is going on 
students are throwing paper wads, talking loudly, hitting one another with rulers and 
generally not paying attention. 

After these step-by-step instructions are completed, Marilyn directs the class to do 
the same lab in their groups. Few groups do the lab. Most of the students use this time to 
socialize and engage in disruptive behaviors. 

The cooperating teacher reported that often Marilyn was unsure of how to respond 
to classroom behavior, so she simply ignored the disruption, going on with the class as if 
it were not happening. Classroom discipline problems caused the student teacher to shift 
from student involved lessons to more teacher directed lessons. 

Generally Marilyn’s classes followed the pattern: present information by students 
reading information from a textbook or the overhead; “verbalization” with the students 
(usually this was a failed attempt because of discipline problems); a student activity 
(cooperative or individual); and finishing with students copying information - definitions, 
terminology - from the overhead or a book. 

I used Marilyn’s lesson plans as the data source in determining her goals for 
student learning. Because she was attempting to use SPRSE materials — including lesson 
plans as they were given to her — few of the goals were her own. When I questioned her 




162 182 



during interviews concerning student goals she had difficulty articulating any goals 
beyond getting the students to behave. 

Laura’s lesson plans and class presentations followed the six point lesson plan: 
focus and review, statement of objective, teacher input, guided practice, independent 
practice, and closure-a lesson formula which reportedly was advocated in her methods 
courses. 

Teacher input occupied a large percentage of class time. In about 50% of the 
classes (data obtained through classroom observations and lesson plans) Laura already 
had notes on the board when the students entered the room. During class she would read 
the notes aloud and have the students copy the notes, independent practice consisted of a 
homework assignment such as, writing a paragraph about rock changes, collecting rock 
and soil samples, or completing a worksheet. 

During closure Laura would either ask a student to summarize the lesson or ask 
questions about an activity. On a few occasions the students reviewed definitions for 
closure. 

Laura obtained the activities she used from a variety of sources: activities from 
methods classes, textbooks and lab manuals obtained from the university library, 
convention materials, and Project Wild (She attended a ten hour training session for this 
project). But she seldom used the science reform materials. She explained that the 
school did not have the necessary materials and that many activities were unrealistic (e.g., 
taking students out of the classroom for outdoor experiences or field trips). Laura 




163 



183 



expressed her opinion that taking the students out of the classroom would mean a loss of 
student control. 

Test questions usually asked students to recall class notes. 

Samples of test questions included the following: 

1 . List the layers of the soil. 

2. List the layers of the atmosphere. 

3. Name the gaseous layer that covers the earth and acts like a blanket. 

Discussion 

The findings of this study document the importance of the environment in which 
the student teacher learns how to integrate educational theory within their classroom 
practice. One premise of this study was that student teachers must be exposed to teaching 
situations which are different from their own traditional school experiences, if they were 
to teach differently. 

The two research sites for this study, along with the site for the pilot study, 
provided very different environments for the student teaching experience. The pilot study 
was conducted at a senior (grades 10-12) high school engaged in a large scale school 
reform. The focus of the pilot study was the Integrated American Studies Core which 
integrated English, science, and social studies for 10 th grade students. This reform was a 
local effort and was not part of any state or national program. Each teacher was a 



member of an interdisciplinary team and all team members were actively engaged in the 
reform. 

In contrast the two research sites for this study were middle schools (grades 6-8) 
involved in a statewide effort to enact a national science reform project. Although each 
teacher was a member of an interdisciplinary team only the science teachers were 
participating in the reform. Despite the fact that both schools were enacting the same 
state science project, the reform looked different at each school. One of the principal 
differences was that one school, Fairview Middle School, was invited to be a pilot school 
for the project. (The teachers voted to participate and became curriculum writers for the 
project). At Gateway Middle School the principal made the decision to be involved in 
the science reform, and the teachers were given a curriculum other teachers had written. 

During the pilot study for this research project I identified several features of the 
reform environment that were potentially valuable to student teachers: the principal 
players are open to new ideas and collaborate together to bring about change; the teachers 
are treated as professionals and are encouraged to develop curriculum, teaching strategies, 
and assessment instruments for their students; the teachers are encouraged to experiment 
and receive non-threatening feedback from other “team members”; and a support system 
(teachers and/or other professionals who can counsel, provide encouragement, and 
sometimes just listen) exists for the teachers as they experiment with new curriculum and 
innovative strategies. 

Although I found many of these features present at Fairview Middle School, the 
feeling of openness to new ideas and collaboration among teachers did not extend to the 



student teacher. The science teachers, especially during the first two years of writing and 
implementing the reform, were open to new ideas and collaborated together. The 
university provided a support network — professors and graduate students who made 
school visits, encouraged the teachers, served as resource people, and transmitted 
information among the various pilot schools. After the original implementation process 
was completed the teachers retreated into their individual classrooms, using the reform 
project science in a manner and to the degree of their choice. There was little 
communication among the science teachers, especially of different grade levels and with 
new teachers. 

At Gateway the teachers were focused on classroom control issues which made 
them reluctant to try new strategies which, they felt, could result in management 
problems. Because Gateway Middle School was not a reform project pilot school, they 
did not receive the same level of university support. 

One advantage of the Rockview field site, which contributed to the development 
of the student teacher, was Ron’s (the student teacher’s) acceptance as a full participating 
member of the team. He was invited to try different teaching and assessment strategies 
with the classes in a non-threatening atmosphere. Other team members, including his 
cooperating teacher, did not criticize but made recommendations and suggestions. 

The student teachers at both Fairview and Gateway Middle Schools did not have 
the opportunity to collaborate, engage in team planning, or participate in the inservice 
associated with the reform. In fact, even though the cooperating teachers were involved 
in the reform, they encouraged the student teachers to teach in more traditional ways. 



Laura’s cooperating teacher, Theresa, did not really believe in the reform and Connie felt 
that Marilyn, her student teacher, was not experienced enough to handle the teaching 
strategies associated with the reform. 

Marilyn’s lesson plans consisted only of materials provided by her cooperating 
teacher or the other seventh grade science teacher. She did not deviate from the pre- 
selected lessons because she felt that she only had one opportunity to “get it right” when 
teaching a lesson. In her mind there was no opportunity to experiment. She felt, “you 
(student teacher) have to teach as your cooperating teacher teaches.” Marilyn believed 
that both her cooperating teacher and university supervisor held her to one preset teaching 
formula and were critical if she deviated from the expected. 

When problems developed Marilyn would not ask for help, and her cooperating 
teacher and university supervisor had given up on her. The lines of communication 
among the principal players — student teacher, cooperating teacher, and university 
supervisor — were completely “shut down”. By the middle of the semester Marilyn was 
only worried about getting through each lesson, and ultimately getting through student 
teaching — not even getting through successfully — just getting through. Tabachnick and 
Zeichner (1984) criticize most student teaching experiences because of this fact: the 
student teachers are mainly concerned with the pragmatic aspects of teaching or “just 
getting through the lesson” as seen with Laura and Marilyn. The pilot study with Ron 
demonstrates that although this is true in many cases it does not have to be. 

The cooperating teacher was found to be a profound influence on the student 
teachers in this study. Ron’s cooperating teacher, Steve, had previously been a professor 



in the local university’s teacher induction program. Therefore he is well informed in both 
educational theory and practice. He has extensive experience working with beginning 
teachers and is willing to devote many hours of his own time to help a new teacher. 
According to Ron’s journal his cooperating teacher worked with him for six or seven 
hours on a weekend, planning for the following week. When problems arose he helped 
Ron work through the difficulties, giving him suggestions and support, instead of 
encouraging the abandonment of new teaching strategies. 

Although the other two cooperating teachers had excellent reputations within their 
own buildings, neither one had Steve’s degree of experience working with student 
teachers. They also expressed feelings that they were overworked and just did not have 
the time needed to do everything: teach; write and collaborate on the reform curriculum; 
and attend meetings and workshops required by the school. Consequently if the student 
teacher needed extra assistance the time just was not there for her. 

Connie and Theresa communicated their beliefs to the student teachers in their 
charge and their practice served as a model of how to teach. They focused on the 
mechanics of the program and expressed the view that the reform was difficult to teach. 
They never referred to the underlying philosophy of the project or how working with the 
program could help the student teachers promote learning in their students. 

Unlike Marilyn, Laura had a good working relationship with her cooperating 
teacher. At the beginning of the experience Laura attempted to incorporate some aspects 
of the reform into her lessons but her cooperating teacher discouraged the use of the 
reform in many subtle ways. For example when Laura gave an open-ended test on which 




168 



many students received low grades, Theresa (the cooperating teacher) encouraged her to 
give an objective test. When discipline problems arose Theresa suggested having the 
students read and answer questions in a textbook. Gradually Laura assimilated her 
cooperating teacher’s view of the science reform program and came to believe in the 
same teacher-centered model as her cooperating teacher. 

This study found, that at both Fairview and Gateway, the student teachers’ beliefs 
about teaching and learning were overshadowed by problems with classroom 
management and discipline, as well as limited subject-matter and pedagogical content 
knowledge. Marilyn never really got at “how to teach” or “how students learn” because 
she was never in control of the class and Laura was afraid to “let the kids go.” 

Both Marilyn and Laura attributed the failure of the student teaching experience to 
an unrealistic view of teaching and of students from their university experiences, as well 
as, their own early school experiences. Often Marilyn talked about how she remembered 
herself as a middle school student and her dismay that her own students did not behave in 
the same manner. They also stated that university education courses stressed making 
classes fun and interesting, but did not make them aware that many students would not be 
interested in what they had to teach. 

Marilyn recognized her lack of subject matter knowledge as a liability during the 
first half of the semester but stated that her knowledge of weather was sufficient. Laura 
felt that a lack of laboratory experiences in her teacher preparation left her unprepared to 
teach SPRSE Science. Although, throughout the semester both student teachers 




169 



verbalized their struggle with “how to teach,” they failed to view their lack of subject 
matter knowledge as contributing to this problem. 

The student teachers began their experiences with the reform project with less 
preparation in the major elements of the reform than the experienced teachers who 
originally implemented the project. The science teachers at Fairview Middle School had 
the benefit of a two week summer institute in which they were introduced to the 
principles of the reform, gained some experience with the associated teaching strategies, 
and became involved with collaboratively writing reform curricula. The student teachers 
did not have an opportunity to attend the summer institute nor did they receive the 
university support accorded the classroom teachers when they began implementing the 
project. 

Although Ron exhibited some of the same inadequacies as Marilyn and Laura, he 
was able to overcome problems and develop into a competent and caring teacher because 
he was placed in an atmosphere that encouraged the student teacher to experiment, 
engaged the student teacher as a full participant in the schooling process, and provided a 
support system when he needed it. 

Conclusion 

Previous to student teaching Marilyn and Laura, the student teachers in this study, 
expressed very idealistic views of teaching and learning. But many of their ideas 
changed when faced with keeping the students’ attention and coping with classroom 




170 ISO 



problems on a daily basis. Both student teachers reverted to a teacher-centered model of 
instruction and viewing science as a body of facts to be presented to their students. 

Student discipline issues at the two sites were a major factor which dispelled 
many of the student teachers’ beliefs concerning increased student involvement in the 
classroom and created an issue that they could not resolve. They adopted the belief of 
their cooperating teachers that the choice was either class control or the reform project. 

The most significant determining factors of how the student teachers taught were 
their knowledge of the subject area and concerns of classroom management. Their beliefs 
about teaching and learning had shifted from a focus on how students learn (prior to 
student teaching) to how teachers should teach (at the end of the experience). During 
informal discussions at the end of the experience, Laura expressed her belief that students 
need drill and practice — because that was how she learned — and the value of a quiet, 
orderly classroom. Marilyn was less articulate concerning her beliefs about teaching and 
learning at the end of the experience. She expressed her frustration with the students and 
talked about her efforts to regain control of the classroom. Even when prompted she 
refused to discuss how students learn. Both student teachers’ practice at the end of the 
experience reflected this shift toward teacher-centered instruction. 

Although reform programs were operating at both schools, the student teaching 
situations were not different from traditional classroom situations. The student teachers 
were not actively involved with any of the changes advocated by the reform, and no 
opportunities were provided for reflection.

In this study the reform project curriculum was expected to be a driving force 
which would influence the school and the students. In reality the school (especially the 
teachers) and the students had a profound effect on the manifestation of the reform 
project in each classroom — including the student teachers’ classrooms. The cooperating 
teachers were a powerful influence during the field experience. Their beliefs were 
communicated to the student teachers in their charge and their practice served as a model 
of how to teach. Both cooperating teachers focused on the mechanics of the program, and 
student discipline. 

The experience with the reform project had the effect of “turning these student 
teachers off’ to educational reform efforts and teaching in general. 

Implications for Teacher Educators 

With the current movement for educational reform in this country there exists a 
need for teachers who “teach differently.” The problem is how to produce teachers who 
have the beliefs, knowledge and practice which are consistent with today’s reform efforts. 
One thought is to expose pre-service teachers to these ideas early in their teacher 
preparation programs and have them engage in practice teaching in schools participating 
in the reforms. 

Recommendations 

1 . Communication. From the results of the pilot study and the two case studies of this 
research project the single most critical issue in the field experience is simply people 
talking to other people. Linn (1992) recommended that collaboration and 



O 

ERIC 



172 192 



communications include all individuals involved in teacher education. Not only 
should people talk to one another but the level of communication is also important. 
Instead of the student teacher being treated as a student and told what to do, as in the 
case of the two student teachers (Laura and Marilyn), the student teachers should be 
included as part of the team (student teacher, cooperating teacher, university 
supervisor and other teacher involved in teaching the same students). 

2. Selection of schools for field experiences. In order to derive maximum benefit from 
such a teacher preparation program the schools must be carefully selected to be 
certain that a true reform environment exists. Cooperating teachers and university 
supervisors must be carefully screened to provide support personnel for student 
teachers as they try to implement the reform. Cooperating teachers and university 
supervisors who do not “buy in” to the reform can send conflicting messages which 
can undermine the student teachers’ progress. Such personnel also need to be trained 
to deal with student teachers’ problems and have time in their schedules to conference 
and work with the student teachers. 

3. A support structure for student teachers. Student teachers also need a support 
structure to help make the transition from traditional teaching strategies to the 
student-centered classrooms advocated by many educational reforms. The student 
teachers need to have a voice, put forth their ideas with other teachers commenting 
and making suggestions in a non-threatening manner. The student teacher should 
have an opportunity to try their ideas with other team members providing support. 
Support in this situation means giving praise when an action yields good results, 



ERIC 



173 



133 



making suggestions for improvement, and providing encouragement when something 



goes wrong. 

4. Student teacher subject matter preparation. Student teachers need to be adequately 
prepared for the subject matter they will be teaching. Schools of education need to 
look carefully at their particular subject matter requirements, analyzing the number of 
courses required and the content of these courses, and making changes if their 
requirements seem insufficient. Student teachers who must struggle with content 
have an extra burden as they endeavor to manage a classroom and deal with the many 
facets of student instruction and learning. 

5. Student Teacher pedagogical preparation. Aspiring teachers have spent a minimum 
of 1 2 years in the educational system acquiring a view of what they believe should be 
happening in the classroom. It is a challenge to teacher educators to dispel many 
misconceptions and replace them with a view of educational practice grounded in 
research. 

6. Integration and consistency of program. Today there are a number of different 
teacher education programs, each with its own underlying philosophy, values and 
benefits. In order for any teacher education program to be effective, the total teacher 
education program — classes, practicums, student teaching and other experiences — 
must be truly integrated, give aspiring teachers practical experience throughout the 
program, and be internally consistent. Conflicting messages can undermine an 
otherwise, good program and yield undesirable results. 



Learning to teach is a complex process. Many factors influence the future 



teacher. Although some are out of the control of teacher educators, the field 



ERIC 




174 



experience can be carefully constructed to reinforce beliefs about teaching and 
learning advocated in pre-service education courses. The alternative is for the 
field experience to undo any progress made in changing the attitudes of future 
teachers.

The purpose or objective of the study 

Science literacy/preparation for students at all levels of learning has been a topic of great 

concern in the education co mmuni ty for the past decade ( AAAS, Project 2061 & Benchmarks). 

The professional literature clearly notes a lack of science preparation and literacy for elementary 

teachers being prepared by universities. (NRC, 1996; Fort, 1993; Tobias, 1992 & 1990). 

Researchers suggest that the problem of science literacy, stemming from early years in 

schooling, is perpetuated in the current structure of the undergraduate introductory level science 

courses. They propose that negative or passive attitudes are rekindled and solidified and are 

subsequently passed on to the next generation of learners. The National Research Council’s 

(NRC) (1990) identified problems and needs are explained in Fulfilling the Promise: Biology 

Education in the Nation 's Schools. They state that: 

Teachers of science in elementary School must be far better prepared than are 
most at present. To disguise their anxieties about science, most elementary 
school science teachers have hidden behind textbook-centered lessons that stress 
vocabulary and memor izati on of facts. Given the minimal amount of science 
instruction taken in college by most elementary -school teachers, that attitude is 
understandable. But the situation must change to achieve quality science 
instruction in the elementary schools. . . (p.16). 

Preservice elementary teachers’ science preparation is described as inadequate, both in 
content and methodology of instruction (NRC, 1996, NRC, 1990; Tobias 1992). These studies 
attribute the lack of preparation to: 1) The structure of traditional introductory level content 
science and methods courses and 2) The prevailing attitude among most elementary education 



majors that science and math are difficult and uninteresting subjects. This study proposes that 
both preparation issues are interrelated and that the problem may be addressed by developing 
collaborative content science courses for preservice teachers between science departments and 
teacher colleges which integrate the methodologies and pedagogies currently advocated by 
national reform efforts in conjunction with the teaching and learning of content science. 

The purpose of this study was to explore science experiences and attitudes in a select 
group of preservice elementary education majors enrolled in an experimental introductory level 
content biology course offered through the department of life sciences, but jointly taught with 
instructors from both the Department of Life Sciences and the Teahcers College. Preliminary 
significant quantitative measures led to a qualitative case study methodology which produced a 
holistic picture of how a preservice elementary teacher experiences this course. Multiple case 
comparisons have led to the generation of a substantive theory of the progressional aspects or 
hurdles that elementary preservice teachers encounter, overcome, and achieve as they learn 
science in this alternative environment. 

Conceptual framework 

In the fall semester of 1993 a new^undergraduate content biology course for elementary 
education majors was designed; Biological Sciences 295 (Bio 295). 

Biology 295 (Hands-on Biology for Elementary Education Majors) is a course for 
elementary education majors designed to teach simultaneously biological concepts and pedagogy 
through the scientific process. This course is based upon the science literacy standards 
advocated by the National Research Council in the recently released National Science Education 
Standards (1996 and preceding draft editions), the American Association for Advancement in 
Science (AAAS) in Project 2061 (AAAS, 1989), Benchmarks (AAAS, 1994), National Science 



Teachers Association's (NSTA) Scope, Sequence & Coordination of Secondary School Science: 
Vol. I - Content Core: A Guideline for Curriculum Designers and Vol II - Relevant Research 
(1992), and Nebraska Department of Education's Math and Science Frameworks (1994). Also 
considered are the goals of the nation and the state as covered in Project 2000. 

The philosophy of the course is rooted in constructivism, thus emp h a si z i ng individual 
stud e nt s ’ background, culture, philosophies, and needs (Tobin, 1993; Cobem, 1989; Von 
Glasersfeld, 1989). The curriculum provides students with a knowledge base of biological 
concepts and integrates pedagogy traditionally taught in separate education classes. 

The knowledge base, as explored in the course, allows prospective teachers to do hands- 
on activities and to use discovery/inquiry types of instructional techniques which require a 
profound unders tanding of biological content. The curriculum aims to encourage preservice 
elementary education majors to integrate biological concepts more substantively into their 
teaching curriculum. 

The curriculum also provides for modes of alternative assessment which require students 
to demonstrate their ability and knowledge through performance related tasks. The course is 
designed to empower preservice elementary education majors to become agents of change, so 
that they in turn may empower their students to guide their own learning through the scientific 

process. 

Since the Spring term 1994 quantitative data have been collected on both content biology 
and attitude surveys. Content biology was measured by using a pre / post test design on the 
National Association of Biology Teachers (NABT) Biology Content Exam. In a previous study 
(Bruning & Glider; unpublished), thirty questions had been selected from the NABT exam and 
administered to general Biology 101 courses at UNL. This instrument was administered each 



semester to the Biology 295 students. Results from a pre / post two- tailed t test analysis show 
significant alpha values (<.05) for each semester demonstrating that studnets learned significant 

biology content during the semester. Results from the two sections of the Fall semes ter l 995 

are shown in (Appendix A: Table 1). Other semesters are not included in the table but had 
similar significance of <.001 . 

The Science Attitudes survey (Bruning, unpublished) is a survey which explores seven 
areas related to overall confidence and attitude. Areas examined are: A) Confidence in learning 
science as a student; B) Utility of science; C) Affect of science; D) Gender and ability to leant 
science; E) Constructivist learning and teaching in science; F) Confidence in teaching content 
science in the classroom and; G) Confidence in teaching science and sharing it in professional 
circles. The Science Attitudes survey has been administered each semester to the Biology 295 
students. Results from a pre / post two tailed t-test analysis show significant alpha values for 
each semester in each category. A comprehensive analysis of all the students thus far also 
showed significant alpha values for each component of the test. (Appendix A, Table 2) 

The pre liminar y quantitative findin gs proved encouraging and led to further questions 
about the course. Many studies concludewith the development, evaluation, significant 
quantitative findings, and resulting publicity. However, making a difference is only the 
beginning to unders tanding how and why these significant changes were brought about. 

Biology 295 is an unique bounded system and all of the above situations and recognitions 
provide a rationale to study the course qualitatively. Specifically, studying the experiences and 
attitudinal progression of preservice elementary education majors over the duration of the course 
could provide valuable information which may lead to the development of theories on how 
alternative science courses help students overcome barriers to learning and teaching science. 



This also addresses the national concern of science literacy for students on all levels and their 
respective teachers. 

Methodology: 

Having a quantitative basis to show that a significant event has taken place, qualitative 
analyses were required to explain the how and why changes occurred as a result of experiencing 
Biology 295. Therefore, the research for this study follows the qualitative paradigm and 
attempts to explain the significant quantitative findin gs while concurrently distilling patterns that 
emerge from the participants experiences thus leading to the generation of a substantive theory 
of learning science in an alternative setting. 

Merriam (1988) defined qualitative research and emphasized the need to explore 
subjective phenomenon: “((Qualitative research assumes that there are multiple realities - that 
the world is not an objective thing out there but a function of personal interaction and 
perception. It is a highly subjective phenomenon in need of interpreting rather than measuring” 
(P-17). 

Having multiple data sources, a context or bounded system, and a phenomenon to study 
led to a case study design. A Case study Is universally defined as, "(A) detailed examination of 
one setting, or a single subject, a single depository of documents, or one particular event” 
(Bogdan & Biklen, 1992, p.62). Merriam (1988) further clarified a case study as "an 
examination of a specific phenomenon such as a program, an event, a person, a process, an 
institution,. or a social group"(p.9). Case studies require that the subject or phenomenon being 
studied qualify as a bounded system. Merriam (1988) explains, "The bounded system, or case, 
mi ght be selected because it is an instance of some concern, issue or hypothesis" (p.10). 
Adelman, Jenkins and Kemmis (1983), simplify the explanation by stating, "The most straight 



forward examples of 'bounded systems' are those in which the boundaries have a common sense 
obviousness, e.g. an individual teacher, a single school, or perhaps an innovatory programme" 
(P-3). 

Additional exploration of case study designs revealed explanations of multiple case 
studies. Merriam (1988) explained that "the case study focuses on a single unit within there may 
be several examples, events, or situations (which) can be exemplified by numerous case studies" 
(p.46). Yin (1984) proposed that multi case studies try to "build a general explanation that fits 
each of the individual cases, even though the cases will vary in their details." (p.108). Miles & 
Huberman (1984) suggested that "by comparing sites or cases, one can establish the range of 
generality of a finding or explanation, and at the same time, pin down the conditions under 
which that finding will occur." (p. 151). 

Further study of Merriam (1988), Bogdan & Biklen (1992), and Denzin & Lincoln 
(1994), led to the realization that case studies often lend themselves to developing theory. 
Merriam (1988) explained that, "A qualitative inductive multi case study seeks to build 
abstractions across cases" (p.154). After clarifying the account of several case studies within 
the same context or bounded system, Merriam (1988) elaborated, "Anchored in real-life 
situations, the case study results in a rich and holistic account of the phenomenon. . . . case 
studies play an important role in advancing a field’s knowledge base" (p.32) and that "qualitative 
case study usually builds theory" (p.57). Stake (1994), suggested that a "Case study can usually 
be seen as a small step toward grand generalization" (p.238). Finally, Merriam (1988) stated 
that it is appropriate inductively to discover theory from case study research when there is no 
theory present which explains the phenomenon. She stated: 

The case study has been widely used, however, in the service of constructing 

theory. It becomes necessary to build theory when there is none available to 



explain a particular phenomenon or when existing theory does not provide an 
adequate or appropriate explanation. Eckestein (1975, p.104) calls theory 
building case studies "heuristic" because they "aim to find out." Case studies that 
are undertaken to build theory use an inductive rather than deductive mode of 
thinking about the problem and analyzing the data. These studies, which have as 
their goal dis covery of theory rather than verification, partake of the qual i tat i ve 
paradigm (p.59). 

The research within case study methodology is consistent in emp h a si z in g purposeful 

selection when selecting individuals as case studies in a bounded system. Memam (1988) 

defined and ratio naliz ed at the same time purposeful selection: 

(P)robabalistic sampling is not necessary or even justifiable in qualitative 
research. Anthropologists, for example, have long maintained that nonprobability 
sampling methods "are logical . . . ." (Honigmann, 1982, p.84). Thus the most 
appropriate sampling strategy is nonprobablistic - the common form of which is 
called purposive (Chein, 1981) or purposeful (Patton, 1980). Purposive sampling 
is based on the assumption that one wants to discover, understand, gain insight; 
therefore one needs to select a sample from which one can learn the most (pp. 47- 
48). 

U tilizing the methodology of purposeful selection, six preservice elementary education 
majors [here after referred to as students] were self selected from the Spring 1995 Biology 295 
class. The criteria for selection required students with different backgrounds in and 
understandings of science. Based upon the works of Tobias (1990) and Fort (1993) two 
students were selected from the First Tier (Tobias) or as Fort suggests, Science Smart. These 
students possessed a strong science content knowledge and had positive experience with the 
subject matter. Two students were selected from the Second Tier (Tobias) or as Fort suggests. 
Science Savvy. These students possessed the ability and confidence to learn science, but had 
little experience with the content. And, two students were selected from the Third Tier or 
majority (Tobias) or as Fort suggests, Science Shy. These students possessed ability to learn 
science, but had attitudes reflecting little or no confidence in learning science as a result of no 
experience with science or bad experiences previously encountered while learning science. 



Using purposeful selection of six participants enabled a multi case study design. Thick 
and rich descriptions were developed of each participant and their experiences and progression 
in attitude, confidence and philosophy as they experienced Biology 295. By using cross case 
analysis to look for co mm on strands and themes, a substantive theory was generated which 
explores the barriers and hurdles that preservice elementary education majors encounter and 
overcome in the progression of learning science in this alternative learning environment. This 
theory was based upon their experiences and attitudes resulting from participation in Biology 
295. 

The cross case analysis and the generation of the substantive theory were reviewed by an 
outside reviewer. The outside reviewer read each of the cases and then verified the cross case 
analysis with accompanying substantive theory as an accurate deduction from the data. Denzin 
& Lincoln (1994) state that an outside reviewer is an excellent way of keeping the research and 
theory in the proper context and thereby limiting researcher bias. Therefore, the results, both by 
individual cases and cross case comparison generate a fair interpretation and theory based upon 
the attitudes and experiences of these students as they experienced Biology 295. 

Nature of the Data — 

Major data sources for this study included transcripts from pre and post interviews with 
each participant, journals that each preservice elementary education major kept as a student 
involved with the Biology 295 course, and video taped segments of the different class sessions. 

The interviews with each of the participants were conducted at the beg inning of the 
course and at the end of the course. The final interview allowed the participants to share any 
further insight that they had relating to experiences and attitudes as a result of being in the 



course. The interviews were conducted in such a way that the participants felt comfortable to 
"talk freely about their points of view" (Bogdan & Biklen, p.97). 

Posner (1993) came up with a logical formula by which the journaling assignments were 
based upon: ( E + R = PG) "experience plus reflection equals personal growth." As part of the 
class stipulations, each student was required to keep a reflective journal of the labs, activities, 
and ev ents of the course in a two way dialogue format. Topics to reflect upon included specific 
lab activities and related scientific content, relating content to real life experiences, pedagogical 
strategies modeled or conveyed in class, classroom connections (projecting the usefulness of the 
content and course to their future classrooms), and their thoughts and feelings that they 
discovered as they participated in class. All of these journaling experiences were designed to 
further the students' unders tanding and learnin g as a part of their personal growth. Fulwiler 
(1980) summarized the importance of written documents as the "text content provides a window 
of understanding about how effectively people observe events, speculate, revise thinking, and 
reach conclusions." 

During the entire semester each lab was video taped. Approximately sixty hours of video 
tape were acc umulat ed from labs and corresponding activities. The video taping was conducted 
as a record of the labs and provided a visual component to the written responses that the 
participants made in their journals 

With the above data sources and participant observation records kept by the researcher, 
massive amounts of rich descriptive data were obtained. Using the qua lit a ti ve methodology as 
described above and following the advice of Bogdan & Biklen (1992) that "As you read through 
your data certain words, phrases, patterns of behavior, subjects' ways of think ing, and events 



O 

ERIC 



185 



repeat and stand out" (p.166), the thick and rich descriptions which were developed with each 
participant and their experiences led to the themes developed by each individual case. 

Further analysis incorporated Miles & Huberman (1994) suggested strategies forcross- 
case analysis. "A conceptual framework oversees the first case study, then successive cases are 
examined to see whether the new pattern matches the one found earlier" (p.436). Merriam 
(1988), suggested, "using an 'unordered meta-matrix’ - a large chart organized by variables of 
interest to the researchers that contains bits of narrative such as key phrases, quotes, or other 
illustrations of the category ... by doing this one can advance to higher levels of analysis." 
(P-155). 

The higher levels of analysis led to a substantive theory, "a theory restricted to a 
particular setting, group, time, population, or problem" (Merriam, 1988. p.57), which was based 
upon the multiple data sources and cross case comparisons. 

Findings and Results: Cross Case Analysis and Substantive Theory 

Science education and science instruction in the elementary school has been a topic of 
research for quite some time. In 1978 Weiss found that only 28% of elementary teachers felt 
qualified to teach science and that on thenverage 90 minutes per day were spent on reading 
instruction versus an average of 17 minutes on science instruction. These results have been 
corroborated by Stefanich and Kelsey (1989) who found that less time is spent on science 
instruction in elementary schools than any other subject. Of the time spent on science 
instruction, an earlier study found that 90% of the teachers relied on textbooks for about 90% of 
their science instruction (Stake and Easley, 1 978). Yager and Lutz (1 994) found similar results 
and further explained that science instruction was comprised of students listening to lectures, 
reading from textbooks, and memorizing, repeating and confirming scientific facts. More 



importantly, a study done by Roychoudhury, Tippins, & Scantlebury (1995) found that science 
instruction was generally not connected to students’ prior knowledge nor was it relevant to 

students’ everyday lives. _ 

Numerous studies have shown over time that the majority of preservice elementary 
education majors have negative attitudes toward science (Shrigley, 1974; Monisey, 1981; 
Westerback, 1982; Feistritzer & Boyer, 1983; Pedersen & McCurdy, 1992). Of considerable 
concern is that teachers with negative attitudes toward science can, through their own actions, 
pass this attitude on to students in their classes (Stolberg, 1969). Ramey-Gassert & Schroyer 
(1 992) have s ummar ized numerous studies concluding that elementary teachers poor self- 
efficacy has resulted in a science anxiety and that poor attitudes toward science result in an 
unwillingness or hesitancy to spend any tim e teaching science. Lucas & Dooley (1982) inferred 
that poor attitudes toward science can be traced back to the individual’s own experiences at 
school. This assumption was recently validated in a study where autobiographies of 56 
preservice elementary teachers were analyzed. The study concluded that “the dominion of 
text-based science education in the schooling of the preservice teachers and its negative 
association with experiences in science” was the leading cause of poor attitudes among the 
participants in the study (Talsma, 1996). 

As a result of such research regarding what is and what is not being taught in the schools 
and more specifically in the elementary classrooms, it is no wonder that the recent reform efforts 
are underway. The question now becomes whether the reform movements are having any 
impact on the way science instruction occurs in the content areas, in the teacher preparation 
programs, and in the public schools.

Science is a process of understanding and exploring the world in which we live. The 
recently released National Science Education Standards (NRC, 1996) advocate that “Learning 
science is something that students do, not something that is done to them” (p. 20). The 
standards also state that “since science content increases and changes, a teacher’s understanding 
in science must keep pace” (p.57). The National Standards go even further to suggest how 
teachers and prospective teachers should learn and keep pace with science: “Prospective and 
practicing teachers must take science courses in which they learn science through inquiry, having 
the same opportunities as their students will have to develop understanding” (p.60). 

The standards (NRC, 1996) employ science content as only one part of several facets of 
science instruction. The standards also equally encourage the process of doing science along 
with history, philosophy, technology, connections of unifying themes in science, and a personal 
and social perspective in science with the three basic content areas of life, physical and earth 
science. 

Biology 295, the focus of this research, has provided an experience for prospective 
teachers which allows them to leam science through situations and activities that are similar to 
the sit uat ions that elementary students will have in order to develop scientific understanding of 
both the content and process of science. The study conducted for this research has affirmed the 
findings of past researchers. Furthermore, this study has identified, through thorough analysis of 
the experiences of the six participants, some striking similarities regarding the hurdles and 
levels of l earning that participants experienced and overcame as they participated in Biology 



295. 



Each participant came into the course with different backgrounds and experiences in 
growing up and in l earnin g science. The in-depth case studies reveal similarities and differences

in the variety of learning situations of each of the participants throughout the Biology 295 course 
(Appendix A, Table 3). Each of the participants had learned biology and had kept a good record 
in their jou rnal of the concepts. Each of the participants made sense of the “new knowledge” 
through their prior experiences, whether it was growing up on a farm or relating it to activities 
and experiences encountered in formal and informal science learning situations. Each student 
haH a philosophical progression from which they began with an idea of how science could be 
taught atiH learned in their future classroom to a mature vision and plan of how they would teach 
science in their future classroom. However, probably the most significant similarity surfaced 
when all six cases were compared and the experiences thoroughly analyzed. 

Each of the participants went through five progressional stages as they experienced 
Biology 295. Upon further analysis, and based upon Merriam’s (1988) recommendation that 
case studies should lead to the generation of a theory, the following substantive theory holds for 
the six participants studied in depth and is thought to hold for the majority of students who 
experience Biology 295. 

The substantive theory suggested here states that preservice elementary education majors 
encounter five hurdles, or stages, as they experience Biology 295: 1) Reservations and 
hesitations or the anxiety stage, 2) Awareness / enjoyment stage, 3) Intrinsic shift, 4) Rapid 
building of self confidence and self efficacy, and 5) Empowerment. A holistic picture of the 
reflections encountered in each stage of the theory is depicted in Table 4 in Appendix A. (The 
dissertation describes, in great detail, each stage in a cross case comparison and grounds each 
stage of the theory in current research.)

Table four helps the reader see in a holistic manner the participants and their 
progressions. Upon further analysis it is interesting to explore the patterns which emerge from 
looking at the holistic table along with the different data sources. 

In stage one, hesitations and reservations (anxiety), each of the participants clearly stated 
their reservations in both the pre interview and again after the initial thirty minute introduction 
meeting on the first Monday lecture session. This only seems reasonable in that most students 
experience some reservation and anxiety before and on the first day of class. The anxiety, as 
stated previously, is usually due to the negative experiences that the preservice elementary 
teachers had priorly experienced in learning science in formal settings. It is interesting to note 
that the participants in this study had various experiences before entering the Biology 295 
course. 

Elly and Jenny both remembered positive science experiences in elementary school. 
Samantha, Elizabeth, and Natali all remembered elementary science as basically text book 
stuff’ and they all conveyed that “they really didn’t learn anything.” Maggie didn t recall any 
elementary science at all. None of the participants equated a real dislike for the text book stuff 
they experienced during the elementary years; however, the most enjoyable experiences related 
to the el ementar y years were invariably connected to activities where the students were actively 
engaged in what they were doing. Elly mentioned her outdoor leadership camp where she 
recalled many “science activities relating to nature.” Jenny mentioned her Saturday science 
camp at UNL where there were “tons of hands-on activities.” Natali only remembered a nature 
walk” with no details. It is also interesting to note that all the participants related their most 
negative experiences with science during their high school years. This also seems reasonable as

190 



the high school experiences, besides college science courses, were the most recent experiences 
in the participants memory. 

After overcoming the initial hurdle of the anxieties, the preservice teachers spent the 
majority of their time over the next few weeks of journal entries sharing their enjoyment and 
enthusiasm for learning science, in some cases for the very first time. During this second stage, 
there were numerous journal entries reflecting the awareness and especially the enjoyment of 
doing science. Table 4 only displays the most significant journal entries where awareness and 
enthusiasm were the primary focus of the reflection. The interesting pattern that emerges in this 
section is that there was a concentration of these journal entries which stayed consistent for 
about three weeks. The journal entries during this time displayed some interesting 
characteristics. The words fun, wow, big +, exciting, great, and I really liked, were written 
with expression. The words were usually capitalized and written in bright colors. In addition, 
many exclamation points were used to emphasize the enjoyment factor during this time. 

An interesting pattern that emerges here is that all of the participants experienced this 
enjoyment during the same period of time; however, Jenny was a late bloomer. Jenny was 
science smart and although she enjoyed the labs, her traditional experiences with science 
somehow seemed to dampen her initial ability to communicate her enthusiasm and enjoyment in 
her journal. Jenny’s reflections about the first few labs were quite rigid and explored only the 
content and processes that she learned in class. Although Jenny obviously enjoyed the initial 
labs as noticed from observations, she didn’t begin to communicate her enjoyment until about 
two weeks later than the rest. 




191 



211 



Journal entries from all of the participants continued to mention the enjoyment of doing 
science throughout the entire semester; however, enjoyment and “fun” were no longer the 
primary focus issue in the reflections after this time. 

Stage three or the intrinsic shift was usually a result of the enjoyment combined with the 
accumulating confidence and realization that the activities done in Biology 295 were actual 
activities that could be done in the elementary classroom. There came a time when the learning 
was no longer for the teacher, but for the individual and her future classroom. This shift came at 
appro ximat ely the same time for each of the participants and centered around three events in the 
class (These events were discussed in detail earlier). The first event consisted of the assigned 
readings that the students were to read and reflect upon. The second was the Elodea lab where a 
prolonged amount of tim e was allotted for the study of photosynthesis in the aquatic plant. The 
third event was the midterm science fair project/presentation which resulted in a self reflection 
of the assi gnm ent and overall progress in the course up to that time. 

The articles allow the students to think seriously about the philosophy toward the 
teaching and learning of science that they have been experiencing in Biology 295. The 
photosynthesis and Elodea help the students to realize that they must do their part in lea rni n g and 
not accepting just the “easy answer ” Finally, the science fair project allows the students to take 
both the philosophy and knowledge of learning up to that time and express it in their own 
experiment. In combination with the enjoyment of science and this application of science that is 
very personalized, but designed for success, the preservice teachers make the transition from 
extrinsic motivation to being intrinsically motivated to learn and to do quality work as it has a 
purpose for their future careers. 




192 



212 



Once the intrinsic shift has taken place the fourth stage of rapid growth of self- 
confidence and self-efficacy takes place. The participants have been developing confidence and 
efficacy in their abilities both in learning and teaching science since the beginning of the course. 
However, like stage two, there seemed to be a concentration of reflections ranging from just 
after midterm to the last week or so in class that focused on confidence and efficacy. In each of 
the participants reflections there were numerous statements of how for the first time they had 
“really understood” a topic or concept and that with this understanding they could really “teach 
it for the first time.” Table 4 only shows the most significant reflections for each of the 
participants in this area. Str ikin gly, the majority of the reflections appear with the onset of the 
cell biology unit. 

In Biology 295 the emphasis is not on the terminology, but rather the process by which 
things do what they do. The students identify with both the process and the philosophy and feel 
confidence in learning about abstract processes which for many is the first time that any of the 
processes and terminology has made any sense. Each of the participants wrote reflections 
co mmuni cating this confidence regarding the methodology used to teach about cells. Elly, 
science savvy, wrote, “In less than one hour on a Thursday night in Henzlik, I suddenly 
UNDERSTOOD AND APPRECIATED material that had definitely been offered to me before.” 
S amantha, science smart wrote, “This lab has been so rewarding to me because I have learned 
more on the cell, how it works, organelles of it and what it effects, than I have ever learned in 
high school or college until now.” Maggie, science shy, wrote, “I really learned a lot about the 
cell. I was able to realize the individual parts of the cell, the way it runs (or lives) and the 
function of each part. Doing a lesson lik e this enables ease in understanding and ret ainin g more 
from the activity.” Jenny, Science smart, wrote, “For the first time EVER I am beg innin g to 



understand the cell. It was always handed to me before and I was expected to know it - now I 
can actually begin to understand because I have something to connect it to!” Elizabeth, science 
shy, wrote, “This was a great connection! I was able to understand what a cell does. Weknew 
what a city looked like, a vision and we knew the functions each part played. . . .There was so 
much that I learned through acting out the parts of the cell.” Natali, science savvy, wrote, 
“Tonite I learned so much about how a cell is comprised. . . I will probably never forget IP on 
MAT [stages of mitosis] after decorating the cookies.” 

The reflections to the cell biology lab are only a few relating the confidence and learning 
that took place during the unit. The gain in confidence and efficacy about teaching and learning 
science peaked at the end of the semester and resulting in a new stage. 

Stage five is the empowerment stage. The participants in this study have progressed 
through the stages of anxiety, awareness and enjoyment, intrinsic motivation, and rapid growth 
in self-confidence and self-efficacy, all of which are part of the definition of empowerment. The 
empowerment stage in Biology 295 is a stage where the preservice elementary education majors 
have rather full confidence in themselves and their abilities to actually teach science in their 
future classrooms. All of the students conveyed their at tainm ent of this stage usually in their 
final journal reflection and then again in the final interview. 

The participants explained how they were able to take the lessons to their practicums or 
other learning environments with children, modify the activity so that it was appropriate for the 
students in their given situations, teach the concept in a hands-on inquiry manner, and watch the 
whole process of learning and enjoyment of doing science begin in the eyes of their students. 
The feeling of being enabled to do science truly becomes empowerment as the preservice 
teachers teach with confidence and passion and then pass it on to their students. It is interesting 



to note that the practicum alignment with the Biology 295 course was incidental, but proved to 
be the major key to the empowerment stage. This only adds to the validity of the argument that 
you really don’t learn or know something until you have to teach it. 

Conclusions 

In essence, Biology 295 creates an atmosphere for learning science where preservice 
teachers can capi taliz e! upon their given strengths and leant science in such a way that the 
preservice teachers then become advocates of science in the schools, a process that probably 
wouldn’t have happened had these preservice teachers taken the “science for the masses” courses 
where the negative and stereotypical view of teaching and learning science prevail. 

Piel and Green (1 992) have reported that due to the recent emphasis to improve 
preservice elementary education majors’ science understandings many universities are simply 
requiring more science courses as prerequisite to entering the professional sequences. In the 
same study Piel and Green (1992) came to the conclusion that “in spite of highly visible 
recommendations for more extensive academic course work, results indicate the impracticality 
of addressing teacher competence through added course work before appropriate attitude 
adjustment processes have been planned or implemented.” The same conclusion was made by 
Talsma (1996) in her recent study of preservice teachers. 

It is important for teacher preparation institutions to recognize that by the time preservice 
elementary education majors take their science methods course (s) their previous attitudes 
whether negative or indifferent have been reinforced by the traditional college courses which 
they have already taken. It is no wonder that so much time in methods courses must be spent 
initiall y in convincing the preservice teachers that science is intrinsically interesting. 



Based upon the findin gs presented in this study and related theory of prospective 
elementary teacher’s progression in Biology 295 from anxiety to empowerment in the teaching 
of science there is no longer any valid justification in assigning “just more content courses^” If 
preservice elementary education majors are to leam science and become science advocates in 
their fixture schools, they must first leam to enjoy science and become more confident in their 
ability to teach science. Thus, one could reasonably conclude that courses should be developed 
in collaboration with the content areas which replace the general education requirements and yet 
teach content and pedagogy to these future teachers simultaneously. 

This study demonstrates a successful alternative in the learning of content science. 
Biology 295 has allowed for content and process to be taught simultaneously in a learning 
environment which enhances preservice teacher’s attitudes toward science. This study has 
theorized the hurdles that preservice teachers overcome in learning content science in order to 
achieve a positive attitude and confidence toward the subject. This will empower them to teach 
science in a positive and exciting way so that their future students will not have to overcome the 
traditional fears and views of science that their teachers may have passed on or may have 
encountered learning science in a more traditional environment. 

Hands-on “type” classes are emerging in colleges and universities across the nation. 
Numerous funding sources advocate and finance the development of such courses and programs. 
In a recent study, Wylo (1993) followed recent graduates of elementary education who had 
experienced a course similar to Biology 295 into their first career teaching assignments. Wylo 
found that in all of the 38 students surveyed “the positive attitudes acquired in the program 
persisted over time.”

Further research in the validation of the hurdles in learning that preservice elementary 
education majors encounter as they study science in alternative science courses as well as the 
long term effects j)f such courses on professional practice seems to be relevant. Although one 
study has shown that science instruction improves in the field with such a course, further 
research and replication studies should be done to explore the long term effects of such theories 
and programs in practice both inside and outside of the science education co mm u ni ty .

TRANSLATING CURRENT SCIENCE EDUCATION REFORM EFFORTS 
INTO CLASSROOM PRACTICES 

Farella L. Shaka, Southwest Missouri State University 



Introduction 



In the mid-1980s, for a second time in this century, a crisis was declared in science 
education. It became apparent from reports based on national assessments of science that there 
was a major problem in science education in elementary and secondary schools (e.g., Boyer, 1983; 
National Commission on Excellence in Education (NCEE), 1983). Several studies revealed that 
there was a decline in achievement and interest in science, and in the understanding of basic science 
concepts (National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), 1983, Hueftle, Rakow, & 
Welch, 1983; Weiss, 1987). Most high school graduates and even college students could not 
apply their science knowledge to real life situations (Champagne & Klopfer, 1984; Yager & 

Penick, 1987). Further, reports on international comparisons of student assessments also revealed 
that American students did not measure up to students in other developed countries in science and 
mathematics (International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement, 1988; Klein 
& Rutherford, 1985; Lapointe et.al., 1989). The problem was not limited to science education 
alone; the 1983 NCEE report painted a grim picture of the state of education in the nation. In some 
cases, the problems in education were linked to a corresponding decline in America's leadership 
position in economics, and scientific and technological advances (e.g., Center for the Assessment 
of Educational Progress, Educational Testing Service, 1987). The educational system was failing 
in its task of preparing students for responsible citizenship and productive employment. There was 
a national outcry for educational reform and for reform in science, mathematics and technology 
education. 

In response to the nations' call for action the American Association for the Advancement of 
Science initiated a comprehensive long-term reform effort, Project 2061. This project proposed a 




207 227 



fundamental reform of science education focused on achieving scientific literacy for all Americans. 
The efforts made by AAAS produced two documents, Science for All Americans and Benchmarks 
for Scientific Literacy which are now being used widely by various groups working on science 
reform at state and national levels. 

Today, science, mathematics, and technology education are deemed as very important 
disciplines in American education. These disciplines are now seen as important for all citizens to 
participate effectively in a highly scientific and technological society. Thus, a major goal of science 
education today is science literacy for all Americans. In an effort to achieve this goal, large 
amounts of financial and human resources are being used all over the nation to restructure, and 
redesign K-12 science education. New programs are being designed and implemented at the 
elementary, middle school, and high school levels. 

Following the publication of Science for All Americans, which defined scientific literacy, 
the National Research Council coordinated the development of national science education 
standards. The National Science Education Standards describes what students should understand 
and be able to do at different grade levels and in various branches of science. The Benchmarks for 
Scientific Literacy and the National Science Education Standards now serve as blueprints based on 
which individual states are developing their science education standards. 

The Outstanding Schools Act (Senate Bill 380) is the spring board from which reform 
efforts were launched in Missouri. Senate Bill 380 was passed into law by Missouri Legislature in 
1993. Among several new programs and policies the law called for the establishment of academic 
performance standards that all students should obtain before graduating from high school. The 
standards would then serve as a basis for a revised statewide testing program and a guide for 
school curriculum. Within the context of this law reform in science education was initiated and 
new science standards and curriculum frameworks are being developed. 

As stated in the National Science Education Standards, "the real journey of educational 
reform and the consequent improvement of scientific literacy begins with the implementation of 
these standards" (p. 243). Defining scientific literacy and mapping out what it means to be 





scientifically literate are only the beginning of a long journey through the reform process. The 
most difficult task in an education reform effort of this nature is implementation. First, there is an 
urgent need to provide professional development experiences for teachers that will enable them to 
implement the new standards. Second, teacher education institutions need to provide learning 
experiences within their programs that will effectively prepare beginning teachers to implement the 
new standards. The project described in this paper focuses on the former. 

Description of the Project 

This is a first year report of a teacher enhancement project at Southwest Missouri State 
University funded by Missouri's Higher Education Eisenhower Grant Program. The purpose of 
the project was to provide professional development experiences for teachers that will enable them 
to implement the new national and state standards.. The goals of the project were: 

1. To provide teachers with a vision of the science teaching and learning standards contained in the 

Benchmarks for Scientific Literacy, National Science Education Standards, and Missouri 

Academic Performance Standards for K-12. 

2. To provide teachers with knowledge and skills that would enable them to implement the 

standards described in these documents. 

The project consisted of five weekend workshops scheduled during the 1995/96 academic 
year. Each workshop lasted for a whole day on Friday and half a day on Saturday. In these 
workshops, information about the content of the reform documents was provided and teachers 
were engaged in hands-on activities, inquiry, discussion, and development of curricula materials. 
The workshops were spread out through the year to give teachers enough time to reflect on new 
knowledge, practice new skills and try out new ideas. 

Participants received a total of 60 hours of instruction. Graduate credit was made available 
to teachers who opted to participate in the project for credit. The project director, who is a science 



educator in the Physics Department and a science educator in the Biology Department, were 
responsible for the instruction, supervision, and mentoring in the project. 

The target group was grades 4-8 teachers in rural schools. Rural teachers were targeted 
because they typically do not have the financial or human resources to embark on large scale 
reform efforts. Teachers were recruited from the southwestern region of Missouri through a 
variety of recruitment procedures. Thirty teachers were recruited. However, six teachers dropped 
off after the first or second workshop due to health problems, family problems, and/or pressure of 
work at school. Thus, 24 teachers completed the project. The teachers were from 13 school 
districts and one private school. There were 15 elementary teachers, eight middle school teachers, 
and one secondary level teacher. The elementary grade teachers were in self contained classrooms 
but the others were not. The group consisted of 21 females and three males. 

Overview of Project Activities 

The topics covered in the workshops were selected based on the science content standards, 
science teaching standards, assessment standards, and science program standards described in the 
National Science Education Standards. Participants prepared, taught, self evaluated, and revised 
sample lessons, units, and modules throughout the project. At the end of each workshop the 
participants were given assignments which focused on encouraging them to implement the 
knowledge and skills learned at that workshop. 

First Workshop - September. 1995 - 

At the first workshop, teachers were provided with information about the Benchmarks for 
Scientific Literacy, National Science Education Standards, and the Missouri Academic 
Performance Standards. They worked in grade level teams in discussing the similarities and 
differences between the content standards and their current science curriculum and identified topics 
and skills that were not being addressed in their classes. Information was presented on meaningful 
versus rote learning and constructivism. Different teaching methods were discussed including 
strategies and techniques that enhance learning. The Learning Cycle was modeled and the 
participants analyzed, discussed and critiqued the lesson. Finally they worked in collaborative 



ERIC 




groups in developing ideas for a grade level appropriate learning cycle lesson. Each participant had 
to teach and self evaluate at least one learning cycle lesson in his/her classroom before the next 
workshop. 

The workshop ended with a brief a presentation on the philosophy, methods, and typical examples 
of action research. The purpose was to provide participants with some background knowledge that 
will enable them to identify possible topics for investigation in their classroom or school. 

Second Workshop - November. 1995 

At the beginning of the second workshop, teachers were given an opportunity to share their 
experiences in teaching the learning cycle lesson. Then a discussion was generated on possible 
action research topics and questions related to methodology were discussed. Other topics 
addressed in the workshop were journaling and concept mapping. Participants were taught how to 
draw concept maps and how to teach concept mapping to students. At the end of the workshop, 
the participants were asked to introduce journaling and concept mapping in their classes and to 
report on their experiences at the next workshop. The issue of diversity in the classroom was also 
addressed in the second workshop. Information on the varieties of learning and teaching styles 
and The 4-MAT System were presented. Techniques for teaching science to students with special 
needs were also discussed. 

The next day, inquiry teaching was modeled and participants experienced what is involved 
in inquiry teaching and learning. The participants then developed inquiry lessons which they 
taught and self evaluated when they returned to their classrooms. 

Third Workshop - January. 1996 

The focus on the first day of the third workshop was on problem solving, critical thinking, 
and integration. Teachers participated in hands-on problem solving activities which enabled them 
to understand the differences between a science experiment and a problem solving activity. 
Different types of problem solving activities and how they can be used in the classroom were 
presented. Integration of the sciences and integration of science with other subjects was discussed 
Again, teachers participated in hands-on activities that demonstrated integration. Some of the 



ERIC 




211 



activities were done outdoors to show how the outdoors can be used as a science classroom. 
Following the presentations, participants worked collaboratively in developing grade level 
appropriate integrated thematic units. 

The focus of the Saturday morning session was on assessment. Different assessment 
strategies were presented. Participants worked on a hands-on activity which involved the 
development of a rubric. Following the presentation the participants worked collaboratively in 
developing assessment tasks for the unit that was developed the previous day. The assignment at 
the end of the workshop was for the participants to teach and self evaluate the thematic unit that 
was developed including all of the assessment procedures that were designed. 

Fourth Workshop - March. 1996 

The Friday morning session of the fourth workshop was used to reinforce, extend, and 
apply the knowledge and skills that were taught during the first three workshops. The workshop 
started with feedback from the participants on the thematic unit. Difficulties and problems were 
addressed and possible solutions were discussed. Using concept maps obtained from the students 
of one of the participants, techniques for scoring concept maps were discussed. Participants 
practiced scoring the maps and issues arising from the scoring techniques were discussed. The 
topic of diversity was visited again but the focus in that workshop was on strategies for developing 
interest of girls and minorities in science. Later that afternoon the group was taken on a field trip to 
a school where a middle school science teaeher demonstrated some of the ways in which 
technology can be used effectively in the science classroom. The Saturday session was devoted to 
the development of a teaching module that incorporated all of the science teaching methods, 
techniques, and strategies that were presented in the workshops. They also had to align and cross 
reference the topics chosen with the Benchmarks and the national and state standards. Participants 
were required to teach and self evaluate some of the lessons in the module before the fifth 
workshop. 

Fifth workshop - Mav. 1996 




212 232 



At the beginning of the workshop, participants reported on the lessons that were taught 
from the module. A lot of feedback and discussion was generated as participants reported on their 
experiences. Later a model for science curriculum development was presented based on the skills 
that the participants had developed throughout the workshops. They then worked in collaborative 
groups in planning a science curriculum framework based on science teaching modules. The 
instructors worked with the groups to ensure that the content was aligned with the standards and 
that the new methods, skills, and techniques learned in the workshops were included in the plans. 

The next day, each participant gave a report on the action research project that they 
embarked on during the year. Then, each grade level team presented their curriculum framework 
plan and the participants talked about how this experience would be used to enhance the curriculum 
planning and development in their school or district. 

Between March and May 1996, each participant was observed while teaching a science 
class by one of the two project instructors. Time was scheduled before or after the class for 
discussion with the teacher. Issues related to the implementation of the new ideas were discussed. 
After observing the class the teacher was also provided with feedback that highlighted the strengths 
and included recommendations for improving the weaknesses. 

Evaluation Procedure 

A variety of assessment and evaluation procedures were used. The evaluation procedures 
were comprised of: 1) the use of surveys that were administered at the beginning and the end of 
each workshop and others that were administered at the beginning and end of the project, 2) 
classroom observations, 3) interviews and conversations with teachers, 4) journals, and 5) 
continuous assessment of products of group and individual tasks throughout the workshops. Ten 
questions were generated. The questions that were addressed and the procedure(s) used for 
collecting information are included in the next section. The data collected was analyzed to generate 
some answers to the questions. The results are discussed with reference to each of the questions.

All of the comparisons were significant at the 0.001 level. Thus, there was a statistically 
significant increase in participants, knowledge of the Benchmarks, the National Standards, and the 
Missouri Standards. 

Question 2 

What changes do teachers experience in their attitudes to teaching science? 

A survey was used to collect information on teachers' views about science teaching before starting 
the project and at the end of the project. A 0-10 scale was used on the survey. The higher the 
number the better the attitude it represented. The results are reported in Table 3.

The computed t- value was significant at the 0.01 level. Therefore, there was a significant positive 
change in teachers' views about science teaching. 

Question 3-4 

Questions 3 & 4 were evaluated qualitatively through observations and informal conversations. 

Do science teaching attitudes correlate with practices in the science classroom? 

Are teachers implementing new classroom practices in their classrooms? 

Observations revealed that about seventy percent of the teachers were very open and 
receptive to the new ideas. They made every effort to try out the new techniques and methods in 
their classrooms. In several cases they did more than what was required in the project. A few 
teachers were rather skeptical about whether some of the new ideas will make a difference with 
regard to students learning. The teachers that were more open to change implemented more of the 
new ideas and provided lots of feedback and generated discussions based on their experiences. 




21 535 



The more skeptical teachers implemented the ideas with some anxiety and were not confident in 
using the skills or methods. However, when they did they were surprised at the response of the 
students. They reported that students reacted positively to the lessons. 

The project was designed in such a manner that teachers were forced to try out new skills 
and strategies after learning them. All of the teachers experienced some change as they 
implemented the ideas. Teachers that had a more positive attitude towards reform in science 
education implemented the new ideas more frequently. 

Question 5-7 

Data from the pre and post survey was analyzed to provide answers to questions 5 through 
7. Table 4 contains the results of the analyses. 

Are teachers engaging students in constructing scientific concepts? 

Are teachers engaging students in problem solving and critical thinking activities? 

Are teachers implementing alternative assessment procedures? 

The results show that there were significant changes in teachers' use of constructivist practices in 
their classrooms. There were also significant changes in teachers' use of problem solving and 
alternative assessment strategies.

Data from pre and post workshop surveys provided some information about changes in 
teachers' knowledge about these teaching strategies. Results obtained from pre and post workshop 
surveys on teachers’ knowledge about constructivism, problem solving, and critical thinking, and 
alternative assessment are reported in Table 5. 

The results in Table 5 show that there was significant increase in teachers' knowledge about these 
methods and techniques. The increase in knowledge must have resulted in the increased use of 
these strategies in the classroom. 

Question 8-10 

Questions 8, 9, and 10 were evaluated using information obtained from classroom 
observations, teachers' journals, and informal interviews. 

What are teachers' views about the networking mechanism established in this project? 

Teachers were very receptive to the networking mechanism that was set up through the 
project. They constantly commented on the opportunity that the project created for the exchange of 
ideas among the participants and between the participants and instructors. The relationships that 
were established will last long after the end of the project. Teachers are still keeping in touch with 
the instructors and seeking help in a variety of ways. A name and address list was distributed at 
the end of the project to encourage participants to keep in touch with each other. 



To what extent are teachers using research and other strategies to reflect on and generate 
knowledge about the teaching and learning process in their classrooms? 

Each participant embarked upon an action research project. The degree of involvement in 
the research project varied from one participant to another. However, even those that did very 
Small projects reported on insight that they gained from the problem that they studied. After the 
first experience some say they now feel more comfortable to engage in other research studies. 
Some teachers are currently involved in ongoing projects that may continue for another year or so. 

To what extent are teachers able to apply the knowledge, skills, techniques, and strategies 
learned in the workshops? 

All of the evidence obtained from the various evaluation methods indicate that teachers have 
been making every effort to implement the knowledge, skills, techniques, and strategies that they 
learned in the workshops. It was not expected that 100% of the participants will implement 100% 
of the ideas. However, enough of the knowledge and skills has and will continue to be 
implemented for one to say that change has been effected. 

Some teachers are already leading reform efforts in their schools and districts. They are 
giving presentations, planning workshops, and leading curriculum development efforts in their 
school districts. About six of the participants will return as lead teachers to participate as co- 
presenters and facilitators in the project this year. 

Conclusion 

Experiences from this project reveal that teacher change occurs when teachers first of all see 
the need for a reform, and then acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to bring about a change 
in their attitudes, teaching philosophies and teaching practices. Teachers in the project became 
familiar with the teaching and learning standards described in the reform documents and as they 
reflected on their science teaching and science programs with reference to these standards they saw 
the need for change. The project provided them with various experiences through which they 



acquired the knowledge and skills that enabled them to make changes in their teaching practices. 
Some of the teachers have emerged from the experience as change agents and are currently 
initiating reform efforts in their schools and/or districts. Thus, the project was quite successful in 
taking the current reform in science education into the classroom in its first phase of 
implementation. Change in education does not occur overnight, it is usually a slow process. It 
may take a decade or more for the full effects of some of the current efforts to be realized. As the 
project continues, the long term effects of the project on the participants will be studied over the 
next few years.

VALUES, DISSECTION, AND SCHOOL SCIENCE: 

AN INQUIRY INTO STUDENTS’ CONSTRUCTION OF MEANING

Rationale 

Facilitating the development of scientific literacy in students has been identified as one of 
the most important tasks facing science educators today (American Association for the 
Advancement of Science, 1993; 1989; National Science Teachers Association, 1992). An 
understanding of the nature of science is regarded as one of the defining characteristics of scientific 
literacy (National Research Council, 1996; American Association for the Advancement of Science, 
1993 ; National Science Teachers Association, 1992; Lederman & Zeidler, 1987; Showalter, 1968). 
Moreover, the importance of a philosophical view of the nature of science has had a presence in the 
science education community since the writing of Kuhn (1962), Schwab (1962) and Rutherford 
(1964) over thirty years ago. In its current incarnation, the "nature of science" has come to 
emphasize scientific inquiry as a human endeavor which is uncompromisingly bound to personal 
values and assumptions (Lederman, 1992). 

Though the discipline of science education embraces the notion that human values are 
inherent in the enterprise of science, translating this ideology into the practice of teaching is a 
somewhat more problematic issue. Roth (1992) and Tobin (1991) suggest that the epistemology 
underlying most traditional practice in science classrooms is objectivism, which manifests itself in 
the teaching of science as a body of objective facts. Teaching science from this objectivist stance 
contradicts the philosophical basis of the nature of science. 

Tobin, Tippins, and Hook (1992) contend that despite the adoption of perspectives 
consistent with the nature of science, many studies fail to account for the contribution of social and 
cultural factors in determining the negotiated meanings between the stakeholders in the classroom. 



purpose of this study is to identify and explore the intersection of students’ values and those inherent 
in the activity of dissection. 



Values, along with attitudes, beliefs, opinions, interests and motivation are among the 
components that constitute the affective domain (Simpson, Koballa, Oliver & Crawley, 1994). The 
generative role of values in the formation of more specific attitudes and beliefs emphasizes its 
significance both among the components of the affective domain and in the study (Rokeach, 1973). 

Values can be distinguished from attitudes and beliefs. An attitude is an evaluation of some 
object about which an individual has some knowledge (Pratkanis, Breckler, & Greenwald, 1988). 
Attitude reflects one's disposition toward an idea. This construct represents a favorable or 
unfavorable feeling toward something (Koballa, 1989). Beliefs form the cognitive basis for attitudes 
and are situated among more informational and factual components of thought. 

Definitions of values are vary widely in their specificity and content. For example, Kilby 
( 1993) defines a value as anything of importance to a person. However, Rokeach ( 1973) defines a 
value as an enduring belief that a specific mode of conduct (honesty) or end-state of existence 
(success) is personally or socially preferable to an opposite or converse mode of conduct or end-state 
of existence. 

Values are described as broad, abstract goals that lack a specific object (like attitudes) or 
reference point. Bravery, beauty, freedom, and practicality are values. They serve as dimensions of 
judgment or as abstract standards for decision making, through which an individual may develop 
specific attitudes and beliefs (Rokeach, 1973). 

For example, if beauty is a primary value for a particular individual, many of his attitudes and 
beliefs may be based on judgments as to whether a particular object is beautiful. The value of 
practicality may be more important to another individual, and many of her beliefs and attitudes may 
be based on judgments as to whether a particular object is practical. With this in mind, the two 
individuals’ attitudes and beliefs regarding a particular object may differ sharply. The term values has

come to mean the principles, ideals, and desire that constitute the basic motivational structure of a 
person or culture (Winner, 1986). 

The study of values is complicated by their tacit nature. Accordingly, direct inquiry into an 
individual's value systems is not likely to be fruitful. For example, if an interviewer posed the 
question, "What are your values?" it is probable that any given respondent would be able to think of 
very few, and these would likely be restricted to moral values. Even though each individual 
possesses many values, they are expressed contextually— through life experiences rather than in 
conscious thought. Because of the implicit nature of values, they are not readily accessible to the 
conscious awareness, and as such they cannot be measured directly. However, because values are 
expressed through our thoughts, behaviors, attitudes, etc. they are readily accessible through 
interpretive methodology. 

A working understanding of the role of value systems in shaping attitudes, feelings, and 
behaviors is critical to the interpretation of the data. Williams ( 1968) describes the nature of value 
systems in the following: 

...[perceptions] are steered by multiple and changing clusters of values. After a value 
is learned it becomes integrated somehow into an organized system of values wherein each value is 
ordered in priority with respect to other values. Variations in personal, societal, and cultural 
experience generate individual differences in value systems (p. 287) 

According to Williams, values are arranged into hierarchical clusters, which are determined 
and organized by socio-cultural factors. These clusters of values, or "value systems" function in 
such a manner that at any particular time, a single value or set of values has priority status in 
influencing an individual's attitudes and behaviors. However, the priority status of a value is 
contingent upon the particular phenomenon or context in which the phenomenon occurs. Changes in 
phenomena and shifts in context may cause a predominant value to shift in priority, wherein it is 
superseded by a different value or set of values. 

An individual's predominant values are highly influential in determining his or her perception 
of a particular phenomenon. In this context, "perception" is offered as a simplified descriptor of the 




224 244 



"meaning assigned to" a phenomenon. Quintas (1989) describes the essence of meaning in the 
following way: 

The scope of the term "meaning" is far wider than that of "significance." An action may entail 
very precise and even outstanding significance and still not have meaning because it is not integrated 
within an overall value horizon. Action endowed with significance may acquire positive or negative 
meanings in different contexts (p. 85). 

In other words, phenomena are assigned meaning through the organizational scheme that 
characterizes the individual's system of values and according to the context in which they occur. 
Much of the study data is interpreted according to this working framework of values, value systems, 
and perceptions. 

Purpose 

This study represents an investigation of the values embedded in the activity of dissection and 
how those values relate to the personal values of individual students. Additionally, the study 
explores the implications of this value relationship in students' assignment of meaning to the science 
they learn in high school. By emphasizing the relationship of these two independently constructed 
value systems, the research focuses on the human connection between science and science learning. 
The research questions guiding the study were: 1. What major factors in the life experiences of the 
students (gender, religion, past experience) contribute to the development of their value systems 
related to the dissection experience; and 2. How do the students' personal values compare and 
contrast with those found in the secondary science curriculum? We hope that developing a richer 
understanding of this value-centered relationship will help promote the teaching and learning 
associated with the activity of dissection into a more positively meaningful experience for all. 

Conceptual Framework 

Critical theory (Apple, 1979; Giroux, 1983), social constructivism (vonGlasersfeld, 1987), 
and world view theory (Cobem, 1991) together constitute the theoretical foundation of this 
endeavor. By recognizing these particular frameworks, I identify the lenses through which I view, 
collect and interpret data. These frameworks provide the focus and direction of the study. The use of 



multiple frameworks reflects an agreement with Denzin (1978) who advocates a triangulation of 
theoretical frameworks as a method of cross-verifying the perspective of the researcher. 

It is useful to think of critical theory as a unifying perspective which is grounded in the social 
constructivist framework and elaborated upon by the world view framework. Critical theory rejects 
the idea of an isolated, objective reality and advances a conception of reality that is collaboratively 
constructed in concert with socio-historical influences (Gallagher, 1993). Generally speaking, social 
constructivism is defined as a theory of knowledge that emphasizes the personal and individual 
construction of understanding based on social experiences. This concept of social knowledge 
establishes an epistemological foundation from which critical theory may proceed. Simply stated, 
constructivism describes understanding as a highly social process, and critical theory provides the 
means by which individuals can pursue this personal understanding by exploring its social and 
historical derivation. World view theory serves to sharpen the focus of the conceptual frame by 
highlighting the significance of the specific socio-cultural elements embedded in the dissection 
experience. 

Cobem (1991) has defined world view as a culturally-dependent, implicit, fundamental 
organization of the mind, composed of presuppositions or assumptions which predispose one to 
feel, think, and act in predictable patterns. The formation of world view begins in childhood, and 
through the myriad of interactions with the physical and social environment, world view 
presuppositions are unconsciously constructed. The world view of any given culture is invisible. 



existing almost exclusively in the subconscious of its members. Over 30 years ago, Hall ( 1959) 
wrote that "Honest and sincere men in the field [of sociology] continue to fail to grasp the true 
significance of the fact that culture controls us in deep and persisting ways, many of which are 
outside of awareness and therefore beyond.conscious control.” 

Skow, Samovar, & Heilweg (1990) emphasize that the world view of an individual becomes 
particularly influential when issues such as religion, death and suffering, humans’ place in nature, 
and other questions of "being" are considered. As these “critical” issues correspond so closely with

those embedded in the conflict surrounding the activity of dissection, world view theory provides 

Methods 

The study site is a tenth grade biology classroom in a high school located in the rural 
southeastern United States. The school has approximately 600 students in grades nine through 
twelve. The instructor of the course, Mr. Bradley is an experienced teacher who frequently uses 
animal dissection as a method of instruction. Participants in the study are comprised of the 85 
students in his enrolled in Mr. Bradley’s basic and intermediate biology courses. A purposeful 
sampling strategy was employed in order to select key participants that were most likely to provide 
the richest information for the study. During the initial stage of the study, students were informally 
engaged in conversation during laboratory activities. These conversations generated information 
regarding students' attitudes and beliefs about dissection as well as their individual levels of 
reflectiveness. Seventeen students were selected to participate in first round interviews. Students 
were selected for interviews according to their willingness to participate and their level of 
reflectiveness. Students participating in each round of interviews represented a balance of positive, 
neutral, and negative attitudes towards dissection. From this initial group of 17 students, eight were 
selected for more in-depth follow-up interviews. Four of these students also chose to participate in 
the third and final round of interviews. 

The data collection methods chosen for the study were participant observation, in-depth 
student interviews, and videotaping. These particular methods were selected for their potential to 
provide the richest data as well to emphasize cross-verification of the data sources. 

In the first weeks of the study, my role in the laboratory classroom was primarily 
observational, but as I observed and talked with students, I increasingly found situations arising that 
compelled my assistance. Consequently, my role in the classroom slowly evolved into one of a 
"second instructor." As such, my responsibilities expanded to include assisting students, grading 
papers, and setting/cleaning up the lab between classes. This role also helped to establish a 





227 247 



comfortable rapport and level of trust with the students and the instructor, which in turn facilitated 
data gathering. 

Interpretive research is by nature constantly comparative. Constant comparative methodology 
adopts the stance of always questioning gaps, omissions, inconsistencies, misunderstandings, and 
not-yet complete understandings (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). As a researcher working in this context, 
data was collected, coded, and analyzed as a ongoing process. On several occasions, a co-researcher 
independently collected data at the research site. The understanding generated through discussions 
with the co-researcher as well as the instructor of the course added significant insight to the analysis 
of the data. The primary analysis of data served to direct and focus the subsequent levels of data 
collection. As data collection drew to a close, insight and awareness into the data coalesced into a 
deeper understanding and appreciation of the dissection experience. This understanding evolved as 
all of the "pieces" from the data analysis were brought together and constructed into a more 
meaningful and holistic picture of the phenomenon. 



Data from the participant observation method was collected in the form of field notes. 
Observations included actions and language, as well as more subtle cues such as facial expressions, 
gestures, tone of voice and other unverbalized social interactions which suggest tacit meanings. 

Interviews were structured according to the interview guide approach outlined by McMillan 
& Schumacher (1989). According to this approach, the researcher asks questions concerning 
predetermined topics, but has freedom to choose the sequence and wording of the questions as the 
interview progresses. Questions were asked in a open-ended manner that allowed the students a great 
degree of latitude to pursue a range of ideas and to shape the content of the interview (Bogdan & 
Biklen, 1992). Probing and clarification questions were used to uncover specific meanings 
suggested by, but not fully developed in the participant's answers (Patton, 1990). All interviews 
were tape recorded and transcribed for data analysis. In order to preserve the essence of the 
participants' wording, interviews were transcribed verbatim. 



Nature of the Data 



ERIC 




The initial interview protocol was composed of five broadly worded, open-ended questions. 
For example, the first question of the protocol was simply, "How do you feel about dissection?" As 
the initial interviews and field notes were analyzed, the ideas that were most relevant to students 
perception of dissection were included in the protocol of subsequent interviews. Through this 
constantly comparative process, well supported ideas were carefully developed and explored through 
more detailed questioning, while ideas that could not be supported were abandoned. 

Upon the completion of the interviews, the protocol questions were developed into 
corresponding items on a survey instrument (See Appendix A). The five response categories on the 
survey ranged in agreement from "strongly agree" to "strongly disagree." The thirty-five item survey 
instrument, along with a well-established "attitudes toward dissection" (Strauss & Kinzie, 1991) 
survey were administered to all eighty five students in the study. Descriptive statistical analysis of the 
survey data is used to elaborate and enhance discussion of the qualitative data. 

Many of the laboratory sessions were videotaped. Videotapes were used as a secondary 
source of information. In order to minimize intrusiveness, the camera was secured on a tripod in a 
front comer of the classroom. Because of this limitation, only the loudest dialogue on the tapes is 
audible. Videotapes were analyzed for student positioning relative to dissection materials, gesturing, 
and their behavior toward one another and the animals they were dissecting. The narrative 
descriptions generated from the videotapes served to verify, elaborate, and enhance the dialogue 
from the students’ interviews. 

Discussion of Findings 

Extensive analysis of interview transcripts, field notes, and video-taped laboratory sessions 
revealed several major patterns in the data which were framed and supported by numerous minor 
patterns. Patterns revealed through data analysis are characterized by reoccurring thoughts, beliefs, 
attitudes, or feelings experienced by the students as they reflect on the dissection experience. 

The results of this study are organized around four dimensions that emerged from the various 
data sources. These dimensions, when taken together, create a multifaceted tool for viewing the 
dissection phenomenon. The first and most fundamental of these dimensions centers on the moral 





229 



issues prevalent in the minds of students as they reflect on the dissection experience. These moral 
issues include: the killing of animals; acceptable treatment of the dead; cultural taboo; and reflections 
on self. The second dimension concerns epistemological issues associated with dissection. These 
issues include: the empirical nature of dissection; the development of intellectual independence, 
discovery learning; investigation; elaborating on text information; development of a more holistic 
understanding; and hands-on learning. The third dimension explores the physical issues associated 
with the dissection experience as it is unfolds in the classroom. This dimension is generally 
expressed as students negatively perceive and reflect upon the immediate physical presence of 
dissection. Finally, the fourth dimension focuses on the issue of familiarity as it relates to dissection. 
Discussion in this dimension focuses around: positive or neutral everyday experiences with 
dissection; negative everyday experiences with dissection; and other familiar experiences relevant to 
dissection. 

These four dimensions are not intended to stand alone as independent categories within the 
ffot? Rather, they represent a subjective construction of an organizational scheme intended to guide 
the discussion of the data. In students' real-life cognitive, affective, and physical interaction with the 
phenomenon of dissection, none of these dimensions exists in isolation from any other. Rather, it is 
the intertwining and overlapping of these dimensions that form the essence of the dissection 
experience for the participants. 

In brief, students' perception of the dissection experience was contingent on the consistency 
(or lack thereof) of their personal value systems with the underlying beliefs found in each of the four 
dimensions of dissection. Students’ attitudes are affected by the beliefs (and their underlying values) 
in varying degrees, and many times their influences are overlapping. 

Along the four dimensions, students' perceptions of dissection are expressed in terms of their 
position on seven belief statements. The belief statements were inductively generated through 
extensive and prolonged analysis of data. These seven beliefs represent what the researcher feels are 
implicit in the activity of dissection. Periodically, survey items are provided to give an overview of 




250 



230 



general student responses. As stated earlier, survey items are constructed directly from students’ 
narrations of their thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes. 

The killing of animals for the purpose of learning is a justifiable and acceptable behavior is 
the first belief embedded in the dissection experience. Students' beliefs about killing generally fell 
into three categories, each with a range of agreement: 1) killing can be fun; 2) killing is acceptable 
with good reason; and 3) killing is objectionable. Students agreeing with the first two of these beliefs 
are most likely to have a positive experience with dissection. 

The survey instrument contained two items corresponding to the first belief statement, 

“killing can be fun.” On the survey instrument 40% of the 85 students responded that they agreed or 
strongly agreed (hereafter referred to as “agreement”) with the statement, “It can be exciting to kill 
animals for food (like deer)," and 38% agreed or strongly agreed with the statement, "It can be 
exciting to kill animals that are dangerous (like snakes)." 

Seventy-three percent of the students were in agreement with the statement, "I feel okay if an 
animal is killed as long as it is for a good reason," and no one strongly disagreed with the statement. 
This item corresponds with the second belief statement, “killing is acceptable with good reason.” 

On the survey instrument, 22% of the students were in agreement with the statement, "I am 
opposed to killing animals," and 26% of the students responded that they were undecided on the 
issue. This item corresponds with the third belief statement, “killing is objectionable.” 

Touching the dead body of an animal is a socially and culturally acceptable behavior is the 
second belief inherent in dissection activities. Student beliefs about this social and cultural acceptance 
generally fell into two categories: 1) dissection is uncomfortable because cutting open dead animals is 
a socially unacceptable behavior; and 2) dissection is exciting because cutting open dead animals is 
socially unacceptable behavior. Students who agreed with the second axis were more likely to have a 

positive experience with dissection, however, this factor was not relevant to a large number of 
students (57%). 

On the survey, 23% of the 85 students responded that they agreed or strongly agreed with the 
statement, "Sometimes dissection is difficult for me because the way I was raised, you're just not 




231 

251 



supposed to be cutting open dead animals." Similarly, 20% of the 85 students were in agreement 
with the statement, "Dissection is exciting because we get to do something that we aren't supposed to 
do." 

The third belief is that the greater the similarity between the body of the animal and the human 
body, the greater the gains in understanding of human anatomy. Student beliefs generally fell into 
three categories of agreement. As the animal's body more closely resembles a human: 1) dissection 
becomes more exciting; 2) dissection becomes more disturbing; and 3) I feel like I learn more. 
Students falling into the first and third categories are more likely to have a positive experience 
dissecting more human-like animals (note: these categories are not mutually exclusive). 

On the survey, 43% of the students were in agreement with the statement: "As an animal's 
body more closely resembles the human body, dissection becomes more exciting" and 64% were in 
agreement with the statement "As an animal's body more closely resembles the human body, I feel 
like I learn more." Conversely, 35% of the students responded positively to the statement "As an 
animal s body more closely resembles the human body, dissection becomes more disturbing." 

Cutting apart, probing, and pinning is acceptable treatment of a dead animal's body is the 
fourth belief associated with dissection. Student beliefs fell into the categories of: 1) moral 
consideration is extended to dead animals; 2) limited moral consideration is extended to dead animals; 
and 3) once the animal has died, moral consideration of it no longer relevant Students agreeing with 
the second and third beliefs are more likely to have a positive experience with dissection. 

Thirty-five percent of the students were in agreement with the statement, "During dissection, 

I feel like I'm being disrespectful to the animal," and 37% were in agreement with the statement, 
Sometimes during dissection, I feel like I'm hurting the animal." These items correspond with the 
belief that moral consideration is extended to dead animals. 

Conversely, 48% of the students disagreed with the statement, "During dissection, I feel like 
I'm being disrespectful to the animal," and 48% disagreed with the statement, "Sometimes during 
dissection, I feel like I'm hurting the animal." These items correspond with the belief that moral 
consideration is not relevant to dead animals. 





Interaction between students and the dissection specimens will result in their gaining 
understanding of the structure and function of the animal's internal anatomical structures is the fifth 
belief. Student beliefs fell into two categories: 1)1 feel like I learn from dissection; and 2) dissection 
does not help me learn. Students falling into agreement on the first belief axis are more likely to have 
a positive attitude toward dissection. 

The sixth belief is that touching, seeing, or smelling the dead body of an animal is not 
offensive enough to negatively impact students' learning. Student beliefs fell into three categories: 1) 
dissection is unclean or dirty; 2) dissection smells bad; and 3) dissection is "gross." Students who 
are less inclined to agree with these attitudes are more likely to have a positive attitude towards 
dissection. On the survey, 39% of the students were in agreement with the statement, "I think of 
dissection as being unclean or dirty,” and 85% of the students were in agreement with the statement, 
"I don't like the smell associated with dissection." Comments of this nature were by far the most 
commonly heard in the classroom. 

Finally, the seventh belief, dissection as an activity is independent of the experiences the 
students are familiar with, and how they interpret those experiences. Related student beliefs fell into 
three categories: 1) positive or neutral everyday experiences with dissection-like activities; 2) 
negative everyday experiences with dissection-like activities and; 3) other familiar experiences 
relevant to the perception of dissection (for the purposes of this study, "dissection-like" activities are 
those that involve the inside of an animal, such as hunting/cleaning animals, surgery, preparation of 
meat, etc.). Students agreeing with the first category were strongly inclined to have a positive attitude 
toward dissection, while those agreeing with the second category were strongly inclined to have a 
negative attitude toward dissection. Sets of values characterize each of the six beliefs inherent in the 
activity of dissection. These values may be negatively worded, as in "suffering should not be 
tolerated," or positively worded, as in "courage is an admirable quality," depending on the context in 
which they emerged. These value sets are described in Appendix B. 

Conclusions 



O 

ERiC 



233 



In this research study I have attempted to construct a model of the meaning students assign 
to the dissection experience through a comprehensive exploration of the issues most prevalent in 
students' minds as they relate their thoughts and feelings about the issue. Conclusions are addressed 
with the research questions as organizers. 

1. What major factors in the life experiences of the students (gender, religion, past 
experience) contribute to the development of their value systems related to the dissection experience? 

Students related various life experiences that were instrumental in shaping their perceptions 
of dissection. These familiar experiences are woven throughout the data as students related stories of 
their home life and upbringing. Examples of these experiences were: hunting; fishing; working with 
and/or killing domesticated food animals; religious teaching; parental teaching; taxidermy; and 
pregnancy. In the findings of the study, these experiences emerge as strong influences on students' 
perceptions of dissection. In a related study, Crowell, Smith, Oliver, Simpson, & Adams (1987) 
explored the influence of veterinary students' life experiences on their attitudes towards animal use. 
Conclusions of the study revealed that students from rural areas were more likely to have liberal 
attitudes towards the use of animals. This finding suggests that unlike students from urban areas, 
students living in rural areas are more likely to be familiar with using animals in their everyday life. 
As these students are familiar with behaviors associated with animal use, they should, therefore, 
hold more positive attitudes towards those behaviors. In general, this finding suggests that 
individuals have a tendency to develop positive attitudes towards familiar life experiences. 

Applying this assumption to the context of dissection suggests that students whose home life 
includes dissection-like activities, such as hunting, fishing, or killing chickens, should be more 
likely to have a positive attitude towards dissection. However, this assumption is contradicted in the 
findings of the study. The life experiences that were familiar to the students were not always 
positively interpreted, in fact, many times "the familiar" took on a very negative meaning. For 
various students, very similar life experiences might take on either positive or negative meaning. 
Consequently, the influence of familiar life experiences on student perceptions lies in the 
interpretation and meaning constructed by the individual student.

An example of the highly variable influence of the “familiar,” religious teachings emerged as 
a factor contributing to students’ perception of the killing of animals. However, according to the 
findings of the study, religious beliefs in themselves cannot be assumed to shape perception of 
dissection in a positive or negative direction. The influence of religious teachings on students' 
perception is dependent on individual interpretation. This was illustrated as students cited their 
religious beliefs in narrations of both negative and positive attitudes towards the killing of animals 
(Certain students who expressed deep religious beliefs negatively interpreted dissection because they 
felt it was disrespectful to God's creation, while others positively interpreted dissection because they 
felt God put animals here for our use). The responses suggested that assumptions or general 
statements can not be made concerning the effects of religious beliefs on perceptions of dissection. 

Experiences with hunting also highlight the significance of students' interpretations of 
familiar phenomena. Regardless if the student was male or female, actively or passively involved, 
familiarity with hunting was interpreted in variety of ways. This pattern also emerged in students' 
narrations of killing domesticated animals for food, fishing, and parental teachings. 

On several occasions, students related familiar experiences that were indirectly or abstractly 
associated with dissection, but were nevertheless important in shaping their perception of dissection. 
These experiences deviated somewhat from the more stereotypical dissection-like activities (hunting 
and fishing, etc.) and involved topics such as pregnancy and illness of a loved one. These abstract 
and obscure influences on student's perceptions emphasizes the complex nature of the influence of 
life experiences on students' construction of meaning. 

2. How do the students' personal values compare and contrast with those found in the 
secondary science curriculum? 

Goodenough ( 1963) wrote of the relationship between people’s values and the community to 
which they belong. He maintained that for any given community or social class, there will be some 
value orientations that are common to the personal sentiments of virtually everyone in it. He goes on 
to say that small, unstratified communities tend to have a broader base of common sentiments than 
do large and socially complicated ones. According to Goodenough's premise ( 1963), a comparison 




235 255 



of the two value systems discussed in this study should reveal that the scientific community, a 
smaller, less stratified group than the students in the study, possesses a much more consistent, 
unified, and consolidated set of values. 

Simpson, Koballa, Oliver, & Crawley (1994) identified several values they considered 
relevant to scientific inquiry. These are: 1) longing to know and understand; 2) questioning of all 
things; 3) search for data and their meaning; 4) demand for verification; 5) respect for logic and; 6) 
consideration of the consequence. A comparison of this list of six values relative to the widely 
variable list of 39 values students related during their discussions of dissection supports 
Goodenough's premise. The values associated with scientific inquiry are much more consistent, 
unified, and consolidated than the students' personal values relevant to the activity of dissection. 

Of the six values listed by Simpson, Koballa, Oliver, and Crawley (1994), three also emerge 
as students related their thoughts on the epistemological issues embedded in dissection. While the 
values considered relevant to scientific inquiry are centered around cognitive and epistemological 
considerations, the large number of student values reflected in the study move beyond the boundaries 
of these issues. Although scientific inquiry is described as a value-laden human endeavor 
(Lederman, 1992) value constructs such as kindness, respect for authority, love, excitement, 
aggression, and suffering are absent from its description. Comparing and contrasting these sets of 
values marks a wide division between student and scientific values. 

Implications 

Heated debate surrounds the issue of whether or not dissection should be used in the high 
school biology classroom. Participants in debates rhetorically champion one viewpoint or the other, 
addressing the reasons why dissection should or should not be used in the classroom. Proponents of 
dissection argue that it grounds scientific understanding of animal anatomy in empirical evidence- 
that students need to see and feel it for themselves in order to learn. Opponents of dissection center 
their arguments on biology as the study of living organisms and their interactions, and that dissection 
teaches students a disrespect for life. Unfortunately, in the end these types of discussions offer little 
help for teachers and teacher educators who speculate over the usefulness of dissection as an 



instructional tool. Dissection is perceived as a wonderful learning tool by some students while it acts 
to alienate others from learning. In providing an analysis of how individuals perceive dissection 
along with an exploration of the underlying values and beliefs that shape those perceptions, this 
research provides novel insight into the dissection experience. 

The moral values forming the organizational core of the study are deeply held by the 
participants, and when violated can sometimes cause a great deal of emotioned discomfort for 
students. Moreover, it is suggested that the issues of religious beliefs, death and suffering, and 
humans' place in nature, which saturate the students' narrations, are of paramount importance 
relative to all other moral issues. Educators who maintain dissection is the "only" way to learn about 
animal anatomy are disregarding the value-oriented nature of their students. Imposing the moral 
values of others on students and expecting they act and feel in a manner conducive to learning is 
unrealistic. It is unlikely that students whose moral values are at odds with those inherent in 
dissection will have a positive learning experience with the activity. For these students, alternatives 
to dissection provide a vehicle through which they can comfortably learn about animal anatomy. 

In spite of the tendency to minimize the importance of dissection's physical dimension, 
physical aversion was found to impinge on students' learning from dissection. Comments 
concerning physical aversion were by far the most commonly heard in the classroom, while 
comments about learning were some of the least common. 

Many educators who choose not to use dissection in their classrooms argue that the 
understanding students gain from dissecting an animal is minimal. While it was beyond the scope of 
this study to quantitatively evaluate the effect of dissection on students' learning, many students did 
have positive attitudes about learning from dissection. For these students, whose value systems are 
consistent with those in dissection, the activity seems to build upon a natural curiosity about their 
own bodies. This curiosity, coupled with the excitement some students experience during dissection, 
increases its potential as a very motivational learning tool. 

Findings suggest that the students found the frog, turtle, and shark dissections the most 
interesting and informative, and the earthworms, perch, and grasshoppers the least informative.

Some students also found the fetal pigs to be useful and informative. However, so many of the 
negative feelings in the study centered around dissecting the fetal pigs, that the decision to use them 
should be weighed carefully. 

The students involved in this study have given new insight into the long-fought debate over 
the use of dissection in the high school biology classroom. Ultimately, the responsibility of the 
decision to use or not to use dissection falls to the high school teacher. We hope that teachers and 
teacher educators alike can use the information in this study to make more informed decisions about 
the use of dissection in the high school biology classroom.

INFLUENCE OF AN EXTENDED ELEMENTARY SCIENCE TEACHING 
PRACTICUM EXPERIENCE UPON PRESERVICE ELEMENTARY 
TEACHERS’ SCIENCE SELF-EFFICACY 

John R. Cannon, University of Nevada, Reno 

Introduction 

Science self-efficacy repeatedly has been identified as an influential construct in science 
teaching (Riggs, 1988; Enochs & Riggs, 1990; Vinson, 1995; Cole, 1995; Wilson, 1996). 

Bandura (1977) was one of the first to suggest that one's abilities were mediated by individual 
expectations of personal efficacy, or self-efficacy. Self-efficacy, or increasing the extent to which 
teachers believe they can influence student learning, is an important attribute in effective science 
teaching (Enochs & Riggs, 1990; Ramey-Gassert, 1993; Enochs, Scharmann, & Riggs, 1995; ). 
Self-efficacy can be influenced by a variety of factors, e.g., gender, content area, and professional 
standing (inservice vs. preservice). Preservice teachers, then, ideally should possess a high degree 
of self-efficacy involving the teaching of science in order for their students to be positively 
influenced about learning science. 

Practicum experiences in colleges or schools of education were defined for this research as 
a course of study designed especially for the preparation of teachers and clinicians that involves 
the supervised practical applications(as in classroom or clinic) of previously studied theory. 
Practica experiences such as these have oft resided within the course requirements of teacher 
preparation programs. 

For example. The University of Montana, Missoula, Montana, 22 years ago required of 
education majors EDUC 200, Orientation to Education. The major component of EDUC 200 




247 2B7 



was field work, teaching lessons in content areas, such as math, science, or reading, at one of the 
local schools. 

Practica, or field experiences, are not the clarion call that many staunch educational 
reformists of the past decade have been demanding. Goodlad(1990) comments of the need for 
teacher educators to realize the likely discrepancy between the ideals of the methods course and 
the reality of the classroom. 

Indeed, educational reform zealots note that practicum experiences can be traced back to 
the era of the one room school house where older children were teaching the little children. 

The variety of practica (or field/laboratory/clinical) experiences for preservice teachers 
continue to be diverse. With the expansion of the World Wide Web, and the Internet, more and 
more colleges and universities are rushing to post their school's professional programs and course 
requirements on institutional Websites or homepages. In less than one hour, one can surf through 
the many such Web sites maintained by both large and small colleges and universities and can 
clearly see this diversity in practice. For example, the Penn State College of Education homepage 
( http://www.ed.psu.edu.dept/cert/student_services/field_exp.html) notes that "all teacher 
certification programs have pre-student teaching field experiences as part of their curriculum" 
(line 6). No less than eight courses fulfill this requirement, which range from students spending 5 
days in an elementary school to be followed by five days in a high school to "a three credit 
practicum taken concurrently with methods courses from the. . .areas of math, science, and social 
studies education" (lines 22-23). Penn State education students are in the schools for 
approximately one and a half days per week and participate in a seminar. The state of Kentucky, 
through their Kentucky Education Reform Act (KERA) enacted in 1990, requires that "each 





248 



student must spend a total of 1 50 hours in field experiences and laboratory experiences prior to 
student teaching" and that "at least 75 hours of the 150 hour total must be in field experiences in 
the schools" (Centre University, http://centre.edu/academic/programs/edu/handbook/lfield.htm, 
lines 2-4). 

Kent State University requires "300 clock hours of field/clinical experiences before 
[students] are able to teach" (Kent State University, available via the World Wide Web at 
http://monster.educ.kent.edu/CoE/Offices.PDP/early.htm). The University of Iowa also requires 
"a minimum of 50 clock hours of practicum to fulfill minimum Iowa licensure requirements" 
(University of Iowa, http://www.uiowa.edu/~coe2/entities/studserv/field-experience.htm, lines 27- 
28). Practica experiences are not just for major universities. Saint Mary's University in Winona, 
Minnesota, requires courses in which "field experiences are required" (http://www.mnsmc.edu). 

Farris, Henniger, and Bischoflf(1991) reviewed the current state of practicum experiences. 
In a study of 2 1 7 of the largest teacher education programs of public colleges and universities, 
the perceived diversity in practica experiences was grounded in reality. They found that field 
experiences for education students varied from spending 5.20 hours per week in schools over a 
seven week period to two full days a week in attendance. Surprisingly, they also report that 
"supervision of the early clinical [e.g. practicum] experiences ranged from no on-site visits by the 
university supervisor to a high of four or more visits for the first experience" and that "15.2% [out 
of 1 75 responding institutions] require supervision by university personnel for second and third 
year experiences (p. 23). 




249 



The Problem and Purpose 



This albeit short, but telling, review of practica experience literature reveals that education 
majors appear to be out in the schools, but as to for how long, under whose supervision, and 
exactly what the requirements of the education majors are in these experiences is as diverse as 
there are institutions of higher learning and states of the union. There seems to be no even 
imprecise measurement as to exactly "how much" or "how many" practica experiences should be 
required for the preservice education majors. With more and more responsibilities being placed on 
university faculty resources, the issues of "how much" and "how many" experiences become even 
more significant. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare two early field(practica) 
experiences of two different land grant universities; one in the midwest, one in the west. The 
midwestem university students taught one science lesson in an elementary school as their 
practicum experience. The western university students taught elementary science for an entire 
semester for their practicum experience. The data from the study are preservice elementary 
teachers' personal science teaching efficacy scores (PSTEB) from the Science Teaching Efficacy 
Beliefs Inventory (STEBI version B) by Enochs and Riggs (1990) from both universities. 

Research Questions and Hypotheses To Be Tested 
There were three research questions to be tested: 

1. Does an extended science teaching practicum experience positively influence a preservice teacher's 
personal science teaching efficacy beliefs? 

2. Is science self-efficacy influenced by the length of the teaching practicum? 



O 

ERIC 



250 



270 



3. Does taking an elementary science methods course along with the practicum experience influence 
science self-efficacy? 

The corresponding hypotheses were as follows: 

1 . There is no significant variance between the PSTEB scores of differing practica experiences( single, 
one time experience vs. extended, 10 week practica). 

2. There is no significant variance between the PSTEB scores of differing practica experiences( single, 
one time experience vs. extended, 10 week practica). 

3. There is no significant variance of PSTEB scores of the western university's preservice teachers' who 
have previously taken an elementary methods course and those western university's preservice teachers 
who have never taken an elementary science methods course. 



Method 

Subjects 

Subjects included 64 preservice elementary education majors. Forty-six students were 
from a large midwestem university (41 females and 5 males) and 18 (14 females and 4 males) 
were from a land grant university in the west. The subjects level of academic preparation varied 
by institution. 

The students from the midwestem university were in their final semester before student 
teaching and were enrolled in a 3 semester credit elementary science methods class which required 
a single, one time only science teaching practicum experience. The students from the western 
university were enrolled in a 3 semester credit Supervised Elementary Education Practicum 
course open to juniors, seniors, and graduate students. The teacher preparation program of the 




251 



271 



western university included Masters degree, first time licensure graduate students in the practicum 
course. None of the preservice teachers taking the practicum course were concurrently enrolled 
in an elementary science methods course. Both groups of students were determined as being from 
the same population (elementary education majors) based upon the lack of statistically significant 
differences of their Preprofessional Skills Tests scores in reading( t = -1 .78, p = . 10), writing( t = 
9.36 ,p = .92), and mathematics( t = -1.63, p = .11). 

Instrumentation 

The STEBI B (preservice version) (Enochs & Riggs, 1990) was administered to both 
groups of preservice elementary teachers. The STEBI B includes 23 Likert-scaled statements 
relating to personal beliefs about teaching science. Response categories are "strongly agree," 
"agree," "uncertain," "disagree," and "strongly disagree." The STEBI B measures two sub-scales 
inhering to Bandura's (1977) theory of self-efficacy and applied to teaching by Gibson and Dembo 
(1984). The two subscales are personal science teaching efficacy beliefs (PSTEB) and science 
teaching outcome expectancy(STOE). The sub-scale for PSTEB numbers 13 statements. A full 
account of the reliability and validity measures for STEBI B can be found in Enochs and Riggs 
(1990). This study resulted in a Cronbach's alpha of .83 for the PSTEB and .77 for the STOE. 

The administration of the STEBI B occurred at roughly the same time for both groups. 
The midwestem group completed the STEBI B after teaching one science lesson in a public 
school. This lesson was taught near the end of the university semester. The lessons lasted 
approximately 1 and a half to 2 hours in length. 

The western preservice teachers completed the STEBI B after an extended practicum 
experience in a local public school. The practicum experience ran from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon 



0 




252 272 



on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, for 10 weeks, totaling 120 hours of pupil contact time. 
Although the primary responsibility of the preservice elementary students in the practicum was to 
teach science lessons from the adopted public school science curriculum, they also were 
responsible for daily management routines and any other planned content area lessons with the 
permission of the cooperating classroom teacher. 

Analysis 

A modified quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design with nonequivalent groups was 
used in this research. PSTEB data obtained from the midwestem university was compared to 
PSTEB data collected from the western university. The independent variable was the different 
university preservice elementary teacher groups(midwestem and western). The dependent 
variable was the PSTEB scores from the STEBI B for both groups. The experimental group was 
the western university’s preservice teachers. The experimental treatment was the length of the 
practicum experiences(10 week long practicum experience as compared to a single 1 and a half to 
2 hour practicum experience). The control group was the midwestem university preservice 
elementary teachers. Due to the small sample size and ordinal nature of the STEBI B data, 
nonparametric analyses were deemed appropriate. 

Results and Discussion 

Mann- Whitney U tests were performed on both pre and posttest PSTEB scores from both 
university’s preservice teachers. No significant differences were found in the pretest PSTEB 
scores between the midwestem and western preservice elementary teachers as seen in Table 1.

Research Question One 

The first research question, "Does an extended science teaching practicum experience positively 
influence a preservice teacher’s personal science teaching efficacy beliefs?", was found to be true. The 
Mann- Whitney U test results indicate that an extended practicum experience does positively influence a 
preservice teacher’s personal science teaching efficacy beliefs when compared to a single, one time only 
practica experience (see Table 2). 

Research Question Two 

The Mann-Whitney U test results for the second research question, "Is science self-efficacy 
influenced by the length of the teaching practicum?", suggest that the length of a practicum experience 
does influence a preservice teacher's personal science teaching efficacy beliefs (see Table 2). In addition.

the median PSTEB posttest score of the midwestem preservice teachers' group was 56 as compared to 
the western preservice teachers' group PSTEB median score of 60.

Research Question Three 

The third research question, "Does taking an elementary science methods course along with the 
practicum experience influence science self-efficacy?", was found to be false. An Analysis of Variance of 
PSTEB posttest scores reveal no significant difference in variance between the western university 
preservice teachers groups(methods vs. no methods) . This result suggests that previous enrollment in an 



elementary methods course has little influence on preservice teacher's personal science teaching efficacy 
beliefs (see Table 3).

A sign of valuable research is when more questions are raised from a project than were 
originally asked. This research study did exactly that. 

Based upon the review of self-efficacy research, one could safely predict that an extended 
practica experience would positively influence PSTEB scores more so than a shorter practica 
experience. Many have suggested that experience is the best teacher. What is interesting about 
this prediction is determining when, if ever, a point of diminishing return exists in field work or 
practica experiences. 

The midwestem university preservice teachers' mean PSTEB posttest score was 56.28 
(model response = 65) as compared to the western university's mean PSTEB posttest score of 
58.94 (mr = 65). A difference of roughly 3 points demonstrated statistical variance. Effect size 
was calculated to be .57 (reject practical significance if < .33) (Borg, Gall & Gall, 1993). Borg, 




256 



Gall, and Gall (1993) state that "an effect size of 1.00 is twice as large as effect size of .50. The 
mean of the effect sizes.. .can be calculated to yield an estimate of the effect of the experimental 
program or method... "(p. 171). Therefore, according to Borg et al. (1993) one could argue that 
the effect of the extended practicum was roughly twice as "effective" as the single, one time only 
practicum experience. 

What is the most ideal amount of practica experiences? The results of this study could be 
interpreted that preservice elementary science teachers who experience an increase from 
approximately 2 hours of practicum pupil contact time, teaching a single lesson in elementary 
science, to approximately 94 hours(adjusted from 120 hours for daily routine activities) of pupil 
contact science teaching time gain "twice" the effect of teaching experience from such an increase 
in hours. This conjecture, despite what the numbers report, cannot be validated based on 
PSTEB scores. 

But, yet another very important question arises. If the question raised above is reversed, 
could one argue for less time to be spent in elementary science teaching practica experiences? It 
appears that only 3 to 4 out of 65 total PSTEB points are gained toward "ideal" science teaching 
efficacy by increasing supervised practicum experience pupil contact teaching time by a factor of 
roughly 6. Does this result support the call for increased practicum experiences and time spent 
supervising such experiences by already overburdened university content area specialists? 
Perhaps, but this author strongly suggests that "a point of diminishing return" someday will be 
determined through an expanded research agenda relating to science self-efficacy and practica 
experiences. 




257 



277 



What is the most ideal (or effective) PSTEB score? The model response of 65 would be 
an appropriate answer. However, if one scores 56.28, does this mean they are only 86% of an 
science efficacious teacher? Is 86% of an efficacious elementary science teacher acceptable? To 
editorialize, this author gladly would place an 86% science efficacious elementary teacher in a 
classroom based upon observations of how dismal, if at all, elementary science is being taught in 
the public schools. 

Two surprising corollaries were the lack of influence of gender (N = 18, f=.Q\,df = 1, 
p = .91) and enrollment in an elementary science methods course(N = 1 8, f = 2.74, df = 1, 
p = .1 1) on the posttest PSTEB scores in the western university's practicum experience. Gender 
data were not asked for at the midwestem university. 

The western university’s preservice elementary teachers, not previously enrolled in an 
elementary science methods course, did receive a "crash course" in elementary science teaching 
before entering the public school classroom. This instruction amounted to 9 hours of class time. 
Taken at face value, this result suggests that an elementary science methods course is not a 
prerequisite for developing a highly science efficacious elementary teacher. All students at the 
midwestem university were enrolled in an elementary science methods course which required a 
single, one time only science teaching practicum experience. 

Conclusions 

To conclude, this research, however small in sample size, indicates that extended 
practicum experiences in elementary science teaching positively increases a preservice elementary 
science teacher's personal science teaching efficacy beliefs. Departures for further research 





258 



include 1) determining exactly where a preservice elementary teacher's PSTEB matures and 
remains stable, 2) exactly what type of experience(s) and how much pupil contact time is required 
for this PSTEB maturation and stabilization process to occur, and 3) locating or developing other 
sister-like STEBI B instruments that could be used in time series experimental designs to reduce 
the potential of the research subjects developing test sensitivity to one instrument being 
administered many times. All of the above are currently underway at the University of Nevada, 
Reno.

THE HEALTH SCIENCES AND TECHNOLOGY ACADEMY: 
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR SECONDARY SCIENCE 
TEACHERS THROUGH A COMMUNITY-BASED CURRICULUM 
ENRICHMENT PROGRAM FOR UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS 

James A. Rye, West Virginia University 

The Health Sciences and Tec hnology Academy 

The Health Science and Technology Academy (HSTA) is a partnership between West 
Virginia University (WVU) and communities (many rural Appalachian) in West Virginia, and is 
funded by several sources, including the W. K. Kellogg Foundation, Howard Hughes Medical 
Institute, and Dwight Eisenhower Science and Mathematics Act HSTA is pan of a “pipeline” of 
educational support programs offered through WVU to help financially disadvantaged and minority 
students interested in health science careers (e.g., pharmacy, medicine, nursing, dentistry) to 
realize their goals and insure that West Virginia’s future need for health care providers is met 
(Bock, 1996). As such, HSTA is administered through the Robert C. Byrd Health Sciences 
Center at WVU, but also involves university faculty from the natural sciences, education, 
mathematics, and other disciplines. HSTA programming is provided through on-campus (WVU) 
summer institutes and, more extensively, through extracurricular “after school” science (HSTA) 
clubs in West Virginia communities. It targets most directly financially disadvantaged and African- 
American students (hereafter referred to as underrepresented students), grades 8 through 12. The 
program was launched with 45 students from two counties in 1994. Currently, about 200 
students— over 60% female and 40% minority (mostly African-American)— from 1 1 West Virginia 
counties participate in HSTA, and funding is being sought for program expansion. 

The long range goal of HSTA is to increase the number of underrepresented students who 
complete a post-secondary education in the health sciences and remain in West Virginia as primary 
care givers. This goal responds to the need to bolster the college-going rate amongst 
underrepresented students and the number of health care practitioners in medically underserved and 
rural Appalachian West Virginia communities. The more immediate goals pertain directly to the 
multifaceted academic enrichment provided through HSTA, and are to increase the following in

281 



underrepresented students: (a) competence in science and mathematics, (b) technological literacy, 
(c) capability for leadership, (d) interest in pursuing postsecondary education in the health 
sciences, (e) study skills, (f) self-esteem and (g) allegiance to rural West Virginia communities. 
These goals respond to the need to provide equitable access to learning opportunities for 
underrepresented students, and specifically to foster higher levels of scientific literacy "for those 
who traditionally have not received encouragement to pursue science-women and girls, students 
of color . . (National Research Council, 1996, p. 221). 

Twenty-six secondary science and math teachers also participate in HSTA, and are the most 
important “learning resource” in the provision of academic enrichment to HSTA students (National 
Research Council, 1996). Accordingly, a critical thrust of HSTA is teacher professional 
development, and they have the opportunity to earn graduate credit leading to a Master’s degree in 
secondary science education through their role and responsibilities as a HSTA teacher-participant 
Teachers collaborate with post-secondary faculty in the natural and health sciences, education, and 
mathematics to provide HSTA students with on-campus learning experiences at the HSTA Summer 
Institutes. These learning experiences have ranged from study skill development (e.g., concept 
mapping) to research projects in the areas of forensic science and neuroanatomy to constructing 
World Wide Web sites (see <http://www.ana.wvu.edu/hsta>). Teachers learn about instructional 
strategies and resources for making successful community-based HSTA programming. The 
community-based programming extends this collaboration as teachers facilitate extracurricular 
HSTA club experiences for students, and network with community resources such as health care 
providers/facilities and professionals employed in areas related to environmental quality. These 
experiences include the development and conduct by students of extended investigations, where 
they make inquiry into problems that have relevance to health and local communities, and develop 
understandings about research and skills in collaboration and communication. 

Related to the learning of science through inquiry, the National Science Education 
Standards (National Research Council, 1996) describe the critical need for a paradigm shift from 
teacher-directed to student-centered instruction, where teachers become facilitators of learning. An 



O 

ERIC 



262 



282 



important anticipated outcome of the professional development provided by HSTA is this paradigm 
shift amongst teachers, and the transfer of what they learn and do in HSTA to their regular science 
classroom. In their article describing a professional development model that includes after school 
math, science, and technology clubs for elementary students, Shroyer, Ramey-Gassert, Hancock, 
Moore, and Walker (1995) contend that “professional development of teachers may well be one of 
the most critical aspects of the science education reform movement” (p. 112). 

Lieberman (1995) reports there is growing evidence that partnerships, such as HSTA, can 
be “powerful organizational arrangements” for teacher professional development, where teachers 
can “commit themselves to topics that are of intrinsic interest to them” and which “provide access 
to new ideas and a supportive community in which to begin translating these ideas into meaningful 
action in schools and classrooms” (p. 595). The majority of teacher professional development 
through HSTA programming takes place in the context of the extracurricular HSTA clubs, where 
teachers learn by doing and reflecting on their actions (Bullough & Gitlin, 1991), and where 
emphasis is placed on “teacher as source and facilitator of change” and “member of a collegial 
professional community” (National Research Council, 1996, p. 72). The remainder of this paper 
will describe the extracurricular HSTA clubs, relate HSTA club programming to teacher 
professional development (including specific graduate course assignments), and report teacher- 
participants’ evaluation of such programming and a related graduate course. 

Extracurricular HSTA Clubs 

A major thrust of HSTA is to establish "working" extracurricular science (HSTA) clubs 
that emphasize inquiry-based science and provide exposure to careers in the health sciences, and 
utilize community and higher education resources in doing so. As such, these HSTA clubs extend 
the school science program beyond the "walls" of the classroom for the student participants. 

Before describing these clubs in more detail, it is critical to acknowledge the tremendous challenge 
of engaging underrepresented students in science and math academic enrichment after a full day of 
school. Shroyer et al., (1995) reported that such after school programming for elementary level 
students needed to be fun, with the principal theme of problem solving in order to relate science 



O 

ERIC 



263 



283 



and math to students’ future lives. Such likely are even more critical at the secondary level, where 
HSTA club programming competes with several “after school” opportunities. On the other hand, 
programs like HSTA fill an important gap in extracurricular offerings, as described by one HSTA 
teacher in a graduate course assignment that solicited teachers' perceptions about what students 
were gaining from HSTA club experiences: 

They [some students] need to be associated with a club that makes them feel worthwhile 
and valuable and smart and important These kids that show those needs make me feel 
valuable. . . .Today’s schools leave out a large percentage of their students as far as 
extracurricular activities are concerned. Athletic or outgoing students are rewarded and 
placed into higher positions on the social ladder-shy, introverted, serious, and mature 
students are stigmatized and not allowed certain outlets. For some of my HSTA students, I 
see their pleasure in being involved and feeling important. 

Eighteen HSTA clubs are operational in the 1 1 counties targeted by HSTA. Each club is 
facilitated by 1 to 2 teachers, and an attempt is made to keep the teacher to student ratio to 1 : 10. 
Clubs meet from two to four times per month, usually after school (and sometimes on Saturdays) 
at the HSTA teachers’ schools. To facilitate community commitment to HSTA club programming, 
six regional Local Governing Boards have been established (the number of clubs “governed” by 
each board ranges from 1 to several). Board membership includes representation from parents of 
HSTA students, HSTA students, local schools, local health care facilities, and others in the ‘ 
communities. Boards are charged with providing guidance and decision-making in the areas of 
personnel, budget, curriculum and learning resources, and student recruitment and retention. A 
WVU faculty member in curriculum and instruction who has a health and science education 
background serves as the curriculum coordinator to teachers who facilitate the HSTA clubs. 
Teachers receive additional support and guidance from a HSTA program manager at WVU and six 
regional HSTA field site coordinators. These field site coordinators are a critical link between the 




264 



2.84 



community and WVU, and carry out vital roles in student recruitment and retention and 
identification of community resources for HSTA club programming. The field site coordinators 
are especially important in identifying opportunities for students to gain exposures to health care 
careers. In reference to the latter, a valuable resource to the field site coordinators are the clinics 
and learning resource centers of the West Virginia Rural Health Education Partnerships 
(WVRHEP) located throughout West Virginia. WVRHEP is a program of the University System 
of West Virginia and provides clinical training opportunities at rural health clinics and small rural 
hospitals around the state. 

The 4-H model (Division of Family & 4-H Youth Development, 1992) was adapted in 
setting forth organizational principals and group dynamics and providing a structure for HSTA 
club meetings. A model (yet flexible) agenda outline was provided for teachers to utilize in order 
to get the HSTA clubs “up and running: ” (a) begin the meeting with a brief inquiry/discovery 
activity (e.g., Liem, 1987) to engage students; (b) devote a significant amount of meeting time to 
utilizing the problem posing, problem solving, and peer persuasion (the “3Ps”) instructional model 
(Peterson & Jungck, 1988), in order to help students develop and carry out extended 
investigations, i.e., collaborative science projects; and (c) include in some meetings a presentation 
on a health career by a local health professional. Parental involvement in the meetings and student 
activity outside of the meetings also are emphasized. In regards to the latter, student activities have 
included shadowing local health care providers, volunteering at health care facilities and assisting 
with area health fairs and screenings (which also provide important community service), collecting 
data as part of extended science investigations, and taking field trips to higher education and 
government facilities. 

Contributing to the development of INTERNET literacy amongst students also is a goal of 
HSTA club programming. Through the Bell Atlantic World School Program, many of the schools 
where HSTA clubs meet have a direct connection to the INTERNET. Students conduct 
INTERNET searches to leam more about specific problems targeted by their extended 
investigations. It is anticipated that future uses of the INTERNET by HSTA students will include 




265 



posting data on collaborative science projects (e.g., water and air quality), video conferencing with 
other science clubs and university faculty, and establishing and maintaining HSTA club Web sites 
that will, amongst other features, showcase their extended investigations. 

As mentioned above, these extended investigations (i.e., science projects) are a principal 
thrust of HSTA club programming. Ideally, they arise from student brainstorming sessions about 
problems that exist in their own communities that have some connection to health. It is critical that 
students play a primary role in identifying the problems. Student interest is paramount to HSTA 
club attendance and all phases of the investigation, which includes proposal development, 
conducting the investigation, and developing and providing related poster and oral presentations at 
an annual HSTA science fair. During the 1995-96 school year, approximately 30 different 
investigations were carried out and presented at the HSTA 2nd Annual Science Fair. Each project 
usually was completed and presented by small groups as opposed individual students, in order to 
nurture collaboration and a “community of learners." Sample project titles as listed in the science 
fair brochure are shown in Table 1.

Many of the projects completed by students during the 1 995-96 school year targeted water 
quality. Water quality is a major concern in West Virginia, which has over 92,000 streams 
inventoried to date (Mains, 1993). Water quality has been negatively affected by acid mine 
drainage and other pollutants, and this impacts recreational opportunities in and the economy of the 
state. The project that posed a question about the affect of rock type on the benthic population and 
chemical composition of water was a collaboration between two HSTA clubs in different portions 
of a county. The project examined two streams, one which had been treated for acid mine drainage 
and another which ran through a "resort" golf course. The Weyerhaeuser project was an 
evaluation of the impact of construction of an oriented strand board industry on various chemical 
(e.g., phosphates and chlorine) and biological (e.g., benthic macroinvertebrates) parameters of a 
local stream. The project offered a robust learning experience through collaborating with private 
industry and a government agency (Rye, Burchett, McMillion, & Howell, 1996), and students are 
continuing this investigation during the 1996-97 school year by examining for any effect that 
industrial production of strand board has on the stream. Another investigation undertaken in 1996- 
97 by three HSTA clubs in three different counties targets emissions of nitrogen oxides 
(specifically NO and NO 2 ) in and surrounding students’ households and schools. This 
investigation involves collaboration with the Appalachian Division of the National Institutes for 
Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the WVU Institute for Environmental and 
Occupational Health. 



Teacher Professional Development 

HSTA teachers have the opportunity to enroll each semester in a graduate course (tuition 
waived to date) that dovetails with their learning experiences and responsibilities as a HSTA 
teacher-participant. In the Summer semester, the course is "advanced topics" and offered as part of 
their participation in a two-week HSTA Summer Institute. Throughout the school year (Fall and 
Spring semesters), the course is "special topics" and related principally to the facilitation of HSTA 
community-based science clubs. Past course enrollment has ranged from 10 to 13 teachers. 
Although these are separate courses, the content and assignments are interrelated, and thus should 





267 



be viewed more as a "package." For example, the "live" contact time with faculty in the advanced 
topics course that dovetails with the HSTA Summer Institute exceeds what would be expected for a 
3-credit graduate course; in the Fall and Spring semester offerings, teacher facilitation of the HSTA 
clubs constitutes much of the course contact time. Additionally, at the Summer Institutes, teachers 
gain experience with instructional methods and tools (e.g., "3Ps," concept mapping, graphing 
calculator) that they apply in the Fall and Spring offerings of the special topics graduate course. 

Teachers may elect to count up to 18 credits of this graduate course work towards a 36- 
credit Master of Arts in Secondary Science Teaching degree program at WVU. Sixty-three (63) 
percent of the HSTA teachers indicated that the opportunity to earn a Masters degree through 
HSTA participation was a motivating factor for joining HSTA— currendy about one-half (12 
individuals) of the HSTA teachers are pursuing this degree. The WVU science education faculty 
member who is the HSTA community curriculum coordinator also serves as (a) the academic 
advisor for the cohort of HSTA teachers pursuing this Masters’ degree, (b) the instructor of the 
Fall and Spring semester special topics offerings, and (c) one of several HSTA Summer Institute 
faculty. Additionally, this faculty member networks with various instructors and special programs 
in the WVU College of Human Resources and Education to increase the “availability” and utility of 
other elective and required courses in the HSTA teachers’ graduate program. For example, a 
required course in educational philosophy for the HSTA cohort currently spans the entire school 
year as opposed to one semester, and is offered on select weekends at a location much closer than 
the WVU campus for the majority of HSTA teachers. Additionally, several HSTA teachers are 
fulfilling graduate credit requirements that target trends and methods in secondary science 
education through WVU graduate courses developed by the West Virginia K-12 RuralNet Project 
(Wiesenmayer, Meadows, Rubba, Lantz, & Kelly, 1997). This project develops/furthers teachers’ 
INTERNET literacy and ability to utilize the latter as a science education tool, and the course is 
principally taught "on-line" via e-mail, webboard, listserves, etc. 

Students and Research (Cothron, Giese, & Rezba, 1993) and the National Science 
Education Standards have been principal texts for the special topics courses offered during Fall and 



O

268 



288 



Spring semesters. Course assignments are geared to (a) “make HSTA work” at the community 
level, (b) facilitate application of what teachers learn and experience in the HSTA Summer Institute 
to HSTA club programming, and (c) facilitate transfer of what teachers learn in HSTA to their 
regular science classroom. Additionally, the Spring semester course offering includes an 
assignment to develop a proposal for a mini-workshop, which teachers conduct at the HSTA 
Summer Institute to acquaint other HSTA teachers and Summer Institute faculty with science 
education activities/resources that they have found effective in HSTA club programming. Past 
mini-workshops have targeted the collection and analysis of data based on the contents of packages 
of M&Ms™, investigations of the effects of UV radiation on the skin, and the sharing of science 
project resources from an international conference. A major assignment in the Spring course 
offering is to facilitate science project data analysis and the preparation and delivery by HSTA 
students’ of science project presentations at the HSTA Annual Science Fair. , 

Table 2 sets forth an abridged version of the course assignments for the Fall (1996) 
semester offering. The majority of teachers chose from "additional assignments" the application of 
the concept map tool-teachers had completed a self-instructional packet (Rye, 1995) and several 
applied sessions on this tool as preparation for and during the HSTA 1996 Summer Institute. 
Concept map applications included introducing the idea of "chemistry" and teaching about types of 
human tissue in high school science courses, teaching about solutions in a middle level science 
course, and representing and narrowing activities for HSTA club projects. Reflections made by 
teachers about the utility of the tool were quite positive and indicated an impact on the teachers’ 
regular classroom science instruction-an important goal of HSTA. Excerpts taken from two of the 
assignments serve as examples of this impact: 

It was the best introduction I’ve come up with to date I plan to "reteach" my first day 

lesson the same way. . .next year and to "revisit" the method as extra credit on the chapter 
1 test. It was one of those successful days that makes teaching worthwhile. 



O 

ERIC 



269 



The results were really good. So good, in fact, some of my fellow science teachers are 
.going to try it with some future units and definitely use it next year with this unit. . . .After 
the mapping activity, I got the response, "oh I see," which made me feel good. 

Two to three teachers each chose the graphing calculator application and to write a paper on the 
National Science Education Standards — assignments which applied other content and tools from the 
HSTA Summer Institute. 

Most of the enrolled teachers have e-mail, which enriches the course and makes more 
convenient the submission of assignments and communication with the instructor, e.g., the 
instructor and teachers can exchange URLs and other information found through INTERNET 
searches as well as listserve e-mail messages that have bearing on HSTA club programming and 
student projects. HSTA funding has enabled the purchase of notebook computers for use by 
several of the HSTA teachers/clubs and facilitated connectivity outside of the school setting 
through INTERNET providers, e.g.. Serial Line Intemet/Point-to-Point Protocol (SLIP/PPP) 
connections at West Virginia Network for Educational Telecomputing modem pools located 
throughout the state. Such also allows teachers to utilize the INTERNET from home, which 
extends considerably the amount of time they can devote to building INTERNET literacy. HSTA 
staff plans to expand INTERNET utilization for participating teachers through upgrades to the 
HSTA Web site (<http://www.hsc.wvu.edu^sta>), including video conferencing, HSTA club 
home pages, chat rooms, and more links to "experts" in higher education. 

Early in the Fall, 1996, semester, an opportunity arose for teachers to field-test in their 
HSTA clubs or classrooms nutrition investigations (e.g., laboratory analysis of calcium and iron in 
foods) that were being developed as a part of an interdisciplinary nutrition high school curriculum 
by a state department of education. About one-third of all (12) enrolled teachers opted to complete 
this field test as one of the “assignments designed by you” (Table 2). The topic of human nutrition 
is well suited to HSTA club programming, because it cuts across many of the health science 
professions and can be utilized as a vehicle to enhance science and math instruction (Rye, in 




270 



290 



press). HSTA staff recently received a professional development grant that will enable teachers to 
learn more about human nutrition and related science and math applications.

Evaluation bv HSTA Teacher-Participants 
HSTA Community Programming 

The Office of Health Services Research (OHSR) at WVU carries out the program 
evaluation of HSTA. After the HSTA 2nd Annual Science Fair in May, 1996, OHSR administered 
a questionnaire to HSTA teacher-participants (n = 2 1) to obtain their assessment of HSTA 
community-based programming for the 1 995-96 school year. A previous questionnaire, utilized 
numerous times throughout the 1995-96 school year to solicit HSTA teachers' perceptions of the 
utility of site visits made by the HSTA curriculum coordinator, aided in the development of this 
post-science fair questionnaire. The data collected by this questionnaire included responses from 
HSTA teachers who did not enroll in either the Fall or Spring semester offerings of the special 
topics (HSTA) graduate courses. It is important to emphasize that HSTA provides a professional 
development benefit to teachers regardless of their enrollment in these courses. These “other” 
teachers, some of whom already had a Masters degree, still attended HSTA teacher-participant 
workshops in the Fall and Spring semesters. Additionally, like all HSTA teachers, they learn from 
facilitating HSTA science clubs and have the opportunity to “try out” new instructional 
methodologies and inquiry activities in a “lower risk” environment. 

All questions asked teachers to give an open-ended response. Questions that also requested 
teachers respond on a Likert- type scale (1 = nothing/not effective to 5 = a lot/very effective) elicited 
their perceptions of (a) how much they learned from their involvement in HSTA club 
programming, (b) how much they enjoyed their involvement in the HSTA club, (c) how much 
their HSTA students learned from their HSTA science projects, and (d) the overall effectiveness of 
HSTA community-based programming. Table 3 provides the mean scale ratings of teachers on 
these questions, the most common reason (open-ended responses collapsed as possible into logical 
categories) given to explain their rating, and the frequency of the most common open-ended 
response.

The mean ratings (M = 4.2 to 4.5) provided by teachers, and especially the high rating (M 
= 4.5) on “effectiveness” of community-based programming, are impressive given that this was 
the first year of involvement for most teachers and the challenge of engaging students in science 
and math academic enrichment in an after school setting. Teachers’ justifications for their ratings 
on program effectiveness most often spoke to student benefits, e.g., programming was good for 
students and students were excited about meeting health professionals and more aware of 
opportunities. Two teachers responded rather dramatically as to these benefits: “This has been 
fantastic for my kids. Many would probably be stuck up a hollow with junk around the house the 
rest of their lives.” “HSTA has kept science alive. My HSTA kids are so enjoying the program 
that I have many kids who want to join.” 

Teachers' explanations for ratings about their own learning (M = 4.2) and enjoyment (M = 
4.3) from involvement in the clubs provided insight into the ways teachers perceived they were 
developing professionally, and how that compared with professional development outcomes that

HSTA staff hoped teachers were achieving through program participation. Perhaps most important 
here were that approximately one-fourth of teachers felt they learned how to guide students through 
HSTA activities and feel ownership in their projects, and that they enjoyed working with the 
students on these projects. [In response to a different question, the science club activity reported 
by teachers most frequently (n = 12-more than 50% of teachers) as “liked the best” was the 
students community science project and participating in the HSTA science fair that showcased 
those projects.] Justifications provided by a few of the teachers included "I have learned that my 
students can learn from their own experiences," "How to phrase questions to help draw students 
out , and that The kids are terrific. Watching their development as scientific investigators is 
fun." Another teacher spoke to the difficulty of changing his or her instructional paradigm: “I’ve 
learned to give the students more freedom in their learning, but it is still hard to give up old habits.” 
Other reasons provided by teachers to justify their ratings about how much they learned from 
HSTA spoke to additional benefits HSTA staff hoped to provide the teachers, and included that 
they learned "how to be more confident in teaching experimental design," "many techniques and 
teaching strategies and have been able to incorporate them into my classroom," and "more about 
my community and know there are many untapped resources." 

Teachers rating of how much students learned (M = 4.2) from their science project was 
most commonly justified by stating that students learned the value of the research process and 
experimental design. Almost one-fourth of the teachers also explained their rating by stating that 
students learned basic knowledge about the subject that they were researching. One teacher’s 
response was rather blunt, yet spoke directly to the “opportunity” provided through academic 
enrichment programs such as HSTA: "I feel that they learned a lot of information that they would 
never have learned elsewhere." 

The group of HSTA students attending the HSTA 2nd Annual Science Fair also were 
surveyed to determine their perceptions of what they had learned from their HSTA science project. 
One hundred and fourteen students responded, and the mean rating (1-5 Likert-type scale) was 3.8 
(excludes two students who responded “no opinion”). Most frequently (18% of students). 




274 



294 



students reported learning “a lot” with no specific details given. The most frequent content area 

cited was water quality. Two students’ explanations are of particular interest, as they spoke to 

critical characteristics desired in the learning atmosphere of HSTA clubs and corroborated teachers’ 

explanations: "I learned a lot of stuff about water that I never really new before and I was really 
* 

interested" and "You learn a lot by doing and going over the other projects with friends." 

Students also were queried as to how much they felt their HSTA teachers encouraged them 
to “explore their ideas.” This question is critical to HSTA programming, because student interest 
is paramount to HSTA club attendance. The mean response was 4.3. Almost one-half of the 
students’ justifications could be collapsed into this reason: The teachers encouraged and 
supported them through giving guidance and assistance with the decision making process in the 
exploration of their ideas. Such speaks to the paradigm shift explicit in science education reform, 
which HSTA attempts to realize: from teacher directed to student centered learning. 

Special Top ics Graduate Course 

To date, evaluation data are available only for the Spring, 1996, graduate course offerings 
that dovetail with HSTA teachers’ responsibilities as facilitators of HSTA community 
programming. Ten teachers finished the course, and seven of them completed and returned by 
mail to OHSR a course evaluation questionnaire that was adapted from the standard university 
(WVU) course evaluation tool. Four of the teachers rated the course “excellent” and three rated the 
course “good” (other choices were satisfactory, fair, and poor). An important addition to this tool 
was the question: To what extent did the course contribute to your professional development? 
Given the choices “not at all,” “somewhat,” “moderate extent,” and “great extent,” all 7 teachers 
chose the latter. Five teachers provided reasons to support their rating, and each reason spoke to 
qualities and outcomes desired by HSTA staff. One reason was quite comprehensive: “I learned a 
great deal from participating in HSTA, both about the health science fields and about our specific 
health-related project. I have met a lot of new people and gained a lot of resource materials and 
personnel.” 





275 



Other teachers stated that the course "went along with what we were actually doing with 
students" or was an "incentive to keep trying when we have one of those periodic HSTA meetings 
that makes you wonder if you are having an effect on the students." One just put it like this: "I 
feel that I as well as my kids in HSTA have changed from a "frog" to a "prince".” 

When asked to provide other comments, including those pertaining to course improvement, 
only one individual cited an improvement: More workshops. Other questions solicited directly the 
teachers’ satisfaction with the instructor’s written communication, teaching, and knowledge, and 
are not dealt with in this paper. 

Conclusions 

HSTA provides a special opportunity for teachers to “make a difference” in the future lives 
of underrepresented students, and gain extensive professional development in doing so. Through 
facilitating extracurricular science clubs, these teachers make possible science and math enrichment 
for students as well as the opportunity to learn more about and experience through shadowing 
careers in the health sciences. 

Broadly, HSTA makes important contributions to the National Education Goals (America 
2000, 1991)— to be first in the world in math and science and to provide professional development 
for educators. More specifically, HSTA facilitates the realization of the National Science Education 
Siafldard? as they pertain to teaching, professional development, content, program and system. 
Examples of related HSTA thrusts include a primary emphasis on learning science through inquiry, 
access to community and university resources (including “the medical establishment”) that extend 
the school science program beyond the “walls” of the school, extended investigations that nurture a 
community of learners, increased emphasis on the teacher as a member of a professional collegial 
community and as a source and facilitator of change, and equity of science education opportunities 
for underrepresented youth. 

The provision of science and math enrichment to underrepresented youth (many from rural 
areas) through “after school” programming represents a major challenge, and teachers are the most 
important learning resource in this endeavor. Therefore, it is significant that teachers evaluate 




276 



highly community-based HSTA programming to date and find personal meaning and benefit in 
their involvement, and that the latter includes the application of knowledge and skills gained from 
HSTA to their regular science classroom. Anticipated applications of communication technology 
(e.g., video conferencing and HSTA club home pages) should contribute further to collaboration 
amongst HSTA teachers, students, and faculty in higher education.

MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE TEACHING PROJECT BASED UPON 
INFUSION OF NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURE 

Paul B. Otto, University of South Dakota 

Introduction 

Imagine a television news broadcast interrupted with a bulletin announcing that a vehicle 
from outer space has landed in a remote area in Yellowstone Park. Individuals with skin color and 
facial features not familiar to us have stepped out and, through a sophisticated language conversion 
device, have been able to communicate with people in the surrounding area. 

The foreign individuals appear friendly and seem genuinely interested in our people, 
customs and way of life. They have demonstrated superior weapons and various other forms of 
technology which have our military very worried. 

Soon the visitors have made it known that they would like to live here. A small group of 
senators travel from Washington, p. C. to confer with them. Almost immediately the senators are 
psychologically overwhelmed by the visitors’ advanced technology and the superiority of their 
weapons. In a ceremony in which an intoxicating milky liquid is served, the senators sign over 
100 square miles of Yellowstone National Park for the visitors to colonize. Numerous baubles of 
sophisticated software and hardware are bestowed upon the senators. All of the “gifts” are highly 
sophisticated by our standards, but are really considered outdated junk by the visitors. 

Almost immediately the colonization begins. Permanent structures become part of the 
landscape. A group of United States tourists wander into the visitors housing area and are 
destroyed by their security systems. The local national guard is called out and is immediately 
annihilated. Negotiations end with the ceding of the entire state of Wyoming, with the local 
residents being relocated into the Nevada desert. More visitors arrive from outer space and more 
territory is ceded. Soon, it is obvious, the entire country belongs to the visitors. It becomes futile 
to resist Occupants of the relocation centers lapse into a sense of hopelessness. Becoming 
inebriated with the white liquid becomes more and more a way of life for many.

The preceding scenario is a very dismal situation from our perspective. We were living in 
peace and harmony, and in a relatively short time, our lives were changed to an almost impossible 
situation. We were quickly subdued by superior numbers and an advanced technology. 

A parallel situation existed for Native Americans on the North American continent with the 
advent of the Europeans. These people were forced into reservations in geographic areas where it 
was impossible to sustain life. Clothing, food, and shelter were promised through treaty by our 
Federal Government, but delivery was often tentative and sporadic. People had no gainful 
employment and lost dignity and developed low self-concepts. The hopelessness of reservation life 
has led to many problems for Native American people. 



Project 



Purpose 

An Eisenhower supported project was implemented to improve the grades K-12, teaching 
of science and mathematics in the Tiospa Zina Tribal School (TZTS), Agency Village, South 
Dakota. The project activities were based on the infusion of the Native American culture, the 
utilization of hands-on science and mathematics techniques, the integration of science, 
mathematics, technology, and cooperative learning through: 

1 . A one-week summer inservice training workshop in the TZTS 

2. Eight inservice follow-up sessions during the 1994-95 academic year, and 

3 . Mail loan of science/mathematics materials from the USD Northern Plains Science/Mathematics 
Education Resource Center during 1994-95 academic year. 



Fo £ yg 



The summer institute and the follow-up inservice concentrated on faculty enhancement in Native 
American cultural background, faculty infusion of Native American culture into the teaching of 
science and mathematics, and enablement of indigenous students to make connections with their 
cultural roots and the learning of science and mathematics. 

Teachers designed and implemented activities in science and mathematics to facilitate the student

outcomes previously adopted by the TZTS: 

1 . Effective Communicators who demonstrate the ability to express themselves clearly in all 
aspects of life. 

2. Enlightened Representatives who incorporate principles of Dakota culture, modem and 
traditional values, and tribal affairs into their daily lives. 

3. Self Directed Achievers who formulate goals and priorities, and continuously evaluate their 
progress. 

4. Balanced individuals exhibiting sensitivity, self confidence, and respect, who model holistic 
lifestyles and are able to live in harmony with self, others, and Mother Earth. 

5. Creative thinkers who use a variety of techniques and resources to resolve challenges facing 
them. 

6. Global citizens who demonstrate respect for and acceptance of cultural diversity. 

Twenty science and mathematics and elementary teachers were involved in the Project. The 
teachers suggested the dates and meeting times for a one-week workshop in the TZTS during May 
30 - June 4, 1994, as well as eight inservice academic year meetings. 

Rationale 

Students view teachers as the single most important influence on their science attitudes 
(Westerback, 1982). Numerous professional organizations have set the direction for the teaching 
of mathematics and science. 

The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics advocates mathematics teaching which is 
student-centered, activity centered using technology and manipulatives, and is designed to promote 
higher level thinking and exploration. Mathematics students should be empowered to "analyze, 
reason, and comprehend." 

Both the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS, 1989) and the 
National Science Teachers Association (NSTA, 1992), advocated hands-on, inquiry-based 
teaching with students doing science. The National Science Foundation Statewide Systemic 
Initiative (NSF-SSI) project placed emphasis on the teaching of science and mathematics using 




281 



manipulatives, problem-solving-inquiry processes, infusing technology, integrating science, 
mathematics, language arts and social studies and the community. 

Evidence over the past three decades consistently verifies the efficacy of the activity/inquiry 
approach to teaching science. Meta-analyses of hundreds of experimental studies involving 
thousands of students indicate the hands-on inquiry curricula as superior to traditional curricula in 
achievement, reading readiness and skills of analysis, math, social studies, communication, and 
positive science attitude development. (Bredderman, 1983; Shymansky, et.al., 1983). 

The Tiospa Zina Tribal School (TZTS) consists primarily of Native American students. 
Present-day Native American students tend to either buy into the cultural values of the indigenous 
culture, buy into the values of the dominant society, function in both the indigenous culture and the 
dominant culture, or buy into neither. 

It appears that increasing numbers during the past decade buy into neither culture. Having 
little, if any, cultural roots from which to realize stability, these young people exist in flux, have a 
high probability of not realizing their potential, or at worst have a high potential of dropping out of 
society. If young Native Americans are not taught the values of the indigenous culture, there are 
serious implications that they lack knowledge and lack understanding and feel out of touch with 
reality, feel adrift and perhaps even ashamed to be "Indian." 

A Native American Adolescent Health Survey, administered during the spring of 1993, 
indicated that 53% of the TZTS Grades 6-12 students are emotionally insecure or unsure of self, 
find daily life uninteresting, and 61 % feel their family cares little about feelings. 

It seems reasonable to educate Native American students in their basic cultural heritage for 
maximum utilization to fit into the dominant society. Both Jewish and Asian cultures successfully 
maintain their strong cultural heritages while successfully integrating into the dominant society. 

The TZTS had previously derived a very pivotal Mission Statement which was quite 
complementary to the purpose of the project. As a broad vision statement, it encompassed all of 
the project ingredients throught the statement on the following page. 



O 

ERIC 



282 



To provide students of the Tiospa Zina Tribal School with educational opportunities 
which will prepare them to function in a multi-cultural and increasingly 
technological society while retaining their unique cultural heritage and identity. 

The proposed project focused on the indigenous stories from the past, which could be 
gleaned from the local community as well as sources of Native American writers, and used them as 
the basis for studying mathematics and science. Examples of excellent sources of Native American 
stories, and associated teaching suggestions are Native American Stories (Caduto & Bruchac, 
1991), Keepers of the Animals (Caduto & Bruchac, 1991), Keepers of the Earth (Caduto & 
Bruchac, 1989), and Earth’s Caretakers, Native American Lessons (lessons patterned after the 
Robert Karplus Learning Cycle), (Nyberg, 1993). 

Careful analysis of the traditional stories indicates a correspondence between them and the 
current theories of science and mathematics. Ecologists routinely warn us that our future health 
depends of the interrelationship between ourselves, our planet, and the plants and animals in our 
environment. The indigenous peoples viewed the natural world in balance with all things, 
including themselves, as part of a great circle. Humans were not more important than the rocks, the 
plants or the animals. In fact, it is not uncommon for them to be described as "ancestors" and for 
stories to include people becoming animals and animals becoming people. Therefore what was 
done to nature was done to a brother or sister. They emphasized a harmony with nature rather than 
control of nature. The people believed they were living with rather than on the place they called 
turtle island. If people became sick, it was viewed as an imbalance which must be restored. The 
Creator was ubiquitous requiring ceremonies and prayers which involved the sick person's entire 
community. "The old Lakota was wise. He knew that man's heart away from nature becomes 
hard. He knew that lack of respect for growing living things soon led to lack of respect for 
humans too." Chief Standing Bear, Oglala Sioux (Nyberg, 1993). 

The view of the "old Ones" is as apropos today as it was for centuries in the past. Michael 
J. Caduto emphasized this perspective: "We are in relationship with the Earth and other people. 
Doing good supports this relationship. Love and moral goodness are inseparable, they are the 





283 



elemental components of a life ethic." (Caduto, 1985). 

N. Scott Momaday stressed the importance of stories in the indigenous culture: "In his 
traditional world the Native American lives in the presence of stories. The storyteller is one whose 
spirit is indispensable to the people. — his object is most often the establishment of meaning. — 
stories tend to support and confirm our perceptions of the world and of the creatures within it. 

— The stories in the present collection center upon one of the most important of all considerations 
in human experience: the relationship between man and nature. In the Native American world this 
relationship is so crucial as to be definitive of the way in which man formulates his own best idea 
of himself. In the presence of these stories we have an affirmation of the human spirit.lt is a just 
and wondrous celebration.” (Selected parts of the Foreword by Momaday in Caduto & Bruchac, 
1989, p. xvii ) 

The intent of the project was not to teach Native American cultural values, but to instruct 
the teachers in utilizing Native American Cultural background and values in teaching mathematics 
and science. Much of Native American culture, such as the circle, the drum, the sweat lodge, etc., 
enter into the spiritual realm. Participants involved in the project activities were encouraged to 
exercise sensitivity in all lesson planning. 

AcRvjti.es 

Twenty K-12 teachers from the Tiospa Zina Tribal school attended a May 30 - June 4, 

1994 summer institute in the Tiospa Zina school. Participants elected 3-semester hours of graduate 
credit in the course Developing Hands-on/Inquiry-Based Mathematics Science Teaching Strategies, 
at no tuition cost 

Activities were conducted by the PI, professor of science education, an associate professor 
of Native American Studies (a Lakota speaker), and an assistant professor of Mathematics 
Education. Concentration was on problem solving thinking skills, cooperative learning, the use of 
manipulatives, and the integration of science/mathematics based upon stories and background of 
the Dakota culture.

The Native American studies professor developed background in Native American cultures 
which gave a theoretical perspective to the participants. He tied in specific generic teaching 
procedures for enhancing the learning of Native American students. 

The mathematics education professor worked with the mathematics teachers in developing 
the use of manipulatives in the teaching of mathematics. Tenets of the NCTM Standards were 
incorporated. 

Science education activities were the responsibility of the PI. He also was responsible for 
planning of the activities and gave special effort to coordinate Native American cultural infusion 
and the integration of science, mathematics, and technology. In response to a teacher bringing in 
several milk cases of Native American resources available from the school and the personal 
libraries of the faculty, the PI urged the high school principal to have the titles, authors, and 
location of the materials entered into a computer data base for easy sorting and access. The 
information was entered into a spreadsheet which at least makes them easily accessible, but does 
not have the sorting capabilities offered in a data base. 

The summer institute activities were based on the Jean Piaget cognitive developmental 
theories through the Learning Cycle developed by the late Robert Karplus. Experimental evidence 
has demonstrated the efficacy of the Learning Cycle which is endorsed by the Council for 
Elementary Science International (CESi). The Learning Cycle consists of three sequential steps; 
Exploration, Concept Introduction, & Concept Application. Each participant planned a Learning 
Cycle lesson incorporated with a Native American component, and in turn, taught the lesson to the 
group, followed by a group critique. 

Project Learning Tree and Project Wild were introduced to the group with personal copies 
provided each participant. Each of these environmental educational sources contains lessons 
incorporating Native American culture with the study of science and environmental issues. The 
participants were also involved in activities from Project AIMS (Activities for Integrating 
Mathematics & Science).

During the 1994-95 academic year, eight, four-hour, inservice sessions were conducted in 
the TZTS on a Monday afternoon. Classes were dismissed in the school for staff development 
activities for the project as well as outside the project. New materials and activities were 
introduced, and the participants shared lessons they had taught and classroom experiences as well 
as problems and successes they encountered. Participants were asked to design at least two 
Learning Cycle lessons each month and teach them to their classes. The lessons were 
demonstrated during the sessions and critiques were given as to the efficacy of their lessons with 
their students. Questions were fielded from the other participants. 

Evaluation; An Overview 

Analysis of both the summer institute survey of participants’ perceptions as well as that 
done on the survey of the academic year activities reflected high participant satisfaction. The 
predominance of participants viewed the experiences as being quite valuable. 

Sixteen of the 20 participants completed the University credit requirements. Four of the 
individuals fell behind in their assignments and received incompletes at the end of project activities. 
One individual had been involved in a Master of Arts program and was able to complete the degree 
requirements during the project year. This individual asked the PI to serve as her major advisor. 

As a result of the program, the TZTS became interested in functioning as a Professional 
Development Center (PDC). During the spring of 1995 a contractual agreement was reached 
between the TZTS and the University of South Dakota. Two TZTS teachers were released from 
classroom duties to serve as mentors for two PDC teachers. Both the mentors and the PDC 
teachers were enrolled in graduate programs. Graduate courses were offered in the PDC with non- 
PDC teachers as well as PDC personnel enrolled in the graduate courses and graduate programs. 
One mentor teacher, the same person who completed her Master of Arts program as an advisee of 
the PI, is completing a doctoral program. Mentors were also involved in inservice work and 
curricular and program improvement in their school as well as being involved in mentoring the 
PDC teachers.

The superintendent of the TZTS is keenly interested in curricular development as well as 
staff development. He has been instrumental in the development of a curriculum guide, based on 
Outcome Based Education, which had been designed with considerable emphasis on educating the 
whole student in becoming a well adjusted, productive citizen, able to function in modem society 
while maintaining cultural roots. It is his desire to have all of the teachers in the system to earn 
masters degrees or above. It appears that the project described in this article has been of benefit to 
a number of teachers in this school system who are postured to utilize their experiences for the 
benefit of their students. A number have completed advanced degrees. The project has also been a 
mechanism to stimulate the faculty and administration toward further staff enhancement.

POLICY ISSUES IN FLORIDA TEACHER EDUCATION - ROLE AND IMPACT 
OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION CONSORTIUM FOR MATHEMATICS AND 
SCIENCE

Science and History 

The Florida Higher Education Consortium for Mathematics and Science 

If systemic reforms of science and mathematics teaching and learning are to occur, leaders at 
all educational levels and community leaders must develop new structures to guide and support the 
change efforts (AAHE, 1994; Haycock, 1994). College faculty must accept and personalize 
constructive change in inquiry-based communities (Halpem, 1994; Project Kaleidoscope, 1991; 
Tobias, 1992). 

In Florida new organizational structures have been created to involve higher education faculty 
in working with one another and with their preK-12 colleagues. The Florida Higher Education 
Consortium for Mathematics and Science (HEC) is a virtual center composed of state universities, 
community colleges, private colleges and universities and other entities in six geographical regions 
corresponding to the Florida Department of Education organizational structure. 

Since Fall 1993, the HEC has received funds from the Florida NSF/State Systemic Initiative 
and the Postsecondary Eisenhower program (federal flow through dollars). In addition, the HEC 
has aligned its efforts with the Southeast Regional Eisenhower Laboratory (SERVE), the Florida 
Postsecondary Education Planning Commission (PEPC), and the Florida Institute of Education 
(FIE). A steering committee consisting of a chair, six regional representatives, and other agency 
representatives has served as the policy board for the HEC. Figure 1 elucidates the HEC 
organizational structure. 

HEC activities occur regionally and statewide, with the past statewide meeting and the 
projected 1997 meeting occurring in conjunction with the Conference on College Teaching and 
Learning, an international meeting hosted by Florida Community College at Jacksonville. The 
HEC continues to evolve and expand into an entity which encourages communication, strategic 
planning, research and evaluation. While new community college, college, and university 
members are actively recruited, the HEC facilitates meetings between higher education and 
elementary/secondary teachers and administrators at both the regional and statewide levels. HEC

sessions have been presented at the statewide science and mathematics teachers’ meetings. 



Goals of the HEC 

Four goals and a mission statement were established at the December 1993 HEC meeting at 
University of Central Florida in Orlando. These have been refined and expanded, with 
corresponding activities and expected outcomes. The stated mission of the HEC is to serve to 
facilitate communication among higher education institutions as a basis for enhancing mathematics 
and science teaching and learning. Goals and sample activities are as follows: 

Goal 1 : Continue to establish HEC as a viable, virtual center that works to enhance mathematics 
and science education. 

A representative steering committee has operated since Fall 1993 to guide HEC activities. 

The composition reflects mathematics and science at university, college, and community college 
levels. 

Goal 1 Sample Activities 

1 . Refine communications among institutions and between HEC and local, state, and national 
policy makers; explore ways to strengthen collaborative relationships which support the 
comprehensive goals of systemic reform. 

2. Facilitate professional development opportunities for HEC members, especially those which 
focus on reconceptualizing teaching and learning science and mathematics at the post-secondary 
level; include distance technologies. 

Goal 2: Enhance the utilization of educational programs and resources. 

The HEC is dedicated to enhancing the quality and cost-effectiveness of relevant programs 
by sharing resources and ideas. 

Goal 2 Sample Activities 

1 . Identify programs and models that reflect HEC goals. Develop a clearinghouse and database of 
relevant information/expertise. 

2. Work with other HEC members, school districts, and informal learning centers to share, 
resources and educational programs of merit. 

Goal 3: Reconceptualize and restructure teacher education bv developing models that meet the 
unique needs of educational communities. 

The HEC is working with the Florida Department of Education and the Florida Education 



O

291 



311 



Standards Commission to conceptualize and implement effective approaches to teacher 
development. 

Goal 3 Sample Activities 

1 . Study and discuss the Mathematics and Science preK- 1 2 Curriculum Frameworks and 
Sunshine State Standards, the Science Teacher Development Framework, the Educational 
Standards Commission Educator Accomplished Practices, national-level science and mathematics 
standards documents, and other relevant reform documents, including innovative teacher 
preparation and enhancement models; focus on deep analysis of pedagogical and content issues, 
including science and mathematics courses/experiences and field experiences. 

2. Sensitize the higher education community to the critical need to address diversity and equity in 
teacher education models, including recruitment and retention issues. 

3. Take an active role in the establishment of teacher education policy, i.e. certification, FTE 
requirements, accreditation, etc. 

Goal 4: Evaluate the systemic impact of HEC on the enhancement of mathematics and science 
teaching and learning at state, regional, and local levels. 

The Research and Evaluation Task Force of the HEC is constructing a model for evaluating 
systemic change based on systems theory. 

Goal 4 Sample Activities 

1 . Develop and implement an ongoing mechanism to evaluate the activities of HEC. 

2. Provide interactive forums to discuss HEC research and evaluation plans and results and to 
partner in the development of a statewide research agenda. 

Area Centers for Educational Enhancement 

In summer 1996, all HEC Eisenhower funding was included under the umbrella of a new 
Florida DOE initiative, the Area Centers for Educational Enhancement (ACEE), funded at a 
maximum of $600,000 per center including approximately $260,000 which must be administered 
by a higher education institution. These centers serve all school districts in their respective regions 
and model a k-16 educational continuum. Figure 2 depicts the geography and lead institutions of 
the six Florida Area Centers for Educational Enhancement. 

A Regional Example 

An example is the following. Twenty school districts are in the northeast Florida “Crown”

region (Region II) and are represented by the the Northeast Florida Educational Consortium, which 
serves as the preK-12 fiscal agent for the ACEE. The higher education institution serving as the 
regional coordinating HEC Center (University of North Florida) has committed to continuing HEC 
activities by working closely with the Crown Region ACEE and all ten colleges, universities and 
community colleges in the region. It functions as an interdisciplinary center which links faculty 
efforts in the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Education. 

Regional Steering Committee 

A steering committee consisting of the Deans of the two colleges and representatives of 
relevant departments and a core group of Region 13 HEC members guide intra and inter institutional 
collaboration. Faculty are supported for their efforts which include reforms in science and 
mathematics and science and mathematics education courses and programs. Since these reforms 
are major goals of HEC, this center serves as a model for other higher education institutions in the 
Crown Region. The presence of the HEC center and its relationships to other institutions of higher 
education and school districts in the region catalyze efforts to secure other federal, state and private 
sector funding. 

Regional Teacher Enhancement Model 

NEFEC and the Region II HEC have developed a Teacher Enhancement Model which aligns 
school district resources and involves both district personnel and college faculty in district training 
teams and preservice teacher education program development (See Figure 3). 

HEC Policy Issues 

While HEC has been instrumental in planning and participating in science and mathematics teacher 
education reforms, a number of questions must be addressed if policy changes are to occur and 
endure over time. These questions will inform the proposed research and evaluation activities of 
the Florida HEC. 

Challenging Questions 

The questions are as follows: 

• Who are the members of HEC and how representative is it of the various entities which need to 
be involved in effective teacher education reform? What incentives keep HEC members actively 
involved in regional and state level activities? 

• Who are HEC’s major partners and how have relationships progressed?

• How have HEC members become partners in preparing teachers and determining national and 
state standards-based criteria for program design and accreditation? 

• How is HEC addressing the need to include more under represented groups in science and 
mathematics education? 

• How have HEC members provided support for the articulation between K-12 education and 
higher education? 

• How is the HEC planning and implementing research and evaluation plans? For example: 

How is the ACEE/HEC model functioning? What are the indicators used to judge its 
effectiveness? How much variation occurs in ACEE/HEC models among regions? How are 
diversity in design and commonality in purpose sustained? 

•How has HEC become involved in inter institutional distance learning? 

HEC as Case Study 

The HEC has adopted the mission to facilitate communication and improve teaching and 
learning in Florida by focusing on inter institutional collaboration. It engages in alignment, 
analysis, and action. With a statewide database of more than 500 members and even more 
members active at the regional levels, HEC has focused the energies of Florida faculty on areas of 
common interest, both institutionally and personally. Through shifts in policy and funding at the 
state level, HEC continues to endure and grow. Lessons learned continue to provide engaging 
challenges for Florida educators. The Florida story is a case study of potential use to other states 
engaged in the meaningful reform of science and mathematics education.

COMPARING TEACHING PRACTICE WITH STUDENT OUTCOME 
KNOWLEDGE: AN ASSESSMENT OF MID-LEVEL 
CONSTRUCTIVIST LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS 



Lawrence B. Flick, Oregon State University

Problem 

Inquiry-oriented instruction is complex requiring teacher expertise, appropriate materials, 
and cooperation of students. Research on inquiry-oriented instruction has focused more on student 
behaviors and their connection to a variety of learning outcomes than it has on the behavior of 
teachers and how they establish and maintain inquiry-oriented instruction (Romberg & Carpenter, 
1986; Reid & Hodson, 1987). Empirical studies of student learning in inquiry contexts often 
highlight positive exemplars that show the possibilities of inquiry as an instructional model (Roth 
& Roychoudhury, 1993). These examples have been tantalizing and inspiring but leaves us 
wondering what the teacher is doing (Hofstein & Lunetta, 1982). This knowledge raises the 
question of how teachers operating in typical classrooms generate inquiry-oriented learning 
environments? Equally important is how do all of the students in a classroom, no just interesting 
exemplars, interpret and react to this type of instruction? 

Given the constructivist-based, inquiry-oriented instruction promoted by the National 
Science Education Standards (NRC, 1996), a major challenge in science education is to develop 
comprehensive theory about the behavior of teachers and students in classrooms that implement 
recommended practice. The popular view of successful teaching envisions well-planned, 
smoothly-executed lessons that culminate in anticipated student behaviors that meet pre-planned 
objectives. However, expertise in teaching is perhaps more appropriately characterized by how the 



teacher manages divergence and impediments to planned instruction (Sternberg & Horvath, 1995; 
Hammer, 1997). Teaching is an ongoing intellectual challenge requiring teachers to reflect on 
content, adjust pace, probe individual students, and even change instructional objectives while they 
are teaching a lesson (Tobin & Fraser, 1990; Tobin, Kahle, & Fraser, 1990). 

A more fluid, realistic, real-time view of instruction is more difficult to track and to 
document. Understanding the dynamics of the everyday classroom under the influence of a 
complex form of instruction requires studying the relationship of many people, their knowledge, 
beliefs, and intentions. Investigating deep questions about classroom contexts usually suggests 
broad based, qualitative research techniques. This study used the context of a broad based 
intervention in elementary and middle level science teaching to document several aspects of 
instruction from a documentation of teaching practice to students outcomes. 

Purpose 

This is study is derived from the evaluation component of an NSF-funded project entitled: 
Integrated Science Concepts (ISC). The purpose of the study was to assess student knowledge 
that resulted from differential implementation of constructivist-based, inquiry-oriented teaching 
practices demonstrated during ISC workshops. Because the specific nature of instructional 
practice was left to the discretion of each teacher, data were also collected concerning individual 
teacher beliefs and teaching practices with respect to constructivist teaching. 

Subjects 

Three middle level teachers and one 5th grade teacher were selected from those participating 
in ISC. Teacher selection was based on criteria derived from observations during ISC workshops, 
from lesson plans and journals required by the project, and from video tapes of classroom teaching 
taken after the summer workshops. These data were used to select teachers who represented a 
range of teaching skills with respect to the constructivist objectives of ISC (see Table 1). 
Observations of teaching and assessment of workshop participation involved high inference 
techniques. Specific teaching practices were not the focus of workshops nor was constructivist 
teaching operationalized by ISC in such a way that specific observation criteria could be applied in

classrooms. Consequently, judgments made in selecting teachers were based on subjective criteria 
derived from familiarity with the research literature on constructivist teaching, workshop content, 
and the teachers themselves. Ranking by observation criteria is reported because it reveals a 
interesting disparity with the ranking by Constructivist Learning Environment Survey (CLES) 
(Enochs & Riggs, 1990) scores collected in July. 

Each teacher used their own judgment to select approximately six students for interviewing. 
Selection criteria was that the student sample provide a cross section of conceptual understanding 
of the science subject matter and an even distribution between males and females. Teachers also 
estimated which students would be most willing to voluntarily participate in these interviews and 
therefore provide the maximum amount of information (see Table 2).

Methods 

Teachers participated in two, 45-minute interviews conducted by different external 
evaluators. Both were conducted at the end of the year after incorporating recommended practices. 
Both interviews elicited discussion of beliefs about teaching related to constructivist practice. The 
first interview focused on teacher understanding of specific science knowledge presented as a part 
of the summer workshops conducted nine months earlier and a general assessment of what 
students learned as a result of teaching a portion of that content. The second interview focused on 
a validation of their responses to the CLES and a discussion of specific teaching practices. 

The six teachers collaborated with the two evaluators in the design of interview protocols 
used with members of their class whom they selected. The audio-taped interview, conducted 
during school time lasted from 20 to 30 minutes. Simple classroom materials used during 



instruction prompted student thinking about science concepts. All interviews were conducted in 
work rooms near the student’s classroom. 

Students are identified by a four character code: (a) a letter identifies the classroom, (b) a 
number signifies the student within a classroom, (c) M or F identifies gender, and (d) H, M, or L 
identifies academic achievement level of this student as judged by the teacher. For instance, J4MH 
identifies Jenks’ classroom, student #4, male, and ranked as “high” in academic achievement. 
Analysis of all transcripts were completed before teacher rankings were known by the researchers. 

The interviews were organized around topics chosen by the teachers as those most closely 
aligned with the content of project inservice activities. During planning meetings with each 
teacher, through phone calls, and electronic mail conversations, each teacher outlined specific 
aspects of content around which we designed the interview questions. There was no external 
validation of the interview content nor external check for the reliability of interview protocol. The 
interview format was piloted during year 1 of the ISC project that provided the practice necessary 
for reliable delivery of target questions and follow-up probes. We observed at least one class and 
one video tape taught by each teacher on the science topic of the student interview. These 
observations were compared with descriptions of teaching practice and statements of belief 
collected in teacher interviews. These observations also facilitated understanding the nature of 
content as seen by students. The teachers also discussed materials used during instruction from 
which we selected prompts for each set of interviews. 

Results 

Transcripts of teacher interviews along with direct and video taped observations of teaching 
were used to characterize each teacher’s view of constructivist teaching and to describe teaching 
practice. Discrepancies between teacher description and observed practice are noted and discussed. 
Interview data established instructional objectives for the segment of instruction that formed the 
basis for direct observations. Each teacher was required to select one of the topics from the 
summer workshops and include it the curriculum the following year. Interview data from selected 
students were used to assess the extent to which the teacher met stated objectives.

Ms. Jenks. Grade 7 



View of ConstructivisfTeaching . Jenks treats student ideas and student talk with a high 
degree of respect. She believes it is important to generate student ideas about a topic before 
formally teaching in order to structure further instruction and to foster student thinking. Student 
expression is encouraged throughout instruction by varying instructional strategies and providing 
opportunities for student expression. She also recognizes limitations in divergent teaching 
strategies. 

I would say my class, what I think what I wish would happen doesn't always 
happen.. . .see what kinds of things they know, sometimes, we do a warm-up thing every 
day where they have a couple of questions that sort of settle them when they come in, they 
have something to do. Some of those are review from what we've done before, but as I go 
into a new unit I often use them to just see where they're thinking, and it's definitely a 
group picture. I use that, and it really only gets those people who will respond. 

She described how she employs text-based material and worksheets to explicitly instruct 
students on a particular topic. She feels that this is a comfortable and secure mode for some 
students and for those who are not responding, this is one way of getting some response to 
specific content. Time- and energy-intensive forms of constructivist practice must also be balanced 
by text-based, explicit forms of teaching as a fail-back position just to survive the job from day to 
day. 

Teaching Objectives . As part of a broader, year long emphasis on form and function, 
students were expected to describe the relationship between form and function in bird beaks, 
wings, and feet. Students were also expected to speculate on the function of natural and 
manufactured objects based on personally generated analogies to the appearance or form of the 
objects. For instance, while holding a piece of tree fungus, students were expected to generate an 
analogy of form (e.g. It looks like a thick leaf) and speculate about its function based on that 
analogy.

Teaching Practice . Ms. Jenks is an active teacher. She moves throughout the room of 35 



students interacting with the class even when the presentation is based on an overhead 
transparency. Observed methods included open-ended questions for which she would try to get 
multiple responses. Student ideas were solicited by an opening activity designed to probe their 
current knowledge. During one observation, students were asked to draw their favorite bird as a 
prelude to a discussion of form and function of different parts of bird anatomy. While it was not 
clear just what previous knowledge they would draw upon to recall the features of a favorite bird, 
it was clear that students were exercising their general knowledge of bird appearance. This was 
followed by direct observation of bird feathers using a jeweler’s loop and one of two microscopes. 
Students were prompted for specific observations. She kept the pace of classes quick to fit the 
schedule and student interest thus limiting the number of students who could respond to any one 
point. She worked at bringing closure to lessons sometimes at the expense of dispensing with the 
investigative thread of instruction and conducting a review of specific observations or main points. 

Student Knowledge . Each student protocol was assessed by a rubric that treated each 
follow-up question as an additional prompt. The fewer prompts needed to stimulate discussion 
relevant to the current content topic in the interview the higher the student was evaluated. The 
same rubric was applied to the George interviews in that the content and grade levels were the 
same. The rubric for the content portion of the protocol was as follows: 

1 . High - Student mentioned both structures and functions in birds in at least two contexts 
with only the initial question as a prompt. 

2. Medium - Student tended to mention functions only with references to structures 
included only after specific verbal prompting. Combined references to structures and functions 
after prompting would not be sufficient to warrant a “high” rating unless the references were in at 
least two completely different contexts. 

3. Low - Student tended to mention functions only with minimal references to structures 
included only after specific verbal prompting. A response was judged minimal when it appeared to 
repeat hint provided in the prompting questions. 




303 




Two students out of the six interviewed in Jenks class were ranked “high” in knowledge 
because they readily linked structure and function without the need for specific prompting. The 
student whose response is used for this sample discussed structure and function 10 times during 
his interview. In this response, he discusses a class activity that asked students to relate the 
structure of household tools with the function of bird beaks. 

J2MM: The beak shapes, there's we had a station thing where one, there's like a thing full 
of water with Styrofoam and they had to use like three different kind of things to see which 
one was the best used. It was like the strainer because it could just pick it right up out of 
the water and the water would go up. 

In this next sample, he comments on the wings, feet, and beak of predator birds in pictures 
presented during the interview (see Figures 1 & 2). The one named as a “tamagan” is being 
attacked by a hawk (see Figure 1). 

J2MM: Ya. It looks like it should be like a quick flyer and it's got talons so it can like pick 
up things pretty easy. It's four-toed and there's a toe in the back so it can pick it up. It's a 
good ripper, so it's a meat eater. The one right next to it looks like it's a tamagan or 
anything like that. It looks like it should be a quick take-off because they get into trouble 
with other larger birds and it looks like it walks around on it's feet because it doesn't look 
like it has strong toes. It's only got three it looks like. It must just walk around usually 
unless it's attacked. 

The next example is the only student out of six interviews that was ranked “low” in student 
knowledge. Note that she recalled the key phrase from the instruction: “form follows function.” 
However, beyond the first statement, she was only able to relate form to function with prompting. 
She also had considerable trouble generating descriptive language for other parts of the bird. Note 
also by the “H” designation on her identifier that she was selected as a representative as a “high” 
achieving student by the teacher. 

J5FH: Well we talked about form follows function, about how their beaks are formed for 
what they eat, and owls to rip and tear flesh, like little mice and stuff. 




325 



304 



I: ... tell me about the birds in this picture, just by what you can see? 

J5FH: They look like they hunt very well. Their claws look like they crush the animal. 
They fly down and grab it and kill it. And their beaks look like they could rip it very well. 
I: What in particular about the beaks that make you think that? 

J5FH: They're kind of hooked. The top are. And also their feathers are very sleek so he 
can fly very fast. 

I: Any differences between the one of the left and the one on the right. . .? 

J5FH: This one looks a little bigger, tail feather... Their head shapes look a little different. 
I: And how different? In what ways? 

J5FH: Well like that . . . just like um , that one looks smaller. 

When asked to comment on a selection of materials used in class to generate discussion 
about structure and function, she had trouble commenting on anything other than what the item 
looked like. 

J5FH: Well like this is part of a bee hive, like the honey comb part, dried up and stuff. 
J5FH: Pine cone. (Prompt) Yeah it feeds birds, these little things on it, they pick out and 
stuff. 

Mr. George. Grade 7 

View of Constructivist Teaching . George’s classroom is populated with live animals, such 
as two foot iguana, large boa constrictor, rabbits, and guinea pigs. These animals did not play a 
direct role in any of the observed lessons, but students were highly interested in their presence. 

The animals are expression George’s belief that children should be physically and emotionally 
connected to what they study. 

A room without animals to me would just I can't imagine what it would be like. Because 
they are kids, that's just an automatic connectedness. ...When they say wow, this is not a 
classroom, this is a zoo ya know, well that makes me feel good. That means this is a place 
where they would like to come. . . .On the other hand you have the negatives if the iguana

326 



says he's gonna go to the bathroom when you really feel like you’re ...really 
working. . .that stops. You have to wait so the animals can take the class away from you 
anytime they want, it's there. 

George feels a tension between opening the class to questioning and exploration and 
guiding students in their work. Students have opportunities to express their ideas but the science 
content forms the structure of the class. 

I'm doing this constructivist thing where I'm starting to see where they start from and I try 
to build on that. Once we get going on that I guess the main things that I try to do that I 
feel are important, first of all I feel reading and the content area in science is far different 
than the reading they do in other areas. I try to teach them the tricks early on of how to do 
that, of how to read slowly. Then I do a lot of concept and nature mapping. .. .1 do a lot of 
that and as far as introducing material, sometimes we read it, sometimes we brain storm it. 
When asked if he involved students in helping plan the content of lessons his reply was: 

. .I’ll give them choices sometimes and the problem with that is it’s hard to direct their learning 
when they don’t know the choices.” He feels strongly that students should be expressing what 
they know and what they want to know. He has developed some specific practices that now form 
routines for eliciting their ideas. These were in place before the ISC project but have been treated 
somewhat differently in his attempt to focus on student ideas. Through concept mapping, students 
should understand that there are numerous ways information can be organized and should 
appreciate points of view offered by other students. 

Teaching Objectives . George used the topic of form and function of bird beaks, wings, 
and feet as part of a larger unit on the study of wetlands. Using observations and data collected 
from a field trip to a local wetland area, students were expected to create four or more classes from 
the 50 species of birds observed on the wetlands trip. The basis for the groupings was to be based 
on function. They then had to identify a common set of wings, feet, and beaks for each group. 
Their final product was to be a mind-map or poster that showed a classification of wetland birds 



306 



327 



with a description of what they do (function) and drawings of common wings, beaks, and feet that 
are in each function group (form). 

Teaching Practice . A typical class opens with a warm-up question on the overhead, for 
instance, What is a wetland? What features does it have? Students take notes and a brief 
discussion follows. The notes go into their notebooks for future reference and for use in mind 
mapping exercises. The main activity is connected to the warm-up questions by a statement such 
as, “We will be working on a concept of wetland.” In the observed lesson he discussed the 
difference between your ‘concept’ of wetland and a dictionary definition. “Yours is more lengthy 
and will change to accept new information. You will construct a concept like building a house. 
You know in general about a house but not what a construction worker knows. Some of your 
ideas are misconceptions.” 

A brainstorming activity involved two student note takers at two chalkboards alternately 
writing down each idea presented by the class. In this case they were getting ready to go on the 
wetlands field trip. George distributed legal sized sheets of paper with a category marked at each 
end. “What you know” was on left and “What you want to know” was on right. In the middle 
students developed a concept or “mind” map. The brainstorming procedure lasted nearly 15 
minutes and became very repetitive. When students finished their list of what they knew about 
wetlands and were asked for what they want to know many of the same points showed up only 
this time they are stated as questions. For example, students knew that there are many different 
kinds of birds in wetland areas but wanted to know what kinds of birds they were. He allowed 
this process to proceed completely unmediated. A mind mapping activity that occurred on a 
different day employed a long list of topics generated from the brainstorm. Classroom 
observations of students notes showed that listed items for what they knew and what they want to 
know often look the same. George moved around the room actively engaging students in brief 
discussion about their maps and prodding several to include more information. 

Student Knowledge . Students saw many examples of birds through the wetlands study. 
This student exhibited a “high” level of knowledge based on the rubric discussed above for Jenks.

He easily related structure and function through recall of a humming bird example as well as by 
observing the pictures of a hawk and falcon used as prompts for the interview. 

G5MH: For instance, like the hummingbird, if I saw a beak that was real long, slender, 
that type of thing, I'd figure it was meant for poking into holes or something and getting 
food from there. 

G5MH: Well this one here looks like a hawk and it's got the long talons and the sharp 
beak with the curve on it. You can tell that it'll eat other animals and other birds. 

G5MH: That the bird is designed for catching and ripping up and eating prey. You can 
also tell by the build of the bird that it's used for soaring and it's able to fly long distances. 
Three students were ranked “low” mainly as a result of minimal response. It was difficult 
to tell whether this was from low motivation or lack of understanding. The first example is a 
response to comparing the hawk and falcon pictures (see Figures 1 & 2). 

I: I'm gonna ask you to look at a couple pictures. By looking at these birds, could you tell 
me something about what they do? 

G6FH: They fly, they have wings and there are lots of kinds of birds. 

I: . . .If you look at them like their beaks or their wings or their feet, can you assume 
something about how it lives, what it does? 

G6FH: Like if a bird has like-we did this activity in class and we had to-we used like nets 
and chopsticks to see how birds-what kind of birds has which beaks and what it does. I 
don't really know much about like what it does. 

I: . . .if you looked at this beak, would that beak suggest anything in particular about what 
this bird is able to do or what it does in it's life? 

G6FH: I have no idea. 

I: Okay, anything about the feet? Have you looked at its feet here? 

G6FH: Maybe they catch little insects, or maybe the climb, I don't know.

In this second example, the student would not respond to the questions in terms of 
structure and function but seemed to be trying to identify the names of each bird. 

I: If you looked at a bird and just by looking at say it's beak, it's wing, could you tell me 
something about that bird even if you didn't know the bird? 

G7FM: I don't know, I Could probably take a guess at it, but it’d probably take me a long 
time to actually understand what the bird is. 

I: . . .by examining these, what could you tell me about these birds just by looking at their 
pictures? 

G7FM: These look like they're feisty and they look like somewhat colorful. I don't know 
if I’ve seen that bird before. It's gray, brown and white. These birds over here, this looks 
like a hawk. It has some..., gray, brown, and white. 

G7FM: Lets see, this is kind of like water, close over here some type of seagull. 

G7FM: I guess if I had studied birds more then I would tell. This one by the way it’s head 
goes and it's pointed it looks like a hawk. The seagulls have big eyes and that's why I was 
guessing this one. 

Mr. Davidson. Grade 5 

View of Constructivist Teaching . Davidson expressed a sincere interest in helping students 
explore a topic based on their own developing knowledge. However, his view suggests that a 
constructivist teacher does not give information to students. Rather, the teacher helps students ask 
questions and guides their activity toward obtaining an answer. This generated concern that there 
was no way to assess what students were learning other than by listening to their questions and 
observing their activity. The following excerpt captures the essence of Davidson’s perspective. 

Well I see myself not telling the facts, not giving them information only as a springboard to 
question. I think that was the basic difference in what I was teaching before and how I was 
teaching. . . .What I really liked about the constructive point of view was to let the kids kind 



of lead in their questioning and then going and creating a curriculum about, what their 
questions were. I like that approach because then they are involved. Then you're taking 
what they're interested in and what their questions are and trying to create an atmosphere 
where they can find out on their own. So there's a lot of things I resisted. One thing I 
resisted was the open-endedness of no closure on a lesson. It bothered me for a long time 
this year. There’s no closure, there's no way of testing this, there's no other way of 
knowing other than just by what the kids are saying. ... So that required me to really redo a - 
lot of testing approach, how do I know. 

The omission of closure and withholding information did not represent the intent of the ISC 
workshops. However, discussion with project staff suggested that this point of view does had 
some basis in experience if one is overly focused on the personal knowledge construction 
philosophy behind the demonstrated teaching practices. 

Teaching Objectives . Davidson’s teaching objectives were quite consistent with his view 
of teaching. “Students will learn the importance of observation by drawing a picture of what they 
think a snail looks like and one picture of actually observing the snail. Students will learn to keep 
records by recording observations in a snail folder and tracking speed of snail on at least 3 runs. 
Students will learn to write down in the folder habits of the snail (eating, types of food, mating, 
speed of snail - all habits).” These lesson objectives were supplemented with notes on the nature 
of science and constructing reality (e.g. “observing and questioning, hypothesizing - 
reconstructing reality, making meaningful connections with whys and hows”). 

Teaching Practice . Davidson exhibits the warmth of a father-figure during his instruction. 
Slow to anger and with a smooth voice, he conducts an informal class with clear expectations for 
student behavior. His science instruction was modeled almost completely after the activities 
presented in the ISC workshops. Instruction was typically organized around the process of 
observing and producing written descriptions. He begins a science class by having students write 
down questions they have as a result of thinking about the topic from previous lessons. 




310 



We will be making new observations that you have never made before. Write down 

t 

questions about snails. ...We don’t know anything about the inside of a snail - write 

questions about inside of a snail. 

After students retrieved their snails, a common teaching behavior was to circulate around 
the room and prompt students to write down their observations. He reinforced this activity by 
probing students for what kinds of questions they had, in this case about snails, and repeating 
questions or observations he considered to be interesting to the entire class. The entire class 
participated in these sessions with few exceptions. Davidson used specific reminders about 
appropriate behaviors and occasionally moved or separated students to maintain order. 

Student Knowledge . Each element of Davidson’s science teaching appeared to stand on its 
own and to be largely derived from the ISC project. The rubric for assessing student 
understanding of snails was derived from reading of the entire set of 10 interviews. Transcripts 
were coded for the following components in the snail topic derived from discussions with 
Davidson, classroom observations, and class handouts: Reproduction, Eating, 
Digestion/Defecation, Movement, Sensing, Shell, and Structure/Function. The rubric was: 

1. High - Expressed correct information about snails as judged against the class handouts. 
They offered observational support where appropriate that was not clouded by preconceived 
notions. 

2. Medium - Expressed some correct information but also included misconceptions based 
on preconceived ideas or from incorrect interpretations of observations. Specific prompting was 
needed to generate ideas in some component topics. 

3. Low - Student could not clearly respond to prompting questions. These students tended 
to be those that had little to say. 

Students ranked high in their understanding of snails were able to respond with elaborated 
answers with very little prompting. This group included 4 of the 10 interviews. This student gave 
specific information that was supported by observations. 

I: I see. Tell me about these things sticking out in the front.

DIMM: These are tentacles. I think there's eyes on them. We're actually not even sure 
that they see or have eyes. Then we think these smaller ones on the bottom are feelers that 
feel things if something goes wrong. That's why it comes in when it touches things. 

The “high” students generally verbalized more than those ranked lower. Those with more 
to say also had more substance to say. In this example, talks about the shell and about 
reproduction. This girl expresses a misconception that was mentioned by seven of the 10 students 
interviewed in Davidson’s class. With students ranking lower, this misconception figured more 
prominently in the discourse. The misconception was that baby snails would crawl into the 
“female” snail to keep warm and moist and then crawl out. This appeared to be an integration of 
the correct idea that the shell served to keep the snail moist and that snails lay eggs out a small 
opening near the head. However, students pointed to the large and visible respiratory pore as the 
place where young took refuge. This misconception will be noted in future examples as well as 
this one. 

I: What's the shell for? 

D2FM: Protection. There's a hole there. It could be for a number of reasons, but I know 
it's inside of that one cuz mine-I don't want to get into that. I think it might breathe out of 
it. Sometimes the babies will go in to keep warm. The shell also helps it to keep moist so 
it's not all dried up. 

I: So the snails have babies, what's that look like? 

D2FM: They're eggs. 

I: What happens when they have the eggs? 

D2FM: They're both male, and they're both female, they have both organs, but they need 
somebody else to mate. When they mate they have tubes that go into each other and that's 
how they mate. When they lay the eggs I don't know where the eggs come out of and so 
what happens- it took ours about a week until they hatched and then they have small shells 
and they're really tiny and they (...) shells from the ocean and they eat it and it helps their 
shells get stronger. It's harder for them to keep warm, so that's why they go into the shell.

This response was elaborate and essentially correct with the exception of the misconception 
as noted. It appears that most of the unobservable information that students picked up came from a 
set of handouts. 

The one student ranked as “low” was full of misinformation and had to be prompted for it. 
The first part of the response states the misconception about baby snails but with a twist that makes 
the snail more like a marsupial. Additional example of misinformation follow. 

D3ML: Well I learned that instead of snails pooping out of where they usually poop, they 
poop out of their side ya know. They go to the bathroom at the side. Me and my friends 
think there's a hold in the snail right here where the babies go in there and when they're old 
enough to come out and they're hungry they come out and eat and the mom goes over to it 
and it kind of runs the snail over cuz it happened when we were doing this, and the baby 
was bom. 

I: (Because of the above comment about the “mom” snail) How Can you tell the mom 
snails from the dad snails? 

D3ML: The mom snails have a lighter shell, so this one seems like a girl probably cuz it 
has like a light shell. 

I: Tell me something about the parts of the snail. What's the shell for? 

D3ML: It's for what they sleep in. I don't know that much about it. They sleep in the 
shell, the shell is actually for the baby to stay in. 

Mr. Lesh. Grade 6 

View of Constructivist Teaching . Lesh expressed a tension between opening the class to 
questioning and exploration and guiding students in their work. Lesh is energetic and interacts 
with a large number of students during each class. There is often a sense of urgency in his 
questioning as though there is a specific point to be made that is just around the comer. The 
following excerpt describes the source of the urgency in terms of efficiency. The reference to the 
invention of writing concerns a unit on archeology. 




313 



334 



I think that-it's hard to do but I'm working on it, is valuing all points of view, especially 
the ones you know are misconceptions or inaccurate and acknowledging that that's good 
and I'm glad you’re thinking and trying to credit (the student with) that thinking and at the 
same time you want to say, but hey writing wasn't invented for another three million years. 
. . .1 like to put kids in a problem solving kind of situation and then ask them, how do you 
want to collect the data, how do you want to display it?. . . The teacher in me wants to plan 
and structure and organize because it's more efficient and it's more predictable. I would 
like to do more of allowing kids to plan their own things. 

Lesh is reflective and can see his instruction from various perspectives. He related his 
broad goals for developing inquiry and expression of student ideas to the variations he perceives in 
the dynamics of each class. Constructivist practices are mediated by what engages students 
quickly and effectively. If giving explicit instructions sets a task on a productive course, then he is 
in favor of doing that. He easily reflects on what is gained when a task is less structured and what 
is lost when explicitness replaces exploration. It is clear that he is happy to reduce the amount of 
rummaging and foraging that accompanies less structured work. 

Teaching Objectives . Lesh taught students about the nature of science through the use of 
“pet” rocks as a prop for analyzing, classifying, and as a means of raising questions. Students 
were to see science as a way to express tentative ideas about how the world works based on 
replicable information collected directly from experience. Scientists create these ideas by engaging 
in a variety of investigative processes (e.g. observing, classifying, predicting, data collection, 
communicating, measurement, experimenting, hypothesizing, applying math skills). Science is a 
body of knowledge created by people as a result of these investigations, but it is knowledge that 
changes as more investigations are conducted. Some knowledge is found to be incorrect, some is 
altered and some knowledge is considered new. 

Teaching Practice . Lesh is a high energy teacher who interacts with many students each 
class period. His practice can be characterized by the effective use of management routines that 
serve to remind students of specific procedures and behaviors. When taking notes on a video, 





314 



students were quickly reminded about clearing their desks and having the appropriate materials 
available. All students were ready within a few seconds. During a discussion on the importance 
of questions in scientific investigations, Lesh moved throughout the room as he fielded comments. 
He responded to each comment making wait-time II usually less than one second. Activities are 
conducted with similar energy and interaction. Students were asked to examine groups of “pet” 
rocks for patterns that could be used to classify them. Lesh visited all parts of the room providing 
verbal feedback and carrying a familiar clip board making notes on the conduct of specific groups 
for feedback later. 

Student Knowledge . The protocol for Mr. Lesh’s students was organized around four 
areas: (a) Practice and processes of science, (b) Fallibility of scientists, (c) Validation and proof in 
the practice of science, and (d) Respect for science and scientists. The rubric closely parallels the 
content rubric by distinguishing medium from high students based on the need for prompting and 
the eventual coherence or relatedness of the response. Low students usually lacked sufficient 
response to place them in the medium category. 

1. High - Using only the initial question as a prompt, the student was able discuss 
processes of science (e.g. observing, inferring, data collection, analyzing, etc.), fallibility of 
scientific knowledge based on at least a variable interpretation of data, production of new ideas at 
least based on specific activities of a scientist designed to generate new ideas (e.g. making new 
observations, studying, talking with other scientists) as opposed to vague references to “thinking” 
or “guessing.” 

2. Medium - Student was able to produce acceptable responses to the categories in the 
“high” ranking after specific verbal prompting. 

3. Low - Student was generally unable to produce responses to scientific activity that was 
distinguishable from the direct influence of verbal prompts. 

Student responses were either stimulated by recalling the classroom activity of caring for 
and describing a “pet rock” or by pictures of science-related activities. When asked What do 
scientists do? the following were typical responses: 




315 



’338 



L1FM: Science is kind of like how things are, how things work. That's basically what we 
kind of talked about with these rocks; how they are formed, what they are. So we kind of 
talked about the main science things about these rocks. 

L2MH: Well, science is just sort of the learning of different things and we were learning 
about different things like the-what kind of rocks there are and how to tell what they are. 
While most students related science to finding things out, some described the 
experimenting and investigative processes more explicitly. Describing the work of scientists 
outside of classroom examples was always vague and suggested that students had difficulty 
imagining or at least expressing the work of scientists. The following responses related classroom 
activities with rocks to the actual practice of science. 

L2MH: They do different experiments that would prove that they were like metamorphic or 
igneous or whatever. Like dropping acid on them and if they bubbled, they would 
probably be igneous. 

Students were consistent in saying that scientists were fallible and their work could turn out 
to be wrong. They also found this aspect of science to be reasonable, that is, it was OK for 
scientists to be wrong and still be good scientists. 

I: What do you suppose would happen if (another scientist studied) the rocks (and) came 
to different conclusions about what they thought was true, what would happen? 

L3FM: They’d probably go back and do it again. If they came to different things and they 
disagreed, they'd probably go back and do it again. 

I: Is it possible that they might continue to disagree about it? 

L3FM: Mmhmm(yes). 

I: What do you suppose might be necessary to resolve the problem? 

L3FM: To work together and then they can do both the things on it together so they can 
see if they were doing something wrong you could see what they were doing. 




316 



337 



The general position on how scientists respond to being wrong or finding some 
information to be incorrect, was to describe scientists studying something in more detail and gather 
more information. 

L4MH: They guess and check and then they go around to like other scientists and see what 
they got and see what's like similar. They like go around to other people. 

I: . . .Is it possible that with all that activity they may never know? 

L4MH: Ya. 

I: In other words just wouldn't ever be conclusive about how old the rock is or what it was 
made of exactly? 

L4MH: They could be close but I don't now if they could be super exact, but maybe 
sometimes they could. 

I: What would make it possible or is it possible to be super exact? 

L4MH: Ya, cause with the technology we have today like microscopes and like identifying 
the minerals and what kind of rock it is and comparing it to other rocks it could be super 
exact. 

I: If you had a scientist or a team of scientists that did. . . a lot of checking and a lot of 
testing and so on,... and say ten years later another scientist or a group of scientists did 
similar studies. . . and they said that the first group was wrong even though the first group 
felt that they were being super exact. Would that be possible to happen, and if so, why? 
L4MH: Ya, because technology could improve, like a long time ago they thought the earth 
was flat and they thought they were super right and it turned out they were super wrong. 
These students believed that scientists improve in their ability to gather more and better 
information through improved technology, the involvement of more scientists, and studying 
something over long periods of time. They did not express an understanding that science can 
advance based on new ideas or theories that make new investigations possible.

Discussion 



The data presented is primarily anecdotal. The teacher interview data is reliable to the 
extent that the two different interviewers who asked similar questions about views of teaching and 
instructional objectives generated similar results. That was generally true. The validity of one set 
of teacher interviews rests on how well the protocol represents the categories of the CLES and in 
turn how well the CLES represents what is generally held to be a constructivist learning 
environment. Statements of validity in this area are problematic. First there was no expert 
assessment concerning validity of the protocol with respect to the CLES. The guide for designing 
the interview is shown in Figure 1. Second, given the data in this study, there is some difficulty in 
establishing what constitutes a constructivist learning environment. There is a degree of internal 
validity in the student interview data in that the authors reached agreement with each teacher on the 
appropriateness of questions that probed what was being taught. There was also discussion 
among the authors and ISC project directors concerning the validity between what the teachers 
were teaching and what was presented in summer workshops. 



Insert Figure 1 about here 



Even with the above caveats, together these four profiles of teaching beliefs and behaviors 
provide descriptions that prove serviceable in making testable statements about constructivist- 
based, inquiry-oriented teaching. The data present a wide variety of teaching practices while at the 
same time presenting a remarkably similar picture of teacher beliefs. These teachers affirmed the 
value of student expression and student thinking contributing to the conduct of instruction. 

Jenks: ...what I think what I wish would happen doesn't always happen.... see what 

kinds of things they know. 

George: . . .but I guess it's some way to get the information out and then I do a lot of 

mind mapping. 



Davidson: . . .to let the kids kind of lead in their questioning and then going and creating a 
curriculum about what their questions were. 

Lesh: .. .valuing all points of view, especially the ones you know are misconceptions 

or inaccurate and acknowledging that that's good and I'm glad you're thinking 
and trying to credit (the student with) that thinking. 

The overall sense of “constructivism” that comes from these teachers trades more on the 
metaphor of “building lives” than “constructing knowledge.” This softer view of constructivism 
translates easily into statements about the significance of student ideas in learning. However, it is 
difficult to observe the role these ideas have during instruction beyond the teacher providing an 
opportunity for students to express them. Davidson seemed the most purposeful in probing 
students for ideas then looking for ways build the curriculum from them. But his approach lacked 
closure in two ways. It lacked the closure of summarizing content and reinforcing important 
scientific ideas. He spoke of this problem erroneously as being an intended part of constructivist 
teaching. His teaching also lacked closure around the specific meaning and value of student ideas 
in his curriculum. Their ideas never received the criticism that ideas, taken seriously, deserve. 
Consequently we are left wondering how Davidson and the other teachers perceived the role of all 
this student talk. Should student statements be recorded, assessed, and criticized? Should 
students be expected to generate and express ideas or may they opt out and merely participate in 
discussion at a non-specific level? 

Even though the teachers seemed to have a common understanding of what we have called 
a “soft” version of constructivism, they had widely differing views of what it meant to practice 
constructivist teaching. Both George and Lesh developed instructional routines prior to ISC 
workshops that were employed to bring out student thinking, structure group interaction for 
sharing ideas, and promote connections to learning outside the classroom. This contrasted with the 
more open teaching styles of Jenks and Davidson. Their goal was to generate a free flow of ideas 
that allowed for all kinds of observations in Davidson’s room and the generation of analogy and 
metaphor in Jenks’ room. This contrast raises a question about the meaning of process in a 



O

319 



constructivist classroom. It was hard to find the content of subject matter in Davidson’s room. It 
was in a sense all process. Some might say that Davidson opted for a form of non-teaching in 
science by letting his students raise questions and record information without comment. 
Assessment was based on the completion of notes and drawings. Jenks on the other hand 
expected her students to be able to note and draw specific differences in the form and function of 
bird beaks, wings, and feet. Is constructivist practice open to both forms of teaching? If both are 
valid forms of constructivist teaching then how are they related during instruction? How are 
teachers to address both explicit knowledge goals emphasized by both George and Lesh and still 
promote inquiry and the construction of knowledge? 

Student knowledge was assessed after the fact with no “pre-test” comparison. It is entirely 
possible that whatever Davidson’s students said about snails or Jenks’ and George’s students said 
about birds was understood before instruction began. However, there was a consistency across 
student knowledge in each class that clearly pointed to common experiences and some common 
understandings that would not have arrived intact across all students. Experience, about which 
students talked clearly, took the form of whole class discussions, group interactions, and hands-on 
activities. From the teacher-selected sample of each class (see Table 2), students demonstrated 
knowledge that was consistent with what the teachers said they were trying to teach. This was 
demonstrated by Davidson’s students in their highly descriptive discussion of how they observed 
and experimented with their snails. They also shared a remarkable misconception about 
reproduction and care of offspring that was promulgated around the room. This is consistent with 
Davidson’s position of not providing information, an admittedly perverse interpretation of science 
teaching. Students of Jenks and George were not only able to recall specific activities concerning, 
for example, the classification of birds (George) or the generation of analogies (Jenks) but also 
apply knowledge of form and function to pictures of birds they had not seen before. 

Teachers selected students who represented a cross section of achievement in their 
classrooms. The students represented that cross section but not always as the teachers expected. 
Of 23 interviews, there were 14 discrepancies between teacher ranking of student achievement and 




320 



rankings based on assessment of student interviews. In two cases, rankings based on interviews 
placed a student ranked “high” by the teacher in the low knowledge category and in one case a 
student ranked “low” by the teacher was placed in the high knowledge category. But whether our 
ranking would hold up under replication or not, the overall picture was that students from each 
class demonstrated knowledge consistent with teaching objectives presented in a teacher-defined, 
constructivist learning environment. 

Implications for Teaching and Further Research 

Given the variety of teaching practices exhibited by these four teachers, there are no easily 
synthesized implications for teaching. Interview data concerning instructional objectives and 
teacher beliefs, observations of teaching practice, and assessment of student knowledge reinforces 
the impact of specific instructional objectives that are in concert with teacher beliefs. The disparity 
between Davidson’s objectives and those of the other teachers highlights two related questions for 
further research. What are ways of stating instructional objectives that are best met by 
constructivist teaching practices? And this question begs the second: What are specific 
operationalized forms of constructivist practice? Research in this direction will require what 
Reigeluth (1983) called prescriptive instructional design theory. Such a theory deduces 
instructional methods from a given set of instructional goals and conditions. Constructivist theory 
has typically been used to explain student learning in clinical settings or in specially arranged 
classroom instruction. As such, discussion of learning theory and instructional design theory has 
been commingled in research reports. Data from this study suggests that constructivist theory as 
applied to instruction needs to spawn an instructional theory explicit enough to deduce specific 
methods that in turn can be tested in classrooms. 

Elsewhere one of the authors has argued for a theory of “dynamic adaptation of instruction” 
that recognizes learner capabilities vary within and among individuals and that the goals of 
instruction change even within the context of a unit or lesson (Flick, 1996). Teachers in this study 
were experienced and demonstrated capabilities in adapting instruction to a variety of students. 
What we may have observed in these widely varying teaching practices was a common set of ideas 




321 



about constructivist theory being adapted dynamically in response to a number of classroom 
variables. Some of these variables are well known and well studied such as developmental 
capabilities and prior achievement of students. Others may be more subtle and less understood 
such as the character and social dynamics of an entire class or the pace and nature of instruction 
adjusted for both local and global conditions. 

A short list of implications for research on teaching and teacher education might include: 

1 . Analyze instruction by skilled teachers for how objectives for both explicit knowledge 
and inquiry or higher-order thinking are met. 

2. Operationalize constructivist-based, inquiry-oriented objectives, for example in terms of 
observations of student activity or student discourse. 

3. Expand understanding of assessment so that it can accommodate the nature and purposes 
of constructivist-based, inquiry-oriented instruction. 

4. Explicitly address the relationships that exist between selecting activities and identifying 
learning objectives. An objective can be met by a variety of activities and an activity can meet a 
variety of learning objectives.

Abstract 

The Maryland Collaborative for Teacher Preparation (MCTP) is a National Science 
Foundation (NSF) funded statewide undergraduate program for students who plan to become 
specialist mathematics and science upper elementary or middle level teachers. Higher education 
institutions involved in this project include the majority of higher education institutions within the 
Maryland System responsible for teacher preparation, including community college representation. 
In addition, several large public school districts are active partners. The primary goal of the MCTP 
is to promote the development of professional teachers who are confident teaching mathematics and 
science using technology, who can make connections between and among the disciplines, and who 
can provide an exciting and challenging learning environment for students of diverse backgrounds. 

This paper presents a reflection on the research conducted in a longitudinal, multi-level, 
multi-dimensional research program charged with documenting and interpreting the development 
and implementation of a NSF funded, statewide teacher preparation program in mathematics and 
science education. The intent of the reflection is to contribute toward the researchers’ sense 
making as the research program enters its fourth year of operation. It is also offered as a case 
study of research from which interested readers may gain insights to assist in their research efforts 
in diverse contexts. Reflections relate to the decisions and actions made in the following areas: the 




326 



349 



research team; the research design; the research instruments; the data collection; and the data 
analysis. A call for internal support of research efforts within NSF and other funded mathematics 
and science teacher preparation projects is made to support knowledge growth in this critical realm. 

Background 

The Maryland Collaborative for Teacher Preparation (MCIP) is a National Science 
Foundation (NSF) funded statewide undergraduate program for students who plan to become 
specialist mathematics and science upper elementary or middle level teachers. Teacher candidates 
selected to participate in the MCTP program are, in general, representative of all teacher candidates 
in elementary teacher preparation programs in academic ability. MCTP teacher candidates are 
distinctive, however, by expressing and interest in teaching mathematics and science. Recruitment 
efforts have attracted many students traditionally underserved in the teaching force, most notably 
African Americans to the MCTP. 

Higher education institutions involved in this project include the majority of higher 
education institutions within the Maryland System responsible for teacher preparation. Several 
community colleges also participate. In addition, large public school districts are active partners. 
The goal of the MCTP is to promote the development of professional teachers who are competent 
to teach mathematics and science using technology, who can make connections between and 
among the disciplines, and who can provide an exciting and challenging learning environment for 
students of diverse backgrounds. This goal is in accord with the educational practice reforms 
advocated by the major professional mathematics and science education communities (see, for 
example, National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM), 1991; American Association for 
the Advancement of Science (AAAS), 1993; National Research Council (NRC) of the National 
Academy of Sciences, 1996). 

The MCTP was funded in 1993 for up to a five year period to create teacher education 
programs that contain: 

• Specially designed courses in science and mathematics, taught by instructors 
committed to a hands-on, minds-on interdisciplinary approach. 




3.50 



327 



• Internship experiences with research opportunities in business, industrial and 
scientific settings, and with teaching activities in science centers, zoos, and other 
institutions. 

• Field experiences and student teaching situations with mentors devoted to the 
interdisciplinary approach to mathematics and science. 

• Modem technologies as standard tools for planning and assessment, classroom and 
laboratory work, problem-solving and research 

• Placement assistance and sustained support during the induction year in the 
teaching profession 

• Financial support for qualified students. 

Enactment of the Program 

In practice, the MCTP undergraduate classes are typically taught by senior faculty in 
mathematics, science, and education who make efforts to focus on developing understanding of a 
few central concepts and to make connections between the sciences and between mathematics and 
science. In some instances doctoral students who have interned with a faculty member in an MCTP 
class and have expressed a ken desire to teach in a reform-based manner also teach MCTP classes. 
Faculty strive to infuse technology into their teaching practice, and to employ a instructional 
strategies recommended by the literature to be compatible with the constructivist perspective (e.g., 
student-centered, address conceptual change, promote reflection on changes in thinking, and stress 
logic and fundamental principles as opposed to memorization of unrelated facts) (see, for example, 
Cobb, Wood, Yackel, McNeal, 1992; Driver, 1987). Faculty lecture is diminished and student- 
based problem-solving is emphasized which requires cross-disciplinary mathematical and scientific 
applications. 

The MCTP teacher candidates, selected by using criteria developed at each institution, take 
the reformed undergraduate mathematics, science, and education classes and have the opportunity 
to participate in summer internships in mathematics and science rich environments (e.g., museums, 
zoological parks, and private companies).

Overview of the Paper 

This paper presents a reflection on the research conducted in a longitudinal, multi-level, 
multi-dimensional research program charged with documenting and interpreting the development 
and implementation of a NSF funded, statewide teacher preparation program in mathematics and 
science education. The intent of the reflection is to contribute toward the researchers’ sense 
making as the research program enters its fourth year of operation and to offer insights which 
interested readers may use in their contexts. Key areas examined include: 

• The research team 

• The research design 

• The research instruments 

• The data collection 

• Data analysis 

A call for internal support of research in funded NSF teacher preparation projects concludes 
the paper. Interested readers are invited to journey to the MCTP’s homepage on the internet 
(http://www.wam.umd.edu/~toh/MCTP.html) to obtain additional text on the MCTP Research 
Group’s efforts (including copies of previous research reports that expand on points alluded to in 
this paper). 

The Research Team 

The MCTP project leadership, under the direction of Jim Fey, MCTP Project Director, 
University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP) appointed J. Randy McGinnis (science educator), 
UMCP, and Tad Watanabe (mathematics educator), Towson State University , to share the 
leadership of a Research Component of the MCTP. The guiding notion for this decision was to 
ensure representation of both the mathematics education and the science education research 
domains in the project’s research program (see, McGinnis, Roth-McDuffie, Graeber, & Watanabe, 
1995). This notion was extended in the selection and recruitment of the two expert research 
consultants to the group (Catherine Brown, mathematics education, Indiana University, and 




329 



352 



Kenneth G. Tobin, science education, Florida State University). Anna Graeber, mathematics 
educator, UMCP, agreed to serve as a mentor to the Research Group. 

Reflection : Balancing the research team between the mathematics and science education 
research domains has produced a powerful research team with a vision of teacher preparation 
research arising from the confluence of different research lineages bearing on the same issue, 
teacher preparation. A significant effect of this complementary research team is the expanded body 
of literature (and contact individuals within each domain) from which to seek guidance and 
understanding. Another significant effect is the broadened number of research forums to present 
and to report the group’s research products (including at the annual meetings of the following 
research associations and in their respective journals: Association of Educators of Teachers of 
Science, National Association for Research in Science Teaching, National Science Teachers 
Association, National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, Psychology in Mathematics Education, 
Research Council on Diagnostic and Prescriptive Mathematics, and American Educational Research 
Association). 

A somewhat disquieting realization which has also come as a result of this collaboration in 
mathematics and science education research has been how difficult it is under even the best of 
conditions to broaden one’s identity soley as a “science education researcher” or a “mathematics 
education researcher” to create a new research identity that includes another discipline. We define 
ourselves in specialized educational research communities in which we were enculterated and we 
can readily envision; we resist replacing those images of ourselves with more expansive identities 
that we create through the process of research collaboration with the ‘other.’ Currently there is no 
formally established research community of mathematics and science educators to support this 
identity change. Even if there were, would we be able to participate in it along with our previous 
research community responsibilites? These are unresolved issues we ponder in times of reflection. 
On a positive note, the experience of collaborative research offers the unique benefit of challenging 
us to reflect on what are the similarities and differences between our research communities. This 
leds us to better understand ourselves, each other, and educational research in general.

The Research Desien 

In essence, the primary purpose of research in the MCTP is directed at knowledge growth 
in undergraduate mathematics and science teacher education. The unique elements of the MCT P 
(particularly the instruction of mathematical and scientific concepts and reasoning methods in 
undergraduate content and methods courses that model the practice of active, interdisciplinary 
teaching) are being documented and interpreted from two foci: the perspectives of the faculty and 
the teacher candidate. The research design is longitudinal, extending throughout the entire four- 
year undergraduate teacher education preparation program and the first induction year of the MCTP 
specialist teachers. Also, since the scope of the MCTP program is statewide, the design of the 
research is multi-level (state, higher education institution, and individual). And finally, since the 
researchers composing the MCTP Research Group are diverse in research discipline backgrounds 
(mathematics education and science education) it is multi-dimensional (both faculty and teacher 
candidates serve as layers of interpretation, and both research domains (mathematics and science 
education are investigated) are documented and interpreted. Implementation of all components of 
the research design are contingent upon the research questions crafted for the program. 

The following questions served as the a priori research questions that were presented to the 
National Science Foundation in the MCTP grant proposal: 

1. What is the nature of the faculty and teacher candidates' beliefs and attitudes concerning 
the nature of mathematics and science, the interdisciplinary teaching and learning of 
mathematics and science to diverse groups (both on the higher education and upper 
elementary and middle level), and the use of technology in teaching and learning 
mathematics and science? 

2. Do the faculty and teacher candidates perceive the instruction in the MCTP as responsive 
to prior knowledge, addressing conceptual change, establishing connections among 
disciplines, incorporating technology, promoting reflection on changes in thinking, 
stressing logic and fundamental principles as opposed to memorization of unconnected 



ERIC 



331 



facts, and modeling the kind of teaching/leaming they would like to see on the upper 
elementary, middle level? 

Upon NSF funding, some additional first-year research questions emerged: 

(1) Does the integration of mathematics and science content and pedagogical preparation in 
their college teacher preparation program lead to curricular integration of those subjects in 
teaching opportunities by the specialist teacher candidates? 

(2) Does the strengthened content and pedagogical preparation of the specialist teacher 
candidates help them to focus instruction on student conceptual growth, rather than factual 
and procedural learning? Also, does it prepare them to make deeper assessments of the 
learner's thinking and to choose instructional responses from an array of options? 

(3) Do the science and informal education experiences assist the specialist teacher 
candidates in engaging learners in authentic learning investigations? Do they provide them 
with pedagogical knowledge and resources for meaningful motivation of students? 
Reflection : These research questions have served the MCTP Research Group as 

identifiable landmarks in a sea of collected data as the research program has progressed over the 
last three and a half years. While valuing and employing a liberating and creative “emergent and 
contingent” research modus operandi (K.G. Tobin, personal communication, November 10, 
1995), the early conceptualization of a limited number of research questions within the MCTP 
Research Group has been useful. The initial research conceptualization has assisted us in focusing 
on clear targets upon which to direct our energies and upon which our efforts can be evaluated. 
This has not restricted our interest in equally worthwhile emergent research inquires such as 
investigating the process of faculty transformation. It has, however, established a core referent 
upon which we all feel responsible to contribute. 

The Research Instruments 

Crafting instruments to assist in collecting relevant data that promise to inform the key 
research questions was the first step. It required extensive energy from the MCTP Research 
Group. Developing a valid and reliable questionnaire to measure teacher candidates’ attitudes and 




332 355 



beliefs toward mathematics and science and about the teaching of those disciplines became 
necessary once an exhaustive review of the literature did not identify any one extant instrument 
which had that focus or could efficiently do so within a 15-minute time constraint (a constraint 
insisted upon by the project leadership). The final 48-item instrument took two years to develop in 
order to ensure its validity and reliability as a research tool. It is named Attitudes and Beliefs about 
the Nature of and the Teaching of Mathematics and Science and is especially appropriate for use 
with prospective teachers of mathematics and science (see, e.g., McGinnis, Shama, Graeber, & 
Watanabe, 1997a; 1997b). 

Multiple interview protocols for teacher candidates and college faculty (content specialists 
and method specialists) also needed to be developed, peer reviewed, and field tested over the years 
of the research program’s operation. An additional instrument to use for classroom observations 
was also developed and field tested before implementation. Still needed is a valid and reliable 
content and process assessment in mathematics and science to administer at periodic points to the 
MCTP teacher candidates. 

Reflection : This component of the MCTP Research Group’s efforts has taken everyone in 
the research group by surprise. The time and energy required to develop valid and reliable 
research instruments is enormous and an oftentimes taxing exercise in patience, both among the 
researchers, the participants, and the project leadership. The alternative, however, of using 
research instruments justifiably open to peer criticism as not being valid or reliable or not 
appropriate to inform the research questions is not viable within a professionally run educational 
research program. Hard decisions within the research group on what needs to be done, in which 
order, and by whom are necessary to make and can generate tensions among the collaboration of 
researchers. There is also the danger of losing sight of the point of the research program— to 
answer the research questions— and to myopically focus exclusively on the development of the 
research instruments as if that were the main point of the research program. The MCTP Research 
Group has progressed through these issues by carving the research into areas of mutual 
responsibility (instrument development and data collection) and areas of individual research 




333 



interests (i.e., faculty discourse analysis, faculty modeling, faculty and teacher candidate case 
studies) with some sense of equity guiding individual time and energy expenditure. Periodic 
reviews of the research program by the NSF and the project leadership have also served to reorient 
the direction of the research group so that answering the landmark research questions remain the 
central focus of the research. We have learned the value of using previously developed data 
collection instruments and are currently searching the literature for some valid and reliable 
instruments to measure the mathematics and science content the teacher candidates hold when they 
begin their senior- level methods classes. The “Group Test of Logical Thinking” (GALT) will 
satisfy the need to assess science process skills (Roadrangka, Yeany, & Padilla, 1982). Readers 
aware of any appropriate instruments to assess mathematics and science content and mathematics 
process skills are requested to contact the first author of this paper. 

The Data Collection 

Since this was a statewide research effort, with eight institutions of higher learning 
participating in the project, obtaining permission to collect data and then enacting implementing 
strategies to collect the data also required ongoing attention and much energy. Procedures for 
administration of the questionnaire, the interview protocols, and collection of data artifacts also 
needed to be developed and approved for use by multiple committees charged with ensuring the 
safety of human subjects throughout the University of Maryland Higher Education System. 

Reflection : Obtaining ongoing instructor cooperation to administer the project’s 
questionnaire in MCIP classes at the beginning and at the end of each semester was essential. 
Sending the materials out to them from the MCTP office with an accompanying letter that 
emphasized the commitment the project made to engage in continuous research efforts facilitated 
this data collection. Interviewers to conduct teacher candidate interviews twice a semester were 
recruited from the pool of practicing teachers participating in the project. The NSF project’s 
funding was essential to remunerate them for their participation and to pay for the voluminous 
taped data to be transcribed. 




334 357 



Data Analysis 



Since this study employed complementary research methods (Jaeger, 1988), quantitative, 
qualitative, discourse analysis, and action research, data analysis in each domain was required. 
Each is summarized below. 

Quantitative 

A fundamental assumption of the MCIP is that changes in pre-secondary level 
mathematics and science educational practices require reform within the undergraduate mathematics 
and science subject matter and education classes teacher candidates take throughout their teacher 
preparation programs. A second assumption is that MCTP teacher candidates who take reformed 
undergraduate mathematics, science, and method classes that are informed by the constructivist 
epistemology (i.e., learners actively construct knowledge through interaction with their 
surroundings and experiences, and learners interpret these experiences based on prior knowledge) 
(see, for example, von Glasersfeld, 1987, 1990) develop more positive attitudes and beliefs 
toward mathematics and science and the teaching of those subjects. A third assumption is that 
throughout the MCTP teacher preparation programs the active collaboration among college faculty, 
public school personnel, and colleagues in work environments rich in mathematics and science will 
prepare the teacher candidates to successfully teach diverse students. 

To test these assumptions, the documentation of the MCTP teacher candidates’ attitudes 
and beliefs toward and about the learning of and the teaching of mathematics and science 
throughout their undergraduate years was recognized as essential to perform. In addition, since a 
major component of the MCTP includes a commitment to infuse technology in the teaching and 
learning of mathematics and science, the documentation of how this is enacted on the college-level 
and how this influenced the teacher candidates’ attitudes and beliefs also became crucial to report 
The documentation system designed includes on-going teacher candidate interviews, classroom 
observations, and a regularly administered instrument in all MCTP classes to all students. 

Therefore, the following research questions using quantitative methodologies are being 
investigated: 




1. Is there a difference between the MCTP teacher candidates’ and the non-MCTP teacher 

candidates’ attitude toward: 

(i) mathematics and science? 

(ii) the interdisciplinary teaching and learning of mathematics and science? 

(iii) the use of technology in teaching and learning mathematics and science? 

2. Is there a difference between the MCTP teacher candidates’ and the non-MCTP teacher 

candidates’ beliefs toward: 

(i) the nature of mathematics and science? 

(ii) the interdisciplinary teaching and learning of mathematics and science? 

(iii) the use of technology in teaching and learning mathematics and science? 

Answers to these questions are particularly relevant to two domains of widespread interest 
in mathematics and science teacher preparation. The first domain is in documenting what attitudes 
and beliefs elementary/middle level teacher candidates develop during their undergraduate college 
programs toward the nature of and the learning/ teaching of subject matter. This information will 
enable those interested in mathematics and science teacher preparation to construct more valid 
attitudinal and belief profiles of a typical major. With that information teacher educators will be 
better able to understand teacher candidates at discrete levels of their program. The second domain 
is in better understanding the effect of systemic effort throughout the entire undergraduate subject 
matter and pedagogy teacher preparation program to institute reforms advocated by current thinking 
in the mathematics and science professional communities. This information will enable those 
interested in mathematics and science teacher preparation to more accurately predict the 
consequences of enacting advocated reform practices. 

Items for the instrument needed to measure constructs within the affective, belief, and 
epistemological areas to inform the research questions include: attitudes toward and beliefs about 
mathematics and science, interdisciplinary teaching and learning of mathematics and science, and 
the use of technology to teach and leam mathematics and science. Sections of the instrument that 




336 



359 



were verified by Factor Analysis dealt with beliefs about mathematics and science; attitudes toward 
mathematics and science; beliefs about teaching mathematics and science; attitudes toward learning 
to teach mathematics and science; and attitudes toward teaching mathematics and science. 

The instrument includes two groups of items. One group consists of thirty-two items that 
are to be answered by all students. The other group consists of nine items that are to be answered 
only by those intending to teach. The pre-planned sub-scales were verified on each group of items 
separately, using principle-components factor-analysis, with varimax rotation. The reliability of 
each of the five sub-groups in the instrument was examined by Cronbach's alpha (n =486, 

a=.76). For each of the five groups, a variable X ; was defined as the mean of scores on items in 

the group. 

Another factor that was further extracted from each of the five groups is linked to the 
classification of most items into pairs. Each pair included two corresponding items, one from the 
mathematics discipline, and the other from the science discipline. Paired items were then also 
examined for reliability. 

Reflection 

The use of this research methodology, while initially viewed as a necessary yet unexciting 
area of research by members of the research team, is proving to be essential in the effort to paint a 
landscape picture of the attitudes and beliefs of college students in Maryland (both of teacher 
candidates and other majors) toward the disciplines of mathematics and science and the teaching of 
those disciplines. In addition, the instrument development was exhaustive and rigorous and offers 
both the mathematics and the science education research communities a valid and reliable 
instrument available for use in differing contexts. However, we have learned that the crafting of a 
survey instrument to measure these constructs and then the analyzing of the results in a statistically 
valid manner requires much expertise that takes considerable time to develop. Our 
recommendation to other research groups is to recruit associate members to the core research team 
who have the specialized expertise in questionnaire development and quantitative data analysis 
early in the research program. This is a structured research strategy with highly developed rules 



ERIC 



337 




and procedures that requires expert attention to be successful and not excessively tax the energy of 
the research team. » 

Qualitative 

The interpretative research methods employed in this on-going five-year study are guided 
by Alasuutari (1995), Erickson (1986), and LeCompte, Millory, & Preissle (1992). The intent is 
to focus on "the meanings of actions, as defined by the actors' points of view " (Erickson, 1986, 
p.l 19). It is conducted within a constructivist paradigm which is guided by an associated set of 
ontological, epistemological, and methodological beliefs (Guba & Lincoln, 1989). Namely, as 
investigators, we assume that there are multiple realities which can be socially constructed, ours 
would be but one. And, we believe that our findings will be knowledge claims or constructions 
which we negotiate among ourselves by using the data we collected in the setting in which we 
worked. 

Data are currently being analyzed throughout the study by the principal investigators and 
doctoral education students. The analysis and interpretation process consists of reading and 
examining collected data placed in the NUD.IST environment and formulating tentative assertions 
that are being negotiated among the investigators. These tentative assertions are being tested by 
many sources in the data set. This iterative process of phases of interpretation, critique, and 
reanalysis is a hermeneutic cycle that results in the emergence of joint constructions of one possible 
view of the intending teachers' discussion and actions during their undergraduate classes. 

Preliminary analysis of the wealth of data from the first two years of this research study 
(there exists approximately a year’s delay in the analysis of data due to the time needed to collect 
and then process the data into formats amenable to analysis tools and strategies) indicates that there 
are intriguing regularities in the participants' attitudes, beliefs, and performances. These findings 
are reported in depth in other research reports (see, e.g., King & McDuffie, 1996; McGinnis, 
Graeber, Roth-McDuffie, Huntley, & King, 1996; Roth-McDuffie, McGinnis, & Watanabe, 

1996; Watanabe, McGinnis, & Huntley, 1996; Watanabe, McGinnis, & Roth-McDuffie, 1997). 

In addition, several manuscripts based on these findings are under review for journal publication in 




338 



the Journal of Research in Science Teaching, the Journal for Research in Mathematics Education, 
and School Science and Mathematics. 

Reflection: 

The use of this research methodology has been particularly effective in providing the 
researchers with participant voices from throughout the project. These voices are used to construct 
a coherent story of the project in general to share with those interested in this NSF teacher 
preparation project. The voices are also used in case studies of individual faculty members and 
college students participating in the project. Themes of how the faculty perceive each other’s role 
in teacher preparation, how they perceive making connections between mathematics and science, 
what constraints they see in implementing courses that emphasize connections between 
mathematics and science, and how individual faculty members and teacher candidates perceive the 
enactment of MCTP reforms are some of the analytical constructs that have emerged. 

These stories, while cogently telling the MCTP story, have also produced some tensions 
within the Research Group and within the project The selection of case study individuals is 
difficult. Should only the “success” stories be told or should also the less than ideal situations be 
documented and interpreted? Who gives permission to being revealed among peers as a teacher in 
need of assistance in a teacher preparation program, less than successful in implementing the 
project’s reforms? What researcher desires to have colleagues unhappy with their depiction in a 
case study? How can the researchers resist the prevailing hope of the project leadership that this 
project will be successful? Insisting upon the use of pseudonyms for faculty to protect the 
confidentiality of them and their students strikes some as unnecessary, even counter to their goal of 
being recognized by their peers, yet needs to be done. These are some of the salient issues which 
must be expected to arise in research projects of this scope. Maintaining a vision of conducting 
oneself as an ethically bound professional researcher oftentimes is the only guidance one has in 
these matters, as insufficient as that may sound, or feel, in particular situations.

Discourse 

Discourse as used in this study is defined as the dynamic interplay of dialogue between 
individuals that includes the use of rules developed by certain groups of people (Gee, 1990). The 
focus on discourse in this study is the result of recent theoretical views that stress the importance of 
the context in which members of a community communicate (Greeno, 1991; Rogoff, 1990; Roth & 
Tobin, 1996). Conversations, or 'talk,' is recognized as a particularly revealing resource in 
analyzing social interactions for patterns of sense-making in a community (Lemke, 1990; 
McCarthy, 1994). The assumption made is that this form of analysis particularly will assist in 
understanding the college teaching faculty’s beliefs and actions taken in designing and teaching 
undergraduate teacher preparatory science classes in which connections between mathematics and 
science is a major goal. Research in teacher beliefs and actions have been a major focus of teacher 
education research since Clark and Peterson (1986) and Munby (1986) alerted the research 
community to its importance in understanding teaching practice. 

In the MCTP, the large speech community consists of college faculty members who teach 
revised mathematics and science undergraduate content classes at universities, colleges, and 
community colleges in Maryland. Mathematics and science content expertise and an expressed 
interest in reforming content classes for MCTP teacher candidates define the criteria membership in 
the teaching faculty speech community. Sharing ideas on the role of mathematics and science in 
MCTP undergraduate content is a conversation referent. In each of these speech, or discourse 
communities there are two groups: discipline content experts (termed ‘mathematician or science 
content specialists’ by the conversants in this study’s speech community) and pedagogy content 
experts (termed ‘mathematics or science methods specialists’ by the conversants in this study’s 
speech community) (see, McGinnis & Watanabe, 1996). 

Reflection 

The use of this research methodology has assisted the researchers in conceptualizing the 
components of the community which defines the MCTP. It is used to visualize the discourse 
landscape college mathematics and science teachers inhabit when the referent in their thinking is 





340 



science and mathematics, two disciplines the MCTP project hopes to connect. A similar analysis is 
currently being conducted focusing on the college student participants. Researchers should be 
prepared for individual members from discourse communites to disagree with statements made by 
other members of the same discourse community. This can elict much heated discussion if a 
member check is performed in a group setting, since it reveals the diversity of thought within a 
group that defines itself as a community. Some members may even question the validity of the 
data since not all members of the discourse community may be present to acknowledge their 
statements. It is therefore recommended to other research groups to emphasize to the participants 
that the intent of the discourse anaylsis is to document commonalities and differences within a 
discourse community. The goal of the research is not to promote a single voice for the discourse 
community. However, the process of documenting the voices within a community and the sharing 
of those voices with the members may lead some within the discourse community to pursue this 
goal. 

Action Research 

Action research is also being conducted within this project. Research on practice by 
practitioners is termed action research (LeCompte, Millroy, & Preissle, 1992), classroom research 
(Stenhouse, 1975), practical enquiry (Richardson, 1994), or teacher-research (Fleischer, 1995). 

Its primary goal is to promote a self-reflective analysis that can improve teaching practice. Action 
research as used in this study is guided by the tenets advocated by Collins (1995) and Gore and 
Zeicher (1991). It proceeds in a cycle of four steps: planning, enacting, observing the plan, and 
reflection. 

Several MCTP professors of education are investigating their own teaching practices of 
MCTP candidates (see, e.g., Watanabe & Kinach, 1997). Since these studies involve an in-depth 
examination of a phenomena, they will be reported as case studies (Stake, 1995). The case study 
methodology enables the researchers to develop an in-depth story which provides a framework 
from which other teacher researchers can reflect on their experiences and which can inform future 
research (Romberg, 1992).

Reflection 

It is anticipated that this research methodology will add a strong emic flavor to the 
program. The primary focus of these studies is to document and interpret the methods professors’ 
innovation in practices guided by the goals of the MCTP. MCTP mathematics and science 
methods specialists with expertise in action research are ideally suited to conducted these studies of 
teaching practice innovation. However, these studies once again require the researchers to face 
difficult ethical questions. How can one who is intimately involved with the project avoid the bias 
of depicting their personal teaching experiences as a success? How can one whose identity in the 
project is based on expertise in teaching practice seem to be less than successful in implementing 
the project’s reforms? How comfortable is it to comment on the preparation of the project’s teacher 
candidates if they are not found to be positively impacted by the project influenced subject matter 
courses? Acknowledging these tensions by recruiting a co-researcher who is not a member of the 
project to assist with the action research study is one way we have found to guard against these 
biases. Finally, an important question that has emerged is some apparent conflict between the roles 
of the MCTP professor and the MCTP researcher. As a researcher, the professor wants to 
suspend judgment and mull over events occurring in the classroom; however, in many cases, as a 
professor he has to make an immediate judgment so that the classroom activities can continue. 

How does this conflict impact the ‘naturalness’ of the professor’s instruction? Other research 
groups should also anticipate these type of issues and consider actions they can take to maintain the 
integrity of their research effort. 

Conclusion 

This paper presents compelling evidence that the MCTP Research Group has been active in 
carrying out a needed research program in a NSF funded mathematics and science teacher 
education project It also presents some of the research team’s learning in practice. Currently there 
are a dearth of reports on the process of conducting research within these large-scale teacher 
education projects. While conducting research within the MCTP project, the researchers have 
oftentimes collaborated with individuals representing other NSF Collaboratives and funded teacher

enhancement projects. Surprisingly, the MCIP is distinguished among its peer projects in its 
organizational chart by including an internal Research Group and by budgeting ongoing financial 
support for its operation. This ongoing funding, no more than 4% of the project’s 6 million dollar 
funding, has enabled this project to develop a research program that is actively contributing to the 
knowledge base on teacher education in mathematics and science. The research products from the 
Research Group will serve as one of the lasting legacies of the MCTP. This strongly suggests that 
the MCTP’s model of a NSF funded project supporting research within itself is a viable model that 
calls for replication throughout the NSF and other funding agencies, particularly in critical areas 
such as mathematics and science teacher preparation projects. 



The researchers within the MCTP research team would like to acknowledge the ongoing 
support given to them by the MCTP Principal Investigators, Jim Fey, Genevieve Knight, John 
Layman, Tom O’Haver, and Jack Taylor, and the MCTP Executive Director, Susan Boyer. We 
also are very appreciative of the participation of the many faculty, teacher candidates, and 
cooperating classroom teacher participants in the MCTP research program. 

The first and second authors also would like to acknowledge the support to the 
MCTP Research Group provided by some talented and hardworking doctoral students in 
mathematics education: Amy Roth- McDuffie, Steve Kramer, Mary Ann Huntley, and 
Karen King. In addition, Gilli Shama, a visiting Israeli mathematics educator, assisted the 
Research Group with quantitative research analysis expertise during the 1995-1996 year. 

The preparation of this manuscript was supported in part by a grant from the

TEACHING THE NATURE OF SCIENCE IN A COLLEGE EARTH SCIENCE 
CLASS DESIGNED FOR PRESERVICE ELEMENTARY AND MIDDLE 
SCHOOL TEACHERS 

William Slattery, Wright State University 

The recent National Science standards emphasize that the training of preservice 
teachers include a component that leads to an understanding of the nature of science, and 
that can be translated into classroom practice (AAAS, 1989, 1994; NRC, 1996). This 
paper describes the pedagogic underpinnings of three exercises designed to impart the 
flavor of scientific inquiry into an Earth science course designed for preservice 
elementary and middle school teachers and details how the nature of science is taught 
from an Earth systems perspective. 

As part of an ongoing effort at Wright State University to simultaneously reform both 
K-12 education and the training of preservice teachers a suite of new courses were 
developed in 1995 and 1996 that would teach the science domain content that elementary 
and middle school teachers need to know, and model a variety of strategies and methods 
for teaching and learning science. A Foundations course that integrates mathematics and 
methods for investigating science was designed so students would come to the courses in 
Physics, Chemistry, Earth science and Biology with the fundamental skills necessary to 
pursue scientific investigations. Then these skills are enhanced in each of the four 
content courses. 

GL-345 Concepts in Geology deals with Geology, Oceanography, the Atmosphere, 
and Earth's place in space. Modules within the course are centered around rocks and 
minerals, the rock cycle, geologic time and fossils, the water cycle, and weather and 
climate. It is taught with a maximum of 24 students per section, and meets for six hours 
per week. There is a lab component for each major topic within each module, and topics 
are chosen from National science content standards and National Science Teacher 



ERIC 



348 



Association standards. For further details of the content of the course see Slattery 
(1996a). 

The Exercises 

Three exercises designed to reveal the nature of scientific inquiry are discussed in this 
section. The mechanics of two of the exercises have been described in Slattery (1996b 
and c). What follows is a brief description of the salient details of the exercises, followed 
by a discussion of the ramifications of the exercises for preservice elementary and 
middle school teachers. 

"The Box" 

The quarter begins with this cooperative group exercise The activity is a variation of 
the familiar mystery box. Cooperative groups of three students are given a small 
cardboard mailing box containing four Hershey Kisses Hugs, students working in groups 
are asked to: 

• make an educated guess about what is in the box before they get it 

• manipulate the box and make observations to determine how many objects are in the 
box, the shape of the objects, and the composition of the objects 

• discuss as a group if the observations led them to change their minds about what they 
thought was in the box before they got it 

• decide what technology would have made their task easier 
Discussion 

This exercise is, on its face, uncomplicated. Based on the size of the box (size here) 
students know that there are a multitude of objects that cannot be inside, but there are just 
as many different objects that could be. The only limit is of course, size. Students are able 
to make the observations needed to determine that there is more than one object in the 
box. Initially, they perceive that the objects in the box are of different shapes, based on 
hearing sliding and rolling within the box. These observations cause them to change 
their original guess about what was in the box. Since this is an Earth science class, they

usually think there is a rock in the box before they get it, and upon handling the box 
realize that the weight of the box precludes this. However, some cling to the belief that 
the box contains rocks, suggesting that perhaps I am engaging them in a discrepant event 
by placing a low specific gravity rock such as pumice in the box. What the groups have 
done in scientific terms up to this point is to form a working hypothesis, tested that 
working hypothesis by making specific observations, and then have amended the 
hypothesis based on their observations. Students rarely make the connection to the 
scientific terminology at this point, and I don't tell them until the exercise is completed. 
Class discussion revolves around the number of objects each group thinks is in the box, 
and the size and shape of the objects. Now it is time for the paradigm shift. Up to this 
point, most groups have not smelled the box, and if they did, most are unable to smell 
anything other than cardboard. If no group has already done so, I ask each group to 
vigorously shake the box for about ten seconds and then smell it. Usually, at least one, 
and sometimes several groups declare that they smell chocolate. This, I point out, is 
sometimes how scientific advances are made. Scientists will perform a novel experiment 
or observation and new information will emerge. Immediately, the class has a new model 
for what is in the box. But, what kind of chocolate is it? Is it a Mr. Goodbar, a Hershey 
miniature, a Hershey Kiss? Based on their observations of sliding and rolling within the 
box, they use their domain specific knowledge of candy to decide that Hershey Kisses are 
most likely to be in the box. This is the role of concepts in science. Without specific 
content facts about the size and shapes of candy bars, they would have difficulty 
progressing past this point. Fortunately though, their prior experiences with candy enable 
them to mentally scroll through the various candy shapes and come up with the most 
likely candidate. Technology such as CAT scans and X-rays are suggested as methods to 
corroborate their findings. This too, is an accurate scientific analogy, as models in science 
become stronger as different lines of evidence triangulate upon them. However, all the 
technology suggested cannot answer the question of the color of the wrappers. Are they

350 




the traditional silver, or pastel colors for the Spring Holidays, red and green for Winter, or 
are they striped? Some questions must wait for the advance of new technologies. A class 
discussion relating this exercise to the study of the Earth ensues. Students often relate the 
box exercise to studies of the interior of the Earth, and discuss the methods of 
determining the composition or and the nature of the crust, mantle and core. Some 
students realize that the study of the interior of the Earth can be studied by earthquake 
data and share this with the class. They also realize, that unlike the box, the Earth cannot 
be opened at the end of a scientists' experiments, so scientists are not sure about the 
composition and nature of the interior of our planet. We can however, use different lines 
of evidence to get close to what is reasonable. The collection of data is shown to be an 
integral part of the nature of science, and this exercise builds interest for what is to come. 
The next activity asks the students to collect earthquake data from the internet, and to plot 
that data for investigative purposes. 

A Near-real Time Earthquake Activity 

Preservice teachers will enter their professional careers in a far different world than 
their predecessors. Many classrooms will be linked to the internet and world wide web, 
and teachers will grapple with the challenge of using this resource for classroom 
instruction. Acknowledging this reality, a significant number of exercises in the Earth 
Science class require that the students access on-line information. The following is an 
example of a long term exercise (six weeks) that requires students to access on-line data 
and additionally allows them to understand how scientists use earthquake data to 
delineate tectonic plate boundaries of the Earth. Students are given a physiographic chart 
of the Earth, and are asked to access the United States Geological Survey's National 
Earthquake Information Service homepage at http://geology.usgs.gov/quake.shtml. They 
plot the longitude, latitude and depth of the earthquakes over a span of several weeks. 




351 



Discussion 

Most, but not all earthquake activity occurs at the margin of the plates. At the end 
of the exercise the student has at least partially recreated the classic figure in Earth 
Science textbooks that shows the plate boundaries of the Earth. They have learned how 
scientists use data in their investigations, and most importantly, the anomalous data 
points within plate boundaries are the jumping off place for class discussions of topics 
such as the New Madrid earthquake and What if... questions, focusing on (no pun 
intended) the possibility of earthquakes in areas that have not been tectonically active. 

The Greenhouse Effect 

The intemet/world-wide web is a largely untapped source of data that can be used 
to fashion exercises that expose students to elements of scientific inquiry, processing and 
analysis of data, and understanding that the real world is complex, with many variables 
interacting to produce a single measured parameter. Our class investigates the 
greenhouse effect during a two week period. The intemet/world-wide web is essential to 
our investigations. Table 1 is a summary of web sites, data, and tasks that are performed 
on-line.

sites such as Volcano World, they see that average global temperature drops when 
significant volcanic eruptions occur. They discover that volcanic ash prevents some solar 
energy from reaching the Earth, and that this has an effect on the temperature of the Earth 
system. Decreases in the monthly concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere

They begin to appreciate the interplay between the Earth's lithosphere, 
hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere, not by lecture, but by meaningful, minds-on 
activities. The web is searched to find opposing viewpoints, and the module is capped by 
group reports on the Greenhouse effect. 

Discussion 

Students have heard about global warming, but few have had a chance to 
judiciously assess the data for themselves, increase their own knowledge of this complex 
societal issue, actively search for opposing viewpoints, and use what they have learned to 
produce a presentation based on fact, not opinion. 



Conclusions 

The three exercises represent different modalities of teaching and learning the 
nature of science in an Earth science class for preservice elementary and middle school 
teachers. Materials range from decidedly low tech cardboard boxes to downloading data 
and text from the exponentially evolving intemet/world-wide web. There are however, 
common threads that run through all of them. The box exercise asks students to think 
about what might be in the box before they begin. These prior conceptions were usually 
influenced by rational thought processes, given the limitations of their prior knowledge. 

A subset (n=17) out of 104 students in six sections persisted in their belief that they 
were being subjected to a discrepant event In some cases, the students could not form 
working hypotheses until they were assured that this wasn't the case. This may have 
broad implications for the use of discrepant events as a tool in science education, and 
bears further investigation. The amending of prior conceptions is a key element in the 
earthquake and global warming exercises as well. Students were surprised to see how 
many earthquakes didn’t occur on plate boundaries, and this generated numerous 
questions about possible reasons. The variations in carbon dioxide concentration in the 
atmosphere led to discussions about the causes of these variations, and sometimes to a 
request for more "net time". The internet is inherently superior to archived information 
sources because sources can be accessed rapidly, will be used in their future classrooms, 
and because they like it. I cannot remember a class demanding to send a representative to 
the library to look something up so that a vigorous discussion of factual information 
could continue. 

The role of domain specific content is another common thread. Clearly, it is 
specifically a knowledge of candy bars that is needed when the paradigm shift takes place 
in the box exercise. A knowledge of the names of sports teams, or for that matter the 
American Revolution, just won't do. Similarly, content must be domain specific in the 
earthquake and global warming exercises. The exercises are a vehicle for the increase of 



content knowledge, as well as teaching the nature of science. Students inherently 
understand that reality, and have eagerly sought out the content needed to bolster their 
arguments in the global warming exercise. To remain economically competitive 
tomorrow, the students of today must be comfortable with the use of technology, and be 
scientifically literate. Since teachers teach as they have been taught, their future 
classrooms are more likely to produce scientifically, and technologically literate citizens.

This year's AETS conference focus on systemic reform of science education brings attention to the 
role of teachers and science educators while leaving out an important partner in education reform. 
Parents are a crucial contributor to the education of their children and they should have a role to 
play in lasting reform efforts. The triad of parent, teacher and child is more efficient and effective 
than any of these paired. 

Research advocating parental involvement is evident in the literature (Daisey & Shroyer, 
1995; Riley, 1994; Rillero, 1994). The benefits to parents, students and teachers are well 
documented. There are multiple reasons why parents should be involved in the education of their 
children (Epstein, 1987; Hester, 1989; Rillero, 1994; Rutherford & Billig, 1995). Some student 
benefits include improved behavior, increased achievement and motivation, and lower truancy 
rates. Parents feel more connected to the schools and their children. Teachers gain an ally who 
supports their efforts. Lists of suggestions for teachers and principals to increase parental 
involvement abound (Epstein, 1987; Hester, 1989; Rillero, 1994). Characteristics of projects 
which have successfully involved parents provide a starting point. This paper describes one way 
to substantively involve parents in elementary science instruction. It also gives guidelines for 
elementary methods instructors who may want to incorporate this approach in preservice 
education. The method has been successfully implemented in all 16 elementary schools of a 
midwestem school district. From the standpoint of the teachers and parents involved, it has been 
successful (Chidsey & Henriques, 1996; Dunkhase, Shymansky, Dunkhase & Jones, 1996; 
Grohe, 1996). 

Epstein (1987) suggests 16 ways to involve parents. Included on her list are: 

• Ask parents to read to their children regularly or to listen to the children read 
aloud.

• Loan books, workbooks, and other materials to parents. 

• Ask parents to get their children to talk about what they did that day in class. 

• Explain to parents certain techniques for teaching, for making learning 
materials, or for planning lessons. 

• Give a questionnaire to parents so they can evaluate their children's progress or 
provide some other form of feedback, (p. 8) 

Hester (1989) and Rich (1988) make similar suggestions. In addition to the materials sent home 
and suggested activities to be done at home, they focus on increased and better communications 
between parents and teachers. This ought to be done via phone calls, letters, meetings at night and 
during the day, and through classroom visitations. While there is ample evidence supporting the 
parental desire to be more meaningfully involved in their children's education, few parents know 
how to do so and few schools systematically attack the issue (Daisey & Shroyer, 1995; Rich, 
1988). These suggestions, along with guidelines for implementation are incorporated into the 
science bookbags discussed below. 

What Is A Science Bookbag? 

The science bookbags described here were designed as part of a district-university 
collaborative called Science: Parents, Activities and Literature (Science PALs). Science PALs is a 
four year teacher enhancement projected supported by the National Science Foundation and the 
Howard Hughes Medical Foundation. It is a collaborative effort involving all 16 elementary 
schools in the partner district. Science PALs is in its third year of implementation. Cadres of 
teachers join the project each year. The teachers go through extensive inservice programs during 
the summer and throughout the school year. The bookbags, put together by teams of teachers, are 
used at the start of a science unit to determine students pre-instruction science ideas about the unit 
topic. 

The bookbags consist of a children's story, an activity and an interview protocol for 
parents and children to complete together. The bookbag, which contains complete directions for 
the parent, is sent home before instruction begins on a science unit. The print material, usually 
fiction, is selected by the teacher teams when planning the district unit, and is related to the unit. 





either directly or peripherally. The interview questions address ideas in the story and the child's 
understanding of the science concepts involved. The interviews are short, containing only four or 
five questions. The parent's role is to gather and record their child's ideas. After completing the 
interview the parent and child do an activity together, the materials for which are included in the 
bookbag. The entire process takes roughly 30 minutes. , 

The information gathered during the interview is returned to the teacher along with the book 
and activity materials. The books and materials are used over and over as different classes start the 
unit. The teacher is then able to use the gathered information to guide and inform instruction. 
Science educators advocate a constructivist approach to teaching (e.g. Brooks & Brooks, 1993; 
Driver, Guesne, & Tiberghien, 1985; Yager, 1991). There are many merits to knowing what 
students think prior to instruction but it is unrealistic to think that am elementary teacher has the time 
to interview all his/her students before beginning a lesson. When the parents partner with the 
teacher they are gathering valuable information that would otherwise be unrecorded in any 
systematic way. The data collected by parents reasonably reflects their children's scientific 
understandings in most cases (Chidsey & Henriques, 1995). The quality of student responses is 
enhanced when teachers model informal questioning techniques for parents at school -based 
meetings prior to use with their children. 

Why a Bookbag? 

While many parents feel uncomfortable with science, they do feel comfortable with the idea 
of reading to their child. Language arts and reading are making their way into all disciplines. 
Literature is accepted as a valuable vehicle for teaching all subjects, not just language arts (Hope & 
Small, 1993). Advocates of using literature with science argue that the integration makes learning 
more relevant because it puts the science in a context that is more meaningful for young students 
(Brainard & Wrubel, 1993; Butzow & Butzow, 1989; Gertz, Portman, & Sarquis, 1996; Hope & 
Small, 1993; Mayer, 1995; Ross, 1994; Staton & McCarthy, 1994a, 1994b; Wiegmann, 1996). 
Sending home a bookbag with a science related story and a science activity seems to be an ideal 
solution to the problem of involving parents in a meaningful, non threatening manner. 




359 



The parent and child do the reading, interview and activity together. The ensuing dialog 
provides a starting point for future science related discussions. After completing bookbags with 
their children, parents are more likely to ask specific science related questions of their child in the 
following weeks. They are also more likely to discuss science during parent-teacher conferences 
(Shymansky, 1996). When parents can ask specific questions about their child's day both parent 
and child find the discussions to be more meaningful than the traditional "how was your day at 
school?" questions. The bookbag provides parents with that entree. 

Creating and Using Science Bookbags in Elementary Methods Classes 
Elementary methods students learn a great deal by putting together a science bookbag. 

Many prospective elementary teachers already have favorite children's stories but they have rarely 
looked at stories from the perspective of teaching science. When they begin to put together a 
science bookbag they are forced to look at the science unit holistically. They must decide the unit's 
major goals and this often requires looking to the Standards (NRC, 1996) or Benchmarks (AAAS, 
1993). Students then investigate misconception literature and assess misconceptions in their 
chosen books. Finally, they find appropriate literature connections which enhance the science unit. 

When a potential book has been found the methods student must analyze the story in terms 
of the science ideas presented. There is a debate as to whether the story must be scientifically 
accurate to warrant inclusion (Mayer, 1995; Ross, 1994). We take the stance that an inaccurate 
portrayal of science is an excellent starting point for instruction. When students become critical 
readers, questioning the ideas they see in print, they are on the way to becoming critical thinkers. 
When methods students look at the story from the perspective of science they begin to analyze the 
science ideas, ask questions and formulate potential experiments to test the ideas. 

Once the book is selected and analyzed in terms of scientific content, the methods student 
should then look through the Standards (NRC, 1996) and/or Benchmarks (AAAS, 1993) to see 
what big ideas are related to those presented in the book. The major ideas of a unit ought to be 
derived from the accepted standards for the grade level. The most effective stories will relate to 
those ideas.

Misconception literature is then examined so that the teacher will have an idea what his/her 
future students are likely to think about the given topic. The questions that comprise the interview 
will tap into these commonly held student ideas. This aspect of bookbag creation allows 
prospective teachers to purposefully look at misconception literature, thus applying the 
constructivist approaches which are stressed in our classes. 

Methods students then select an activity which is directly related to the story. Materials 
needed to do the activity are included in the bookbag along with directions for completing the 
activity. This phase of putting together a bookbag requires future teachers to locate an activity 
which could be easily and affordably done at home. As they look for an appropriate activity they 
are becoming familiar with the resources available to them. Clear directions for completing the 
activity must be written for inclusion. 

Putting together a bookbag requires methods students to communicate clearly with parents 
in writing as well as orally. Ideally, these future teachers will be holding a parent meeting where 
they will explain bookbag implementation, and they will need to be comfortable communicating 
verbally during this time. They will also need to write clearly because it is unlikely that all parents 
will attend a parent's night The directions included with the bookbag must be well-written enough 
to be able to stand alone. 

Practically speaking, the book, activity and interview questions will be sent home together 
and large zippered plastic bags work well for this purpose - all the materials fit inside and they can 
be reused. Numbering the bags enables the teacher to keep track of which students have returned 
their bag after completion. 

The process of putting together the bookbag synthesizes many of the skills that are desired 
in methods students who are about to become teachers. They must analyze the science content of a 
story and think about how that story will tie into the larger unit Students must examine the 
commonly held misconceptions related to the topic they will be teaching and find related activities 
to go with the story and the unit. Ideally, they will look for activities which challenge the specific 
misconceptions which their students have. Finally, preservice teachers must be able to 




361 



384 



communicate well. This process gets methods students thinking about science activities as ways to 
engage students physically and mentally. The literature connection is a comfortable starting point 
for prospective teachers and activities help to create a cohesive unit 

Implementing Science Bookbaes in an Elementary Classroom 

An elementary teacher who would like to incorporate science bookbags into the curriculum 
must follow the same steps as the preservice students. It has been most effective for teachers to 
hold a meeting with parents prior to sending home the bookbags. The meeting provides an 
opportunity for the teacher to explain the bookbag and the parent's role and it allows a time for 
parents to ask questions. The teacher should take the time to read through the story and model the 
interview and activity with the parents. When explicit instructions are given to parents about 
interviewing and the importance of follow up questions are stressed the results are more accurate 
and more helpful to the teacher (Chidsey & Henriques, 1996). 

Practicing teachers have several resources in addition to their school librarians to help them 
identify useful books. Many of the elementary science curricula include an annotated bibliography 
of children's books and helpful lists are included in journals and popular science magazines. For 
example, the March issue of Science & Children has a list of outstanding trade books each year, 
and Scientific American lists books for young scientists each December. There are also books 
devoted to linking science and literature (Brainard & Wrubel, 1993; Butzow & Butzow, 1989; 
Gertz & others, 1996). The teacher must look at the school's resources to determine if it is feasible 
to purchase a sufficient number of books so that one can be loaned to each student. Costs would 
be reduced if many teachers in a grade level shared the bookbag set. 

The teacher must then decide if there should be a meeting with the parents to discuss the 
bookbags or if it would be best to simply send them home. The answer will depend, in part, upon 
the parental population. We have determined that attendance at the Parent Meetings can be 
increased when teachers couple the science bookbag meeting with another event at school. It has 
been our experience that parents feel more comfortable with their role when they have participated 
in at least one parent meeting each year. Class parents, aids or volunteers will have to read to

children who do not complete the activity with an adult at home. Appendix 1 provides a checklist 
of steps for teachers putting together a parent meeting. 

Using a children's story to get students thinking and talking about science has many 
benefits for students, parents and teachers. The increased discussions about science gives it more 
importance and value in the eyes of the student. Parents realize that they can help their children 
learn science. Teachers gain an ally and an aide in the learning process. The bookbags get parents 
meaningfully involved. Response from parents, students and teachers has been overwhelmingly 
positive.

A ppendix 1: Teacher Checklist For Parent Meeting to Discuss Science Bookbass. 



Prior to the meeting: 

• Meet with school principal to establish date of Parent Meeting (it works well to couple this with 
a time parents are already at the school) 

• Draft with school principal his/her letter to parents. 

• Send home principal's letter approximately 2 weeks prior to Parent Meeting. 

• Prepare and make arrangements for printing and presentation all of the print materials you want 
to provide to parents during the meeting. 

• Select a date approximately 7 to 10 days prior to Parent Meeting to meet with room parent(s) to 
provide them with basic information, plans for the Parent Meeting, class list(s)(s) to aid the 
parents) in phoning each family to remind them of the Parent Meeting and to get a verbal 
commitment about attending the meeting. Allow parents 3-5 days to do the phoning and 
to return results to you. 

• Examine the results and determine how many child care providers will be needed. Make 
arrangements for the providers), room assignment, and activities to be done during the Parent 
Meeting by the provider(s). 

• During the week of the Parent Meeting, have each student prepare a personal not about 
the approaching Meeting and allow them to express their feelings about the program and how 
'eager' they are to complete the activities which the parent(s) will be learning about during the 
meeting. Send notes home. 

• Double-check on the materials you plan to give the parents. 

• Meet with the custodial staff to discuss special set-up needs for the room where the Parent 
Meeting will be held. 

• Make arrangements for any audio/video equipment which you desire to use during the Parent 
Meeting [some teachers find it useful to video tape the meeting so that the tape can be shared 
with parents who were unable to attend]. 

The Day o f the Meeting: 

• Day of the meeting: send home a reminder note to each family, assist/supervise the set-up of 
the room where the meeting will be held, call the care providers) with any last minute 
information they may need. 

• put up Welcome and Directions signs to the room where child care will occur. Organize the 
handout materials (bookbags) in a location where parents can readily locate and bring them into 
the meeting room.

• Make last-minute checks on audio/video equipment which you may be using during the 
presentation during the Parent Meeting. 

• Go home early to rest and prepare for returning to the school for the Parent Meeting. 

• Return to school and check that everything is, indeed, the way you want them to be for your 
presentation. 

• Be sure the care providers) have arrived and are ready to welcome the parents/children in the 
assigned room. 

• Welcome parents as they enter school, locate their print materials and find seats in the meeting 
room. 

• Begin meeting promptly at the time you have designated in all the communications you have 
had with parents. 

• Relax and realize all the preparations have been worthwhile as you enthusiastically talk about 
your science program and the parent connections which you are seeking using the materials 
which you are providing to them this evening. 

• Take time to thoroughly answer parent questions which may be asked during and after your 
presentation. Thank parents for attending the meeting. 

• At the end of the meeting, collect all assigned materials so you'll have a record of which 
families were not in attendance during the Parent Meeting, thank the care provider(s) and make 
arrangements for compensation if that has been agreed to, and take down any posters, etc. 
which you want to keep for reuse. 

AFTER THE MEETING: 

• The day after the Parent Meeting: thank the custodial staff for their assistance, send 
thank-you's to the room parents) for their help in making the Parent Meetings such a success, 
and make similar comments to the students as you begin class that day. 

• One week after the Parent Meeting students should be returning the bookbags and 
interview results. Arrange to have students read to if they did not do the activity and reading at 
home. 

• Collate results and use the information to plan your lessons.

USING VIDEO CASE STUDIES IN PRE-SERVICE SCIENCE 
TEACHER EDUCATION 

Marcia K. Fetters, The University of Toledo 

Using case studies in rich and meaningful ways 

We have all experienced days when, despite our “wonderful” lesson plans, things 
went poorly and we had to alter our plans and strategies mid-way through the lesson or 
spend time planning what we would do the next day. This is the part of teaching that is 
often invisible to the novice teacher. Novices don’t see the alternate plans the teacher had 
prepared, or the thought process involved in finding different pathways to teaching various 
concepts. They often come to methods classes expecting instructors to share with them 
“the best way” to teach a topic. Sometimes students bring with them strong memories of a 
particular strategy that they have seen a teacher use. Rarely do recognize or accept that 
there are multiple strategies or ways of approaching each topic area. 

Case study methods, common in medicine and law, are becoming more commonly 
used in education. Case materials (video and written) can provide students with practice in 
thinking about teaching in those ways. Several projects have developed video and or 
materials that were intended for (or could easily be used) in this proactive way (Martin & 
Marks 1995, EES/MPNE 1992, Private Universe Project 1995, NCRTL 1993, Warren & 
Rosebery 1994). This presentation will show some ways in which these materials can be 
used to help pre-service teachers think about teaching in more proactive ways. 

Rationale 

This method represents a departure from the ways in which case studies are commonly 
used. When pre-service teachers go through an education program they often read about 
classroom settings, watch video tapes of classroom settings, or participate in field 
experiences where student learning or achievement may or may not to appear to be 
maximized. As instructors, we ask them to analyze what they have read or seen, describe 




368 



the type of learning that has occurred, and propose ideas about what lead up to those events 
(Sykes & Bird, 1992). In our efforts to help pre-service teachers understand the 
philosophies behind various reform efforts and to help them be more open to modem ways 
of teaching and learning, we help them develop skills in observation, analysis and 
reflection. These are important skills, and during field experiences and student teaching we 
often evaluate them on these skills. The use of casestudies for this paper focuses on using 
moving pre-service teachers from the critical but passive “they” stance in this analysis, 
towards a stance in which pre-service teachers place themselves in the situations under 
examination, and suggest and/or document their own preferences for teaching in a variety 
of situations. 

Background 

One of the events that prompted my thinking about using clips of classrooms in this 
more proactive way was by watching and listening to my students reactions when they 
watched classroom segments. Often they would start their comments out by saying 
something like: “The teacher should have..” or “If the teacher had done...” or “It didn’t 
look like this teacher...” Comments were often critical in nature and sometimes showed 
that they really had not grasped the complexity of the context. 

When watching a clip of a scientific discussion in a bilingual classroom the first 
comments from the pre-service teachers were about how rude the students were by raising 
their voices and talking over each other. They did not recognize this as part of an argument 
or that different cultures have different accepted manners of speech. They had similar 
reaction other times when watching video clips of classrooms. The students were very 
quick to say what the teacher had done wrong -- but when pressed for alternatives they had 
difficulty responding. This echoed a difficulty that many student teachers have — when 
one strategy doesn’t appear to be working, most student teachers have a difficult time 
thinking about alternative ways of structuring the content to help their students better 





369 



understand the material. The following section highlights some of the materials that we 
have used with suggestions for assignments or activities. This list is not all inclusive and 
I’m hoping that those of us interested in exploring different uses of video casestudies can 
use this as the beginning of a conversation. 

Strategies 

The videotape that started me thinking about alternative uses when I was invited to 
pilot test some materials done by Doug Martin and Rick Marks. They developed a set of 
videotape cases in science and math as part of a National Science Foundation project. Two 
of the clips from the science tape “Refraction’’ and “Penny in a Cup” lend themselves 
particularly well for use in pro-active ways. The suggested questions included with the 
resource materials with the tape focused on teacher knowledge and student understanding. 
“Refraction” show a teacher explaining the concept of refraction to her students. Penny in 
a Cup” is from the same classroom and documents student understanding of refraction and 
their ability to apply this understanding to explain why the penny appears when water is 
added. The student drawing and interviews show the wide variety of ideas held by the 
students about the nature of light. My students were quick to point out what they thought 
was missing from the lesson on refraction that lead to some of the misconceptions 
highlighted by the penny in a cup activity. The assignment for the next class session was 
to write a lesson plan or set of plans for the following scenario: 

Imagine that instead of a video tape you had been an observer in the class you just 
saw. The school principal calls you that evening - the teacher has just been called 
out of town for a few days and since you are almost certified and have been in the 
room observing they would like you to teach the class the next couple of days until 
the teacher can return. What does your lesson plan look like — based on what you 
know about the current level of student understanding? 

The next class session student get in small groups and share their lesson plans. So far each 

time I’ve done this it has come as a surprise to the pre-service teachers that their lesson 

plans don’t all look alike. Most terms there a few individuals who also talk about how they 




370 



393 



had to go back and try to think through the process of refraction themselves and try to come 
up with reasonable explanations. 

This same scenario can be used with the video many of us use in our classes “A 
Private Universe.” Stop the tape midway through and ask the students to design a lesson 
plan for how to teach the phases of the moon. They can then compare this with what 
Heather’s teacher did. There are several clips in the new Private Universe Series that could 
also be used in this way. This past term I’ve started exploring similar uses for the “Sense 
Making in Science” video case studies developed my Ann Rosebery and Beth Warren 
(Rosebery & Warren, 1996). Elizabeth Cohen suggests similar types of questions for use 
with the companion tape to her book on groupwork (Cohen, 1994). 



Student Feedback 



Student feedback to these activities has been mostly positive. They find the task 
difficult, but useful. Following are some typical reactions to the assignment. These are 
excerpts from their class journals. 



“ Jennifer ” Spring 1996 

I couldn 7 believe that / really couldn 7 explain the phases of the moon. When / sat 
down to do my lesson plan for the assignment l pulled out my old books and 
looked at a lot of charts. / could identify things in the book - but I couldn 7 figure 
out how to put it into words that a student would understand. It was one of the first 
times that I really felt the pressure that teachers must feel every day. / knew that 
everyone else in the class was doing the same task and they would all catch things 
that I said wrong. I couldn 7 just sort of know it — I had to KNOW it. 

"John" Fall 1996 

When you told us we were going to watch a tape of students learning about 
refraction — I thought hey no problem this stuff I know. Unlike some of the earlier 
things that we did with photosynthesis. As a physics major I know optics. But 
when we saw all the different ideas the students had to describe the penny in a cup 
trick / was shocked. 1 would have taught the lesson just like the teacher on the tape 
but it was clear most of the kids didn 7 have a clue. It was the first time it really 
sunk in to me that / would have to be able to explain things in a variety of ways so 
that the students would understand. We 've been talking about it — but when I had 
to make uy> lesson plans to teach refraction — it became real. 

One of the things that happened in the methods class was that no longer were the 

lesson plans being written just to meet my needs. Students had real ownership in the 




371 



planning. In the beginning they seemed to write real generic lessons and when pressed 
would usually not strongly defend their choices. By using both video case studies and 
some examples of written case studies a context was set. The students had strong views of 
how and why they thought their strategies would work and by sharing those with others 
they also gained insight into some alternative. 

During student teaching students are asked to videotape themselves twice during the 
term and write up an analysis of their lesson. Some of them have asked if we couldn’t use 
their tapes in seminar and do a similar activity. They came to want the feedback and 
different ideas of their peers could provide. 

Next Steps 

I’m in the early stages of thinking about all the different ways that case studies, 
both written and video can be used in pre-service education and would really like to 
continue this dialogue with others who are trying or using them in their teaching. The 
attached reference list also includes a couple other sources I’ve used but not highlighted in 
this paper or presentation, and pieces that have shaped my thinking about the uses of case 
studies in pre-service education. I would be very interested in working with others have 
similar questions or in developing some rich materials for use in pre and in-service 
education

A old adage states, “I hear and I forget, I see and I remember, I do and I understand” 
(Woolnough, 1994; p.25), which seems to sum up, from a pupil’s perspective, difficulties that 
might be associated with science learning. These difficulties have not been ignored by researchers 
and the science education community. Teaching science through investigation improves students’ 
achievement, their attitudes towards science, mastery of science process skills, problem solving, 
and creativity (Shymansky, Kyle, & Alport, 1982). While “hands-on” activities can devolve into 
closed-ended recipes (Walberg, 1984), true open-ended inquiry can more closely approach the 
notion of “minds-on”. 

One difficulty for teachers that arises in the context of teaching for inquiry is that many 
teachers may not have experienced research or be familiar with the process of open-ended inquiry 
and presentation of the results of the inquiries. The National Science Education Standards 
(National Research Council, 1996), addresses this issue in the teaching and professional 
development standards. Teaching Standard A states that, ‘Teachers of science [should] plan an 
inquiry-based science program for their students” (p.30). Seemingly in response to the need of 
teachers to understand this, Professional Development Standard A states, “Professional 
development for teachers of science requires learning essential science content through the 
perspectives and methods of inquiry” (p.59). Thus in order to address the needs of the students for 
science inquiry, teachers themselves must be familiar with the process of scientific inquiry. 

Over the last decade, West Virginia University, Glenville State College, and other 
institutions have enjoyed a relationship with the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) 




374 



397 



in Green Bank, WV, providing research and inquiry-based experiences for inservice and 
preservice teachers. For the purposes of this paper, the term “institute” is used in reference to 1-2 
week long residential learning experiences, held at NRAO - Green Bank. NRAO is an active 
research institution, serving the international astronomical community with several radio 
telescopes. As most science teachers are not familiar with the details and activities of radio 
astronomy, the institutes provide a context in which many of the participants have a common 
baseline of understanding to participate in inquiry without bringing along specific biases. The 
main goals of the institutes have been: 

a) Teachers advancing their understanding of the work of scientists and experience 

scientific research. 

b) Ensure that participants recognize their research experience as a model for learning 

science in the classroom 

c) Assist inservice and preservice teachers in developing, implementing, and evaluating 

research projects for middle and high school students. 

d) Assess the effect on participants doing research and using research in their classrooms in 

regard to understanding the nature of science, attitudes toward science teaching and 

toward students and teaching. 

This AETS Conference session is designed to present several aspects of the institutes, from the 
perspectives of philosophies of science, inservice teachers’ needs, and the development of 
preservice science teachers. A more detailed description of the goals and practices of the institutes 
can be found in Appendix A. 

Setting and Approaches 

In addressing the goals stated above, participants spent time “on location” at NRA O-Green 
Bank, operating a 40-foot radio telescope which has been dedicated to educational pursuits. 
Participants were shown the rudiments of how to operate the telescope and then given a generalized 
research problem. Over the course of the institute, the participants then proceed to formulate 
research questions, collect and analyze data, and finally present such data to the group. During this 




375 



time, participants received lessons on fundamentals of radio astronomy, models of pedagogy, and 
how to recognize opportunities for student-oriented research during the academic year. 

Participants also received mentoring during the course of their investigation from resident radio 
astronomers and master science teachers who are familiar with the process of radio astronomy. 

Once an institute is completed, participants were expected to plan, develop, implement, and 
evaluate a student-centered inquiry-oriented scientific investigation in their home schools. 

Teachers received support from their peers and project staff through class visits and periodic 
feedback meetings. Several participants have gone on to present their classroom projects at state 

and national science teachers meetings. Samples of teacher-developed research projects can be 
found in Appendix B. 

In the third cycle of the project, preservice teachers were included in a similar process to the 
inservice teachers. One week prior to the start of the semester, middle grades and secondary 
science and methods students at West Virginia University and Glenville State College attended an 
abbreviated version of the inservice teacher institute. The preservice teachers represented multiple 
content areas in their prior coursework, but were typically seeking a general science-biology dual 
certification. All of these preservice teachers were taking the methods course in the upcoming 
semester, so participation in the institute was a part of the course requirements. About half of the 
participants anticipated completing their student teaching in the following semester, while the 
remainder still had course requirements to complete prior to student teaching. 

As the institute for preservice teachers is shorter than the institute for inservice teachers 
(one week vs. two weeks for the inservice teachers), the science education component (i.e. 
pedagogy, etc.) was moved into the methods course. The emphasis for the preservice institutes 
was then placed on the research project participation at NRAO-Green Bank. In addition, the 
preservice teachers were to begin the development of their own research projects. During the 
methods course, the preservice teachers were expected to and received assistance in fully 
articulating their plans for open-ended student research projects. The description of this 
assignment is found in Appendix C. Critical components of this plan were the inclusion of the 




376 393 



research project within the secondary science curriculum, as referenced by the West Virginia 
Science Curriculum Framework or the National Science Education Standards, the identification of 
variables, research questions, and a 10-day sketch plan for implementation. 

The plans developed by the preservice teachers were intended to be implemented within 
their student teaching placement. This implementation was with the support of project staff and 
their student teaching supervisor, and with the cooperation of their supervising teacher. Every 
attempt was made to place the student teachers with cooperating teachers that had attended the 
inservice institute. The preservice teachers received support in the form of project development 
and design, equipment needs and observation and data recording. Difficulties in implementation 
that have been identified and dealt with have been: (1) reconciling the project plan within the place 
m the curriculum that the student teachers find themselves, and (2) the cooperating teacher was 
unfamiliar with the process of the research project and skeptical of the implementation. Current 

efforts to improve the project implementation by the preservice teachers have targeted these 
impediments. 

Results 

Well over 300 inservice and nearly 100 preservice teachers have participated in the 
institutes since their inception. A total of 32 states have been represented. Periodic contact with 
the participants have yielded data that underscore the positive effects of the programs. Evaluation 
data was originally restricted to qualitative sources, such as self-report journals, concept maps, etc. 
While these lent much insight to the process of research concept development, they did not provide 
us with evidence of substantive pre-post institute change. Therefore, we resolved to use more 
quantitative measurements in the third phase of the institutes. 

The literature was reviewed for instrumentation that might be useful for evaluating the 
program. While we found some limited instrumentation, we were not able to find the kind of 
measurement coverage we sought. Once major concepts representing the institutes were 
identified, specific indicators of each concept were then identified and thus translated into items. 
Items were grouped into instruments and critiqued by program staff. A battery of eight (8) 





377 



instruments were put together. Five of these are discussed here: Institute Evaluation (IE), 
Research Self Assessment (RSA), Implementation of a Research Project (IRP), Nature of Science 
and Science Teaching (NSST), and Student Attitude Toward Science (SATS). Reliability analyses 
were done on eight groups of RETP participants (n=60) from 1994-1996 and an outside group of 
200 teachers from the West Virginia Science Teachers Association. The SATS was tested with a 

group of 200 West Virginia middle and high school students. The remaining three instruments are 
still under development and testing. 

The IE calls for teachers to evaluate the quality of the program, the value of the research 
experiences, and the degree to which the program experiences have prepared them to implement the 
research process in their classroom. The RSA was designed to assess the research skills, attitudes 
and confidence of the teachers. The IRP assesses the kinds of concerns teachers might have about 
implementing the research process in their classroom as well as the degree to which individual 
teachers hold concerns about implementing the research process. The NSST assesses the degree to 
which teachers hold constructivist orientation toward science and science teaching. The SATS 

assesses students' orientation to science, science classes, and their perceptions of what happens in 
their classroom. 

Among the inservice teachers (n=34), 89% have reported more student involvement in 
investigations, 87% have reported allowing students to design their own investigations, 78% 
reported that concepts are explored in more depth, and 75% report that they use a variety of ways 
to evaluate student performance, such as through project presentations and portfolios. Many of the 
participants reported that they will move away from “cookbook” science instruction, emulate the 
processes of science and action of scientists, and they feel empowered to actively conduct research. 

The preservice component, while much newer than the inservice component, has yielded 
similar results. The preservice teachers (n=26) were all students that were scheduled to take a 
science methods course in the following semester, prior to student teaching. Data were analyzed 
using PC-SAS. Preliminary results of one- and two-way ANOVAs (at the time of writing) indicate 
that there was a significant change in how preservice teachers view their capacity to conduct 



scientific research ( p<0.05 ), and their attitudes towards science and science teaching ( p<0.01 ). 

The results also showed that while there was no significant change in their concerns about 
implementing a research project in the classroom, they were not overly concerned about 
implementing a project in the first place. On the evaluation of the experience, the preservice 
participants rated the institute between 3.3 and 3.6 on a 1-4 scale. Journals kept by the students 
revealed that while initially they were apprehensive about the experience in general they expressed 
more confidence in themselves as researchers. This confidence has extended into the classroom as 
they participated in student teaching. 

Conclusions 

Overall, it appears that the goals of the program were being and are continuing to be met by 
both the preservice and inservice teachers. Based on the success of the program, future proposed 
projects will involve K-12 teachers linked to systemic reform efforts nationwide. Also under 
development are plans to involve high school teachers and students in international astronomical 
research involving the Green Bank Interferometer at NRAO-Green Bank. It is evident that learning 
science in the context of scientific research has empowered teachers to feel confident in their 
abilities to allow students to construct real and personal understandings of science. Given these 
enhanced capacities, the historical incongruence between “school” science and “real” science may 
diminish more rapidly.

THE NATIONAL SPACE GRANT AND FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM: 
NATIONAL MATHEMATICS, SCIENCE, AND TECHNOLOGY 
EDUCATION STANDARDS 

Michael Odell, National Aeronautics and Space Administration 

The National Space Grant College and Fellowship Program 

A Nation at Risk in 1983 focused national attention on the American educational system. 
Other reports followed, describing the failures of the educational system and the implications for 
America’s economic future. As the economies of the industrialized nations shift toward advanced 
technology manufacturing, and services, information and communications technologies, the jobs 
available will require increasingly higher levels of education. NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin 
at the 1996 Space Grant Conference agreed, saying there is a revolution taking place in technology; 
50% of the U.S. jobs will be in the information processing arena which requires increase education 
in mathematics, science, and technology. In response to the many reports criticizing American 
education, former President George Bush and the Governors Council, chaired by then-Govemor 
Bill Clinton, announced six national education goals. These goals are being implemented under 
President Clinton’s administration and the U.S. Department of Education’s Goals 2000 program. 

Of particular interest to NASA is Goal 4: “By the year 2000, U.S. students will be first in 
the world in science and mathematics achievement” The American space program is dependent on 
the educational system to produce quality scientists, mathematicians, and engineers to carry out 
NASA’s strategic mission. 

In response to the crisis in mathematics education, the National Council of Teachers 
of Mathematics (NCTM) released Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for school 
mathematics. These standards reflect a consensus of mathematicians and 




386 



mathematics educators of how mathematics curriculum must be reformed. Emphasis is 
placed on active mathematics learning, based on students’ natural curiosity. NCTM in 
1991 released a companion standards on the teaching of mathematics. 

Science educators followed the lead of NCTM and have developed national 
standards for science. The American Association for the Advancement of Science 
(AAAS) released in 1989 Science for All Americans. This report describes Project 2061, 
a plan to determine long-term science and mathematics needs of students. Project 2061 
has identified a small number of common themes, such as constancy and scale, on which 
future curricula would be based. AAAS released in 1995 Project 2061 Benchmarks, 
which describe what every student should know in grades K-4, 5-8, and 9-12. The 
National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) supports Science for All Americans and 
developed a plan to reform secondary science education. Scope, Sequence, and 
Coordination eliminates the traditional layer cake curriculum and science is taught in a 
manner that identifies the connections between the science disciplines. The National 
Research Council (NRC) released in 1995 The National Science Education Standards. 
They present a framework for excellence and systemic reform in science education. The 
Technology For All Americans Project is currently developing standards for technology 
education. The technology standards should be released for public comment and review 
in 1997. Unlike many nations, the U.S. does not have a national curriculum. State 
adoption of national standards is voluntary. In an effort to promote the National 
Education Goals, the U.S. Department of Education has initiated Goals 2000 to provide 
states with funding to develop state frameworks for improving education. Most states 
have developed state frameworks for education; however, not all have adopted national

410 



standards. Because of NASA’s need for experts in science, mathematics, and technology, 
there is an interest at NASA to support the adoption and implementation of national 
standards in science, mathematics, and technology education. 

The National Space Grant College and Fellowship (NSGC&FP) program is in a 
unique position to support standards. NSGC&FP program, modeled after Federal Land 
Grant and Sea Grant university programs, was mandated in 1988 with passage of the 
NASA Authorization Act. Like Land Grant, Space Grant has a presence in every state, 
Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia, with over 580 affiliates including universities 
and colleges, business and industry, and government. The affiliate membership has a 
large stake in improved science, math, engineering, and technology education. This 
provides the rationale for their involvement in systemic reform. Table 1 summarizes the 
composition of the consortia.

Approximately 20% of Space Grant activities are K- 12 related. Space Grant 
programs serving both teachers and students, provide good examples of higher education 
working well with local school systems. Subsequently, the Space Grant consortia have 
been very successful in leveraging funds that promote NASA-related science education. 
During the period 1992-94, the consortia leveraged $16.5 million for over 1300 
precollege projects. Many of these projects targeted persons from underrepresented 
groups and contain mentoring or role modeling components. After the release of science 
and mathematics standards, NASA’s Education Division through the NSGC&FP was

provided an opportunity to facilitate awareness, adoption, and implementation of national 
standards. 

By participating in the Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the 
Environment (GLOBE) program, and NASA’s Mission to Planet Earth (MTPE) strategic 
enterprise to train teachers to teach interdisciplinary science Space Grant affiliates are 
modeling programs that reflect the standards. The GLOBE program, an outgrowth of 
Vice President A1 Gore’s continuing interest in the environment, exemplifies the spirit 
and intent of the standards. 

The GLOBE program, announced on Earth Day, April 1994, is an international 
science and education program that joins students, teachers and scientists to study the 
global environment and the Earth as a system. The GLOBE mission is to enhance the 
environmental awareness of individuals worldwide, increase scientific understanding of 
the Earth, and improve achievement in science and mathematics education. Students 
perform hands-on environmental science, make environmental measurements at or near 
their schools and send data electronically to a GLOBE data processing center. The 
student data are made available to scientists who analyze the data and provide 
information back to the students through visualizations. Since the GLOBE program was 
announced, over 2,500 US schools and 40 countries have registered. The GLOBE public 
sector partner is a U.S. Government interagency program involving the National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration, NASA, National Science Foundation, Environmental 
Protection Agency, and the Departments of Education and State. In December 1994, the 
United Nations endorsed GLOBE and encouraged nations to participate. The 
international GLOBE partners include: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Benin,

At the state consortium level, a review of currently funded K-12 projects 
sponsored by Space Grant has been completed. Individual projects are now being 
evaluated to determine if they meet the National Standards, particularly in the areas of 
teacher and preservice teacher enhancement. To further facilitate use of the standards, the 
evaluation of state consortia education projects has changed. In 1996, Space Grant 
affiliates will have to describe how their education programs meet the national standards. 
This will be accomplished through Space Grant’s Internet reporting system. 

NASA’s Education Division is funding a new initiative, Project NOVA, to create 
change in higher education science, mathematics, and engineering courses. Space Grant 
institutions are participating in this program. This project promotes the development of 
interdisciplinary teams of university faculty to develop integrated interdisciplinary 
introductory courses for preservice teachers. At the center of this program is adherence to 
the national standards. As a result of the NSGC&FP consortia, science education reform 
is supported throughout the U.S.

DEVELOPMENT OF AN INFORMAL LEARNING ASSAY

Introduction 

Research suggests that students’ life experiences are important in the development of their 
science knowledge and social skills (Resnick, 1987). With children spending 85% of their time, 
sleep excluded, outside the classroom (Medrich et al., 1982), the types and frequencies of activities 
in which children are engaged during this time may have profound effects on their abilities in 
school and functioning in society. Working on hobbies, reading, performing domestic chores and 
participating in sports, coupled with the social interaction involving peers and adults, are a few of 
the myriad of activities that may contribute to students’ learning through informal experiences. 

The idea that learners use personal experiences to construct knowledge of the world around 
them is basic to the constructivist view of intellectual development. Experiences (physical, logical- 
mathematical), cognitive conflict and social interaction are important components of learners 
constructing such knowledge (Piaget, 1964; Rogoff, 1990; Vygotsky, 1978, 1986). These 
components are distinctive features of childrens’ informal or out-of-school activities. 

Lawson (1988) found that interaction with perceived authorities (e.g., adults, books, 
television) was the primary source of early acquisition of biological knowledge in elementary 
students. Further, this knowledge was acquired by gradual accretion primarily through informal 
experiences. Similar research demonstrating the modification of domain-specific knowledge 
through informal experiences is common in the literature (Bar et al., 1994; Brickhouse, 1994; 
Bryant & Marek, 1993; Carter & Jones, 1994; Lee et al., 1993; Lewis & Linn, 1994; Marek, 
Cowan & Cavallo, 1994; Odom & Barrow, 1995; Rice & Feher, 1987; Shepardson, Moje & 
Kennard-McClelland, 1994; Strommen, 1995; Sunal & Sunal, 1991; Westbrook & Marek, 1991, 
1992). Unfortunately, few studies exist concerning the more critical question of how students’ 
differing experiential backgrounds can be identified and measured. 

Schibeci and Riley (1986) examined the influence of the informal learning environment of 
the home on science achievement in 673 seventh-graders. The researchers used responses from a 



3 

ERIC 



393 



four-item questionnaire as a measure of students’ home environment. A sample item from the 
questionnaire included: Is there an encyclopedia in your home? Data from this assessment was 
used to conclude that the home environment had a substantial influence on science achievement. 

Zuzovsky and Tamir (1989) examined the amount of variance in science achievement that 
was explained by variables of the home environment in a study of 2,599 elementary students. In 
this study, socio-economic status (SES) of the students was used as a measure of home variables. 
The SES of each student was measured by evaluating four variables: years of formal education of 
the mother, years of formal education of the father, number of siblings in the family, and number 
of books at home. The contribution of home variables to science achievement was found to 
increase when achievement was measured on topics not related to the school curriculum. 

In a study that examined behaviors identified as important indicators of informal science 
learning, Tamir (1990) studied a total of 544 tenth-grade students in Israel and South Africa. The 
behaviors identified as important indicators of informal science learning included: after-school 
conversations of what was learned in school, watching television, listening to the radio, reading, 
and performing other science-related activities. Data were collected through mailed questionnaires 
to a number of schools. Each of the four behaviors were found to be positively correlated to each 
of the following: relationship of school science to everyday life, attitudes toward science, parental 
occupations, school environment, intentions for continuing science study, and career ambitions. 

Evans, Baumert and Geiser (1995) developed an instrument to assess the out-of-school 
experiences of fourth-graders. A total of 517 students were included in the study, 195 from the 
U.S. and 322 from Germany. The instrument consisted of several specific questions for each of 
five domains: mechanical/technical, household, nature, creative, and musical. Examples of the 
types of questions used in the study included: Do you use an electric drill or saw? and Do you use 
sewing scissors or measuring tape? This information, along with data from self-efficacy, 
motivation and science achievement measures, was used to show that if school assessment 
measures included the household experiences of students, then those with high involvement in 
household activities would have higher control beliefs and higher science achievement. 

The methods used to assess informal learning environments vary widely. Little progress 
has been made toward completing a comprehensive and reliable instrument to quantify students’ 
informal learning environments. Yet, experiential learning and its influence on cognitive and 



O

394 



417 



affective aspects of students of all ages is frequently cited in the science education literature. 

Science education literature is replete with statements concerning students’ informal 
learning experiences and their possible influence on experimental results. A review of one year of 
Journal of Research in Science Teaching (1995) showed that nearly every issue contained at least 
one article with statements to this effect (Baker & Leary, 1995; Greenfield, 1995; Gumey, 1995; 
Korthagen & Lagerwerf, 1995; Kyle, 1995; Lee, Fradd & Sutman, 1995; Lumpe & Staver, 1995; 
Roychoudhury, Tippins & Nichols, 1995; Strommen, 1995; Watson, Prieto & Dillon, 1995; 
Watters & English, 1995). Before statements such as these can be substantiated, an instrument is 
required that reliably measures students’ informal learning experiences. 



Problem Statement 

The purpose of this study was to develop an instrument to reliably quantify middle school 
and high school students’ informal learning experiences. To be a useful tool to teachers and 
researchers, the instrument should be easy to administer and score, be useful with ethnically and 
culturally diverse student populations, and have the “flexibility” to be used across the disciplines. 



Defining Informal Learning 

Most science curricula include only that knowledge to be acquired in the classroom within a 
systematic educational setting (e.g., primary and secondary schools, technical schools, colleges, 
universities). Through these curricula, educating students takes place in organized, systematic 
ways. The learner and teacher interact with the prescribed intent of promoting learning. A set 
agenda is implemented and little, if any, importance is ascribed to childrens’ experiences outside 
the classroom (Osborne & Wittrock, 1983). In this setting attendance is compulsory, subject 
matter is structured by a teacher, motivation is primarily extrinsic and some type of assessment is 
expected (Tamir, 1990). The learning that takes place is termed “formal” due to the highly 
structured nature of the environment in which it occurs. 

Learning that takes place in settings outside of the classroom is termed “informal” 
(Maarschalk, 1988; Tamir, 1990). Informal learning environments are less structured than the 





395 



formal classroom setting and management of the learning is shifted from the teachers to the 
students (Tamir, 1990). Informal learning may occur in institutions (e.g., museum, zoo); 
organizations (e.g., Boy/Girl Scouts, Junior Achievement); or everyday situations (e.g., watching 
television, taking piano lessons, working on hobbies, shopping for clothes). For the purposes of 
this study, the informal learning environment is the sum of activities that comprise the time 
students are not in the formal classroom in the presence of a teacher. 



The Context of This Study 

Most science education research examines some aspect of the formal classroom 
environment. The lack of educational research on informal learning is substantiated by Lucas 
(1991) who completed a review of informal science learning articles published from 1983 to 1991. 
He found 163 entries with nearly every article dedicated strictly to museum research. Only a few 
studies were actually reports on the process of learning science through informal activities other 
than museum visits. Museum visitation research is one area of informal learning that has shown a 
tremendous increase in the science education literature (Dierking & Falk, 1994; Ramey-Gassert, 
Walberg & Walberg, 1994). This is presumably due to the large increase in numbers of science 
museums as well as ease of observing and testing museum patrons. However, the majority of 
childrens’ nonschool time is spent on informal activities unrelated to museum activities. This time 
is unaccounted for in science education research due to the difficulty of evaluating such 
heterogeneous subjects, learning environments, activities, and everyday learning situations. Aside 
from museum studies, research on informal learning is not as researcher friendly as the data 
gathering for research in the traditional classroom arena. However, considering the potential 
impact these out-of-school activities may have on student learning in school, a greater 
understanding of informal learning may have profound implications for the educational 
community. 

This paper describes the instrument development portion of a larger study which was 
designed to examine relationships among informal science learning experiences, teaching 
procedures in the formal science classroom environment, and scientific reasoning ability. This 

I 

investigation has resulted in a reliable and valid instrument, the Informal Learning Assay (ILA), for 




396 4|9 



assessing students’ informal learning activities. 



Developing the ILA 

Content Validity 

Initial construction of the ILA began by designing questions to assess students’ 
involvement in a wide variety of informal activities (e.g., hobbies, sports, clubs, travel, 
television). The content-related validity of the ILA was established by a panel of experts. The 
panel included two science education researchers with a total of 22 years experience in educational 
research, two middle school science teachers with a total of approximately 40 years of science 
teaching experience, and an educational psychologist experienced in assessment techniques. 
Members of the panel suggested, 1) the addition of questions assessing students’ involvement in 
church youth groups and volunteer work, and 2) identifying the number of siblings in a family. 
Following these changes, the panel agreed that the ILA was appropriately formatted for middle 
school and high school students and comprehensively assessed their informal learning experiences. 
The ILA was field tested to further assess validity through student interviews and to assess 
reliability. 

Field Testing 

The ILA was administered in September/October of the academic school year to 2,128 
students enrolled in sixth-, seventh-, eighth-, ninth-, and tenth-grade science classes. Students 
were from nine middle schools and two high schools in a Midwestern state. Schools were located 
in rural, suburban and urban settings and ranged in size from very small, with approximately 50 
students per grade level, to very large, with approximately 325 students per grade level. Students 
from eighteen female teachers and thirteen male teachers participated in the study. Teaching 
experience among these thirty-one teachers ranged from 2 to 26 years and averaged 10.6 years. 

The student sample consisted of the following percentages by grade: 15.9%, sixth-grade; 
19.1%, seventh-grade; 28.3%, eighth-grade; 11.7%, ninth-grade; and 25.0%, tenth-grade. The 
sample included African Americans (6.5%), Asian Americans (3.8%), Whites (79.1%), Hispanics 
(2.5%), Native Americans (5.8%), and students classifying themselves as ethnically mixed 
(2.2%). Female students made up 51.5% of the sample and males made up 48.5%. Students’ 




397 



420 



grades in science for the previous year were 42.5% “A,” 35.8% “B,” 15.7% “C,” 4.6% “D,” and 
1.4% “F.” 

The final version of the ILA consisted of 41 questions. Nineteen items were multiple 
choice and required students to indicate the extent of their involvement in various informal 
activities. Nineteen items required yes/no responses. Three items required students to fill-in-the- 
blanks. Directions at the beginning of the ILA instructed students to circle or write the appropriate 
response for each item in the space provided on the instrument. 

Questions on the ILA were separated into seven categories for the purpose of describing the 
instrument. These categories included: social activities with family and/or friends; activities done 
alone; school-related activities; lessons, classes or group activities not school-related; work and 
domestic chores; travel; and general. 

Fifteen ILA items assessed students’ involvement in social activities with family and/or 
friends. See Table 1, items 8, 12, 14 and 35, for examples. Ten multiple choice questions 
investigated patronage of restaurants, public libraries, movie theaters, and community parks; 
visiting attractions such as sporting events, natural areas, museums, and amusement parks; 
frequency of bicycle riding, skateboarding or roller blading; and with whom they go shopping for 
clothes and groceries. Four questions required yes/no responses. These items investigated 
receiving help with homework, running family errands, participating in sports, and the presence of 
siblings. One fill-in question required students to list the four most common things they do with 
friends. 

Six questions on the ILA assessed students’ involvement in activities done alone. See 
Table 1, items 2 and 4, for examples. Three questions were multiple choice and investigated the 
time students spend reading books and magazines, watching television and listening to the radio. 
Two fill-in questions required students to list favorite television programs and the four most 
common things they do alone. One yes/no question assessed involvement with hobbies. 

One multiple choice question (Table 1, item 17) assessed students’ involvement in school- 
related activities. Students indicated past or present involvement in school-related activities by 
circling the appropriate choices from a list of eight provided. Space was provided for students to 
record activities not mentioned in the list. 

Four questions on the ILA assessed students’ involvement in lessons, classes, or group 



O 

ERIC 



398 



421 



activities not school-related. See Table 1, items 18 and 22, for examples. Three yes/no response 
items assessed involvement in Scouting, Future Farmers of America or 4-H, and church youth 
groups. One question was similar to the school-related activities item except that twelve, 
nonschool-related activities were listed. 

Three questions assessed students’ involvement with work and domestic chores. See 
Table 1, item 27, for an example. Two yes/no response items investigated student involvement 
with paying jobs outside the home and volunteer work. One question required students to circle all 
domestic chores, from a list of fifteen provided, they regularly performed. Space was provided for 
students to record chores not mentioned in the list. 

Six questions assessed students’ travel experiences. See Table 1, items 39 and 41, for 
examples. All items required yes/no responses and surveyed their history of domestic and 
international travel/living. 

Six items on the ILA were general questions not related to each other or to previously 
mentioned groups of questions. See Table 1, items 20 and 28, for examples. Three yes/no 
response items investigated receiving an allowance, and possessing a personal home computer and 
a library card. Three multiple choice questions assessed the time students spend using a computer 
and shopping for clothes and groceries.

Throughout the field testing the ILA was administered by the researcher or by the 
classroom teacher in the presence of the researcher. All teachers agreed that the information 
provided by the ILA would be useful to them, generally stating the more they know about their 
students the more effectively they can teach. Specifically, most teachers stated that the usefulness 
of understanding students’ experiential background included, 1) knowing what type of examples 
and demonstrations to provide in class so students would better understand the current science 




400 



topic, and 2) being able to equitably separate students into cooperative groups. For some teachers 
this meant grouping students with similar experiential backgrounds; and for other teachers it meant 
grouping students with different experiential backgrounds so that they could learn from each other. 
Scoring 

Scores on the ILA could range from a low of zero to a high of approximately fifty. The 
upper limit is variable since some items on the ILA allow students to receive additional points by 
indicating their involvement in activities not listed. Responses to most items on the ILA were 
scored so that either a “one” or a “zero” was added to a student’s total score. On all yes/no items a 
“yes” response received one point and a “no” response received a zero. 

Multiple choice questions consisted of four types: 1) amount of time spent on an activity, 2) 
with whom time is spent, 3) where time is spent, and 4) identifying activities which may occupy 
free time. Responses indicating a minimal amount of time spent on an activity were scored a zero. 
Responses indicating more frequent time spent on an activity received one point. For example 
(Table 1, item 2), a response of “between 0 to 1 hour” received a zero while a response of 
“between 1 to 3 hours,” “between 3 to 6 hours,” or “more than 6 hours,” received one point. In 
Table 1, item 14, a response of “a few times a year or less” received a zero while a response of “a 
few times a month” or “once a week or more” received one point. For the purpose of this study, 
discrimination was needed only for dichotomous responses. For example, between 0 to 1 hour is 
essentially not sufficient to contribute to learning whereas over one hour would provide adequate 
engagement in learning. However, the range of choices were included to provide avenues for 
future research. 

Multiple choice questions assessing with whom time is spent were of two types. One type 
of question included responses indicating a lack of social interaction (Table 1, item 8). A response 
of “by myself’ received a zero. Responses indicating time spent with “friends” or “brothers and 
sisters” received one point. Conversely, scoring of the second type of question (Table 1, item 31) 
reflected the high degree of decision-making involved in shopping alone. A response of “with 
adult” received a zero while a response of “alone” received one point since the evaluation of 
various elements associated with a purchase rested solely with the student. 

One multiple choice question assessed where students and their friends spend time together 
(Table 1, item 12). A response of “in your own house or yard” received a zero while a response of 




401 



“in friends’ houses or yards,” “in a park,” or “in a shopping mall” received one point since 
activities at these locations might encourage social interaction to a greater degree than in their own 
house or yard. 

Two multiple choice questions identified activities which could occupy students’ time. See 
Table 1, item 17, for an example. Participation in school-related activities (e.g., band, school 
newspaper, Student Council) and lessons or classes not school-related (e.g., martial arts, acting, 
sports clinics) likely encourage social interaction since these activities are led by adults and involve 
cooperative groups. One point was added to a student’s ILA score for each item circled or written 
in the space provided at the bottom of these two questions. 

Conversely, activities such as domestic chores (e.g., doing laundry, feeding pets, washing 
dishes) and visiting attractions (e.g., sporting events, amusement parks, museums) are not as 
likely to expose students to cognitive challenges or extensive social interaction. The multiple 
choice question assessing involvement in domestic chores required at least four chores to be circled 
to receive one point. Responses with fewer than four chores circled received a zero. The multiple 
choice question assessing involvement in visiting attractions required at least three attractions to be 
circled to receive a point. Responses with fewer than three attractions circled received a zero. 
Multiple responses were required for a point to be awarded on these questions since the activities 
mentioned are short-term events and therefore cognitive challenges and social interactions are 
limited. However, numerous exposures to these informal events likely introduces students to 
some positive cognitive and social interactions. The number of activities needed for awarding 
point values to these two items was determined so that equivalent informal learning opportunities 
were represented. 

As a result of the scoring procedure, a high score on the ILA indicated an enriched informal 
learning environment with frequent exposure to experiences that provide cognitive challenges and 
social interactions. Alternatively, a low score on the ILA indicated an impoverished informal 
learning environment with infrequent exposure to experiences that provide cognitive challenges and 
social interactions. 

Students required between 15 to 35 minutes to complete the ILA. Sixth-graders required 
the most amount of time to complete the instrument while tenth-graders required the least amount 
of time. Scoring of each ILA was completed by the researcher and required about one minute per

402 



425 



data sheet. Scores for each question were keyed into a computer and were analyzed using the 
SYSTAT/Mac (Wilkinson, Hill & Vang, 1992) statistical package. 

Validity and Reliability 

Scores on the ILA for the 2, 128 students ranged from 0 to 46. The distribution of scores 
approximated a normal curve with a mean of 22.57 and a standard deviation of 5.07. Table 2 
shows the corresponding values for each grade and totals. The internal-consistency of the 
instrument was estimated using the split-half reliability estimate and Spearman-Brown formula 
(£=.82).

Two students from each of five different categories of ethnic origin (i.e., African 
American, Asian American, White, Hispanic, Native American) were interviewed following 
completion of their ELA. All ten students had the same understanding of each question on the 
instrument. Results of these interviews concurred with the findings of the panel of experts. The 
ILA was determined to be, 1 ) useful with ethnically and culturally diverse student populations, and 
2) an inclusive assessment of students’ informal learning experiences. 



Discussion and Implications 

The informal learning experiences of children are being recognized in the education 
research literature. However, a reliable instrument that extensively assesses students’ informal 
learning has yet to be introduced. This study has produced such an instrument, the ILA. 




403 



Mean ILA scores for students in each grade were within a range of 21.8 to 23.2 indicating 
student informal activity remained similar from middle school through tenth-grade. This was the 
initial use of the ILA, therefore, it is difficult to assess how these average scores would compare to 
other student samples. However, the highest score from this sample was 46, indicating students’ 
potential for increased contact with informal learning opportunities is great. Future studies using 
the ILA will explore possible differences in the informal learning environments of diverse student 
populations. 

While the ILA may be useful to classroom teachers, it was constructed primarily as a 
flexible tool for research in science education. This instrument could serve as a vehicle to initiate 
research in science education topics where it is difficult to obtain reliable quantitative data of the 
nature generated by the ILA. The ILA provides a useful means of answering questions such as: 
What are the relationships among gender, age and types of informal learning experiences? What 
are the experiential differences between males and females among urban, suburban, and rural 
settings? How does the structure and use of science knowledge differ among students from 
contrasting informal learning environments? How are attitudes toward science related to students’ 
informal learning experiences? How do socio-cultural differences among students affect informal 
learning experiences? What is the relationship between cognitive development and informal 
learning environment? These questions provide examples of the applicability of the ILA to various 
problem statements or hypotheses in science education research. 

Informal learning experiences have been identified as influential in a wide variety of science 
education research. The great amount of time students are engaged in experiences outside the 
formal classroom presents a tremendous learning potential. However, students’ informal learning 
environments are under-studied. The ILA could provide science education researchers a means of 
furthering our understandings of knowledge formation, cognitive development and the affective 
influences of the informal activities of children.

COLLABORATION IN THE CLASSROOM: 

A FRAMEWORK FOR RESEARCH AND PRACTICE 

Barbara A. Crawford, Oregon State University 



Introduction 



The current reforms present the dual challenge of designing inquiry-driven instruction and 
creating communities of learners in science classrooms (AA AS, 1993; NRC, 1996). An 
important goal of innovative instruction is to foster in-depth understandings of science content 
and processes; a goal shared by most practicing teachers. Learning communities offer potential 
academic and social opportunities for students to debate ideas, distribute knowledge, and gain 
social responsibility (Brown, Collins, & Duguid, 1989; Lave & Wenger, 1991; Rogoff, 1990). 
The idea of a learning community has gained attention as a desirable environment that could 
engage students in solving problems in collaboration with peers. Yet the reform documents fail 
to provide clear descriptions of how a teacher can create a community of learners. 

The development of a learning environment supporting inquiry is one of the charges made to 
science teachers of all levels. Teaching Standard E of the National Science Education Standards 
states that "Teachers of science develop communities of science learners that reflect the 
intellectual rigor of scientific inquiry and the attitudes and social values conducive to science 
learning" (NRC, 1996). Although a few examples of actual teaching scenarios are included in 
this document, more detailed explanations of how a classroom teacher might design this kind of 
environment appears critical to successful implementation. 

Research has shown that this kind of instruction is rare in today's classrooms (Gallagher, 
1989), difficult to carry out, and requires teachers and students to take on new roles and 
responsibilities (Rogoff, 1994). Facilitating a community of learners involves the teacher 
transforming his or her role from being the main authority of knowledge to that of empowering 
students. This transformation of roles can be problematic for teachers and for students. The 
sharing of the teaching and learning is contradictory to traditional teacher and student roles in K- 




ERiC

12 classrooms. Key to creating a community of learners is the clarification and articulation of 
the roles of teacher and students. 

There are some examples in the literature of learning communities in mathematics 
classrooms (e.g. Ball, 1990; Lampert, 1990; Wilcox et al., 1991 ; Wood et al., 1991) in which 
students and teachers collaborate to develop in-depth understandings of mathematical concepts. 
However, there appear few examples of these kinds of collaborative environments in science 
classrooms. ! 

Goals of the Research 

In studying my own teaching I explored the interactions of my 8th grade physical science 
students and me to determine important aspects of classroom work that correspond to a 
community of learners. The goals of this study are first to identify the critical components of a 
science classroom community of learners, and second to develop a working model for practicing 
teachers and researchers that engages students and teacher in real-world, collaborative science 
learning. 



The Researcher 

As a teacher with 18 years of public school teaching experience, I am concerned with 
translating research findings from scholarly literature into usable guidelines for the classroom 
teacher. Educational jargon and words written inside the ivory tower often remain inaccessible 
to classroom teachers. Research findings often fail to relate to day to day lessons, remaining 
obscure to practitioners. This report focuses on the analytical framework for a study that 
involved designing an inquiry-based course of instruction for my middle school students, 
teaching this course of instruction, and analyzing the collaborative student-student and student- 
teacher interactions (Crawford, 1996). By looking carefully at the analytical framework, I 
reflected on what happened in my science classroom, and in other classrooms I have researched. 
Having formal education in biology, chemistry and microbiology, and professional experience in 



scientific research and development, I am admittedly passionate about engaging students in long 
term investigations (Dewey, 1938). My beliefs of teaching and learning stem from social - 
constructivist perspectives (Lave & Wenger, 1991; Rogoff, 1990,1994; Vygotsky, 1978). This 
view of learning envisions knowledge construction as a process facilitated by discourse and 
social interactions (Brown et al, 1989; Newman et al., 1989). In this social constructivist view 
of learning, scientific knowledge is socially constructed, validated, and communicated. 



Only a brief description of the instructional design will be included in this report. (See 
Crawford, 1996). The instruction was designed to promote in-depth understandings of science 
processes and content through solving meaningful problems (Blumenfeld et al., 1991; Brown et 
al., 1989). Using this project-based approach, I designed a course of instruction that focused 
students on investigating hazardous substances in their lives. This project-based instruction 
featured a driving question. Are There Poisons In Our Lives?, that linked concepts of matter and 
changes in matter to the lives of the student and teacher. (See Krajcik et al., 1994, for features of 
project-based science instruction and characteristics of the driving question.) The design of this 
inquiry-centered instruction was based on the premise that students learn through projects (e.g. 
Dewey, 1938; Krajcik et al., 1994; Tinker, 1991). Although originally planned for eight weeks, 
the poisons project extended over a period of twelve weeks. 



Videotapes of lessons captured classroom interactions during the inquiry-based course of 
instruction. My physical science class consisted of 26 eighth grade students of diverse ethnic 
and economic backgrounds that I taught in the 1993-1994 academic year. The description of the 
particular class, school, community, and focus group of students appears in another report 
(Crawford, 1996). In order to determine which elements of a community of learners emerged in 
this classroom, a framework developed from the literature was used to focus the analysis. This 
framework for analyzing the interactions that occurred in my classroom emerged from three

areas: constructivist views of learning; authentic instruction; and collaborative learning. A 
search for studies involving students engaged in a combination of inquiry and collaboration 
revealed six components of a community of learners: 1) instruction is situated in authentic tasks', 
2) students develop interdependency in small group work; 3) students and teacher debate ideas 
and negotiate understanding ; 4) students and teacher publicly share ideas with members of the 
classroom community; 5) students collaborate with experts outside the classroom; and 6) 
responsibility for learning and teaching is shared. (See Table 1.) Situating instruction in 
authentic tasks involves creating environments similar to those of practitioners (Resnick, 1987). 
In the case of the science classroom, authentic instruction engages students in pursuing answers 
to significant questions similar to activities of professional scientists (Brown et al., 1989). 
Solving problems and doing "real" science in the classroom stems from Dewey (1938) who 
believed that the school community is a place where a child gains authentic experiences by doing 
projects versus solving isolated problems. The importance of having group members acquire 
interdependency is addressed by Cohen (1986). Although group members may struggle at 
times, teachers should delegate authority to group members to communicate and depend on each 
other. Group learning is often equated with cooperative learning (Johnson & Johnson, 1991; 
Slavin, 1981) involving rules used by teachers for distributing group tasks. In establishing a 
community of learners in a science classroom all participants in the classroom collaborate in a 
social context, negotiating meanings and distributing expertise while solving authentic problems. 
Studies of classrooms in which students engage in collaborative interactions depict teachers as 
co-collaborators in developing in-depth understandings of important concepts (Linn & Burbules, 
1993 ; Wood, Cobb, & Yackel, 1992). Smith (1991) describes a model of a learning community 
where students develop scientific understandings collectively. In this learning environment 
students make public their understandings in order to explore their ideas and modify these 
understandings towards a more scientific point of view. Opportunities to collaborate with 
experts may come from personal connections with people in the local community or from

teachers extending the walls of their classrooms using telecommunications (Roup, Gal, Drayton, 
& Pfister, Eds., 1993). Sharing responsibility for learning and teaching involves a 




412 




transformation of participation in which the roles of the members in the classroom change with 
the change in sociocultural activities (Newman et al., 1989; Rogoff, 1994). 

These six components do not necessarily reflect the original intent of the authors of each of 
the studies or position papers. Instead these six components emerged from careful consideration 
of numerous articles on collaboration in classrooms written by cognitive psychologists and 
educational researchers from a variety of disciplines. This framework served to organize the data 
in the study of my teaching and to identify patterns that developed during instruction (Yin, 

1989). For each of the six components, a range of characteristics from traditional to intermediate 
to constructivist determined characteristics in the classroom. The continua used to analyze the 
nature of the interactions is shown in Tables 2-7. 

The analysis of the videotaped lessons consisted of a three part process involving data 
reduction, data display, and conclusion drawing and verification (Miles & Huberman, 1994). 
Narrative summaries of the video-taped lessons were first written. These summaries were then 
critically analyzed for components of a community of learners using the framework. Following 
the writing of the summaries and identification of important sections relating to the components, 
attention was drawn to finding patterns that emerged across the lessons. This review of the 
videotapes produced documents that contained lesson descriptions, segment summaries, 
commentary, and hypotheses. Two other researchers collaborated on the process of data 
reduction and analysis used in interpreting the videotapes that contributed to final emergence of 
themes and tentative conclusions.

Results 



The intent of this report is to suggest critical components of a science classroom community 
of learners. Equally important is the elaboration of these components for use by classroom 
teachers and researchers. The results of systematically analyzing the interactions of my students 
using the components of a community of learners continua revealed eight themes. These themes 
are reported in a separate paper (Crawford, Krajcik, & Marx, in review), and they relate to 
increased student interactions when tasks were student-initiated, connected to real-world 
questions, and relevant to students' experiences. 

The results of the study revealed that students did not operate smoothly in the beginning 
weeks of the instruction. The students focused on carrying out procedures detailed in lab 
activities, but failed to engage in thoughtful conversations about the meanings of the science 
concepts and processes. After introduction of the driving question. Are There Poisons in our 
Lives? students became increasingly engaged in finding answers to their own questions relating 
to this overarching one. Clarification of my expectations of the students also appeared to 
increase the positive interactions and the productivity of the students. One key component that 
appeared particularly influential in increasing collaboration was the connection of students to 
experts outside the classroom. The second key component involved structuring the nature of the 
tasks; those tasks that related to real-world questions engaged the students in wrestling with 
important concepts. Vignettes from video-taped lesson segments are included to illustrate the 
components of a community of learners framework. 

Overview of the Instruction 

During the first two weeks of instruction, several hands-on activities and video laser-disc 
programs provided opportunities to discuss basic properties of matter and changes in matter. For 
example, students investigated the properties of a mixture of cornstarch and water, and debated 
the nature of the strange acting substance: was it a liquid or solid? Format for instruction varied 
from large group discussions to small group activities. The small collaborative groups of three to 



ERIC 



417 




four students were purposely constructed to ensure heterogeneity of academic and social 
characteristics. Students worked in these groups throughout the twelve week course of 
instruction. After two weeks, an unexpected event coincided with the introduction of the overall 
driving question of the instruction: a chemical tanker overturned on the highway near the school 
causing immediate concern. Students initiated thoughtful discussions centering on the possible 
hazards of the spill and questioned policies of the local community. 

Following this event, students brainstormed possible chemicals to investigate. Working in 
their teams, students selected a potential poison, and designed an experiment to explore the 
potential hazard of this chemical on humans. At this point, several of the teams of students 
struggled in designing their investigation and in simply working together as a team. Plenary 
sessions during which teams reported to the class their preliminary ideas for an investigation 
resulted in helpful feedback from peers and the teacher. Key to focusing the students and 
moving them towards setting up and completing their investigations was a teacher handout 
carefully outlining the descriptions and due dates of intermediary products in the study. 
Connection with experts using telecommunications and local people in the community 
heightened the students' productivity and interest in their study. During the final weeks of the 
instruction, each of the seven teams of students sustained increased levels of productivity as they 
focused on their conclusions, and worked on group presentations of their findings. Interviews of 
students verified the change toward a more collaborative environment as the students worked on 
investigations of their own design. 

Situating Instruction in Authentic Tasks 

In a science classroom authentic tasks simulate the kinds of activities in which scientists 
would engage. When tasks relate to real-world contexts, students develop understanding of 
science concepts by restructuring their current knowledge. During the second week of the 
instruction I brought in several containers from my home containing common household 
substances including cleaning agents, foods such as vinegar, drinking water, green colored water.

and air. In this lesson I held up the various bottles, and asked the students to classify them as 

chemical or non-chemical. I asked the class in general. What is a chemical? 

Sally: We don't know. 

I: What is a chemical? Who knows? 

Nathan: A liquid. 

Tammy: Anything really. 

Sarah: Something that you can mix to make something new. 

Bobby: I don't know. Like a substance that can be changed by 

other substances. 

As I held up each substance, I asked if it were a chemical. Students indicated mixed 

! 

responses by raising their hands. When I held up the flask containing the green colored water, 
one boy initiated a response, and said it reminded him of toilet bowl cleaner. He then wondered 
about the purpose of the green color. Other than the question about the green color in the toilet 
bowl cleaner, the task elicited limited student interactions with me or other students in the class. 
As I held up the containers, the students appeared interested in looking at the various stuff. Even 
though students were unsure if the substance were chemical or not, they initiated few questions 
about the nature of the substances. The task involved looking at substances common to the 
everyday life of a middle school student. Yet, the task was largely teacher-directed and tied to 
the scientific definition of matter. The nature of the task was coded as intermediate between 
traditional and constructivist using the continuum below:

Interdependency in Small Group Work 

In a community of learners students working interdependently would begin looking towards 
members of the group for direction instead of solely to the teacher. Students working in 
interdependent groups depend on each other to achieve cognitive goals, and become self- 
directed. Eight weeks after the beginning of the instruction, the team studying vitamins finalized

the design of their team investigation. One of the girls in the four member team had brought in a 
large bag of vitamins that her dad took each day. The members of the team exchanged ideas 
about how to set up an experiment, and after many days settled on applying various amounts of 
the crushed vitamins to different plants. One of the girls brought in over 30 vegetable plants of 
four varieties. Eventually the team members asked to use a section of the school greenhouse that 
they corded off with masking tape marked with large red letters. The two girls set up a schedule 
for the team members to take growth measurements during lunch time and after school, and 
designed the log for recording the data. One of the boys brought in his camera to take pictures of 
the terminal leaves of the tomato plants, to address the problem the team members had in 
determining changes in growth. At this point the interactions of the group members would be 
labeled constructivist according to the continuum below:

students look to group members and bases in their homes. They 
instead of mainly to the teacher for independently decide among 
ideas themselves which household 

substances to test, how to design 
the investigation, and how to carry 
it out 

Negotiation of understandings 

In a community of learners students negotiate understandings by debating their ideas of 
science content and real-world issues with others in the classroom. The dialogue is characterized 
by an active participation by the members of the group. Dialogue that fosters collaborative 
interactions would involve teacher and students exchanging ideas about the meaning of the 
science concepts versus focusing on the exact words used in the textbook definition. During the 
third week of the instruction, I involved my students in a parts per million lab activity. Although 
all the students appeared highly engaged in the activity, they had limited collaborative discourse. 
The students carefully used droppers to measure out solution into the wells of plastic trays. The 
students were so focused on the procedures of the activity, that the discussion never moved from 




420 



lower level talk to negotiating the concepts illustrated by the lab: concentration and context. 

The team discourse fell short of my objective to have the students cognitively engaged in 
debating important science concepts. During this segment of the instruction, the students worked 
intently on completing the activity. However, the negotiation of ideas would be labeled 
traditional. 



What is the nature of the dialogue? 

Environment Characterization Example 

Traditional Students do not ask unsolicited Students discuss the correct 

questions; teacher tells students procedure for using pH paper and 

his/her interpretations; dialog how to label the cups in testing the 

related to procedures of the task/lab acidity of some solutions; students 
activity; students appear passive concerned mainly with completing 
during the lesson the task 



Public Sharing of Ideas 

Public sharing of ideas refers to whole class discussions of science concepts and issues 
initiated by the teacher or the students. This more structured setting contrasts with the informal 
conversations that may occur during small group work at team tables. In scientific communities 
examples of public sharing include project meetings during which members give preliminary 
results of experiments. Late in the second week of instruction, a public sharing session involved 
the students in debating important issues and relating these issues to science concepts. An 
accident had occurred on a highway exit ramp near the school: a chemical tanker had 
overturned, spilling some of the contents. The event caused a school bus to become trapped in a 
traffic jam along with parents returning home from work and bringing students home from 
school. The next day several students ran into class, asking me to talk about the spill in class. In 
discussing the spill, the students recounted the accident and evaluated the potential hazard on the 
community. The students actively engaged in reconstructing the series of events and attempted 
to assess the impact of these events on the environment. As soon as one student finished talking, 
another would offer information. This engagement contrasted sharply with the passive response 




421 



of the students in a previous class discussion on chemical and physical changes. During this 
lesson, the nature of public sharing would be labeled constructivist according to the continuum 
below: 



What is the nature of the reporting of ideas? 

Environment Characterization Example 

Constructivist Students share their own ideas Students publicly share ideas of 
publicly with other members of the setting up an investigation of the 
class for feedback and revision effect of asbestos on plant growth; 

other students in the class question 
the experimental design, and 
suggest a better, and safer means of 
setting up the investigation 



Collaboration With Experts 

In traditional classrooms the main sources of information are the textbook and the teacher. 

In a community of learners, members extend the boundaries of the classroom by including 
resource people outside the classroom walls. Students collaborating with experts in a 
constructivist manner would seek help and information through personal contacts, and even share 
their own findings with experts. Beginning in weeks 5-7 of the instruction, 1 helped my students 
access an electronic (E-mail) bulletin board called LabNet, an area on the commercial network, 
America On-Line. This bulletin board, developed by the Technical Education Research Center, 
is staffed by scientists and science educators and is used by teachers of other project-based 
classrooms (Roup et al., 1993). All the teams posted inquiries of their poisons, and used the E- 
mail responses to add their knowledge base of their poison, or to refine their experiments. One 
of the E-mail responses received by the team studying smoking and tobacco caused such a 
reaction that the team members pleaded with me to share the content of the message with the 
class. The contents of the message included reference to a recent newspaper article that stated 
that under mounting pressure from critics, the tobacco industry released a list of 599 chemicals 
added to cigarettes, including such additives as insecticide, methoprene, and ammonia. One of 
the members of the team read the E-mail message to the class, and asked for their classmates'

responses. During this lesson, the nature of collaborating with experts would be labeled 
intermediate according to the continuum below:

Shared Responsibility for Learning and Teaching 

Shared responsibility for learning and teaching involves students taking responsibility for 
their own learning. In a community of learners the teacher and students collaborate, generating 
interpretation by working together. In some cases, the student may take on the role of the 
teacher, either in small group or large group settings. In traditional classrooms, the authority 
remains with the teacher, and this interchange of roles relating to teaching and learning rarely 
happens. Beginning in week 5-7, Bobby became interested in the use of telecommunications. 
Peter, another boy in the class, asked Bobby to teach him how to access the bulletin board. 
Bobby and Peter began asking to come to the classroom during lunch instead of the cafeteria. 
Once they figured out how to upload the team letters, they taught me. Throughout the reminder 
of the instructional period, Bobby served as telecommunications expert and main uploader and 
downloader of E-mail for the teams in his class. Bobby would either distribute messages or 
would facilitate other team members in accessing them. Sometimes Peter would share this 
responsibility. Peter and Bobby shared in each team's enthusiasm when receiving mail, and they 
continued to come to the classroom during lunch, often bringing students from other classes. 
During these events of accessing and distributing messages, the nature of sharing responsibility 
for learning and teaching would be labeled constructivist according to the continuum below:

Discussion and Implications for Research and Teaching 

The focus of national reforms on inquiry and collaboration necessitates careful study of the 
processes involved in creating these kinds of learning environments. 

The implications of examining student and teacher interactions and looking critically at the new 
roles of teachers and students in a community of learners could inform researchers and teachers 
in how to create these kinds of learning environments. 

I used a process of researching the literature and action research to explore the critical 
components of a community of learners in my middle school science classroom. 

The systematic application of the constructed rubrics of the collaborative components served to 
highlight events during my instruction that influenced students in actively engaging in 
substantive interactions. The two components in the framework that appeared critical in moving 
my classroom towards a community of learners were first, the authenticity of the tasks, and 
second, the connection with experts outside the classroom. When the lab activities were 
connected to topics rather than to the student-generated investigations, the student interactions 
consisted of following procedures rather than negotiating understandings of important concepts. 
However, when activities were situated in real-world contexts, the students engaged in 
collaborative interactions. When students connected to experts outside the classroom, students 
increased the thoughtfulness of their conversations and sharing of ideas. Using the rubrics also 
revealed segments of lessons that did not exemplify a community of learners ; instruction that 
was teacher-centered versus student-centered and topic-driven rather than inquiry-driven. 




424 44 7 



Creating a community of learners in my science classroom did not occur smoothly. This 
kind of teaching, in which students are given the freedom to make choices in designing 
investigations and to grapple with ideas by debating with peers, is difficult Teaching is 
complex; classrooms are complex. Therefore by isolating important features of a learning 
community and providing vignettes of classroom events to illustrate these components, teachers 
and researchers may be able to critically determine the extent to which a classroom resembles a 
community of learners fostering inquiry. This community depends on the teacher and students 
taking on roles that contribute to the negotiation of understanding of the science content, and to 
finding answers to the questions generated by this community. The roles of the teacher and 
students a re critical to creating and maintaining a community . "The idea of a community of 
learners is based on the premise that learning occurs as people participate in shared endeavors 
with others, with all playing active but often asymmetrical roles in sociocultural activity" 
(Rogoff, 1994, p.209).

DEVELOPING AND ACTING UPON ONE’S CONCEPTION OF 
SCIENCE: THE REALITY OF TEACHER PREPARATION 



Randy Bell, Oregon State University 
Norman G. Lederman, Oregon State University 
Fouad Abd-El-Khalick, Oregon State University 

Introduction 

Recent reforms in science education have placed increased emphasis on helping students 
develop an understanding of global, integrating themes (eg., equilibrium, evolution, and systems) 
as opposed to placing primary emphasis on developing specific factual knowledge (AAAS, 1993; 
NRC, 1996). Although the specific recommendations of each of these reform efforts differ to 
some degree, emphasis on developing students’ understanding of the nature of science (NOS) is 
clearly a common theme This should not be surprising since this educational outcome has been a 
concern since 1907 (Lederman, 1992). 

Despite the longevity of the concern about students’ understanding of the NOS, progress 
toward the goal remains disappointing. Research has consistently shown that students’ and 
teachers’ views are not consistent with contemporary conceptions of the NOS (Duschl, 1990; 
Lederman, 1992, among others). Recent research has focused on teachers’ conceptions of the 
NOS and avenues to help them develop desired understandings (Aguirere, Haggerty, & Linder, 
1990; Brickhouse, 1989, 1990; Brickhouse & Bodner, 1992; Bloom, 1989; Briscoe, 1991; 
Gallagher, 1991; King, 1991; Koulaidis & Ogbom, 1989). This line of research is based on the 
assumption that teachers’ conceptions directly translate into their teaching practices. This 
assumption, while intuitive, has not been validated (Lederman & Druger, 1985; Lederman & 
Zeidler, 1987). 




429 



452 



In fact, a growing body of research indicates that the relationship between teachers’ 
conceptions and their classroom practices is far from being direct or simple. For instance, Gess- 
Newsome and Lederman (1995) found that the translation of experienced high school teachers’ 
conceptions of their subject matter into their teaching could be direct, limited by other variables, 
or absent. The authors identified six variables that seemed to mediate such translation, including 
teacher intentions, content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, students’ needs, teacher 
autonomy, and time. Additionally, Smith and Neale (1989) reported that elementary science 
teachers’ content knowledge, as well as their concerns with classroom management and 
organization, were significant factors in translating their beliefs about science into classroom 
practices. 

Similar results are evident in research focused on the translation of teachers’ conceptions of 
the NOS into classroom practice. In general, these studies have indicated that the relationship 
between teachers’ beliefs about the NOS and their classroom practice is more complex than 
originally imagined. Several constraining factors have been reported, including pressure to cover 
content (Duschl & Wright, 1989; Hodson, 1993), classroom management and organizational 
principles (Hodson, 1993; Lantz & Kass, 1987; Lederman, 1995), concerns for student abilities 
and motivation (Brickhouse & Bodner, 1992; Duschl & Wright, 1989; Lederman, 1995), 
institutional constraints (Brickhouse & Bodner, 1992) and teaching experience (Brickhouse & 
Bodner, 1992; Lederman, 1995). Thus, the results of these studies are consistent with Lederman 
and Zeidler’s (1987) conclusion that “a teacher’s classroom behavior does not necessarily vary as 
a direct result of his/her conceptions [about the NOS .]’’ (p. 731).

Given the apparent complexity of the relationship between teachers’ conceptions and their 
teaching practices, it should prove fruitful to explore preservice teachers’ conceptions of the NOS 
and their translation into classroom practice. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the 
relationship of preservice teachers’ conceptions of the NOS with their planning and student- 
teaching. The main questions of the investigation were: 

1 . What are preservice science teachers’ conceptions of the NOS prior to student-teaching? 

2. Do preservice teachers emphasize the NOS in their planning and/or teaching? 

3. What are the factors that explain preservice teachers’ emphasis on the NOS in their 
teaching? 



Method 

Sample 

Fourteen preservice science teachers, nine male and five female, participated in the study. 
Participants were enrolled in a fifth-year MAT teacher preparation program in a rural state university 
and were seeking certification in secondary level science. All participants had earned BS degrees and 
seven had earned MS degrees in their disciplines prior to joining the program. During the year of 
teacher preparation the preservice teachers were involved in several campus-based university classes 
that directly related to science teaching (e g.. Secondary Science Methods and Strategies, 
Microteaching, Curriculum, Science Pedagogy), and student-teaching. It is noteworthy that the 
program places emphasis on the NOS, its central role in the reform efforts, and its implications for 
teaching science in the classroom. 

Procedures 

Data collection was continuous and spanned the entire calendar year that the participants were 
enrolled in the program. Several data sources were used to answer the questions of interest. 
Following the summer coursework in science methods, but prior to student-teaching internships, the 
preservice teachers were administered a questionnaire to assess their conceptions of the NOS. This 



O 



431 



questionnaire consisted of seven open-ended items and was intended to be used in conjunction with 
follow-up interviews (Lederman & O’Mally, 1990). The aspects of the NOS assessed were: the 
tentative and empirical nature of science, subjectivity, creativity, and the role of social and cultural 
contexts in science, observation versus inference, and the functions and relationships of theories and 
laws. The questionnaires were not analyzed until the end of the data collection process to avoid 
biasing other phases of data collection and/or analysis. 

The researchers collected copies of all participants’ daily lesson plans for the 12 week student- 
teaching, as well as classroom videotapes, and supervisors’ clinical observation notes. Each 
participant’s portfolio, a requirement for the completion of the MAT program, was also used as a 
data source. Portfolios consisted of two full units (12 to 16 days each) of instruction, including 
rationales, goals, objectives, lesson plans, assessment instruments, reflections on the success of 
individual lessons and the unit as a whole, and videotapes of classroom instruction. These data were 
searched for evidence that the preservice teachers planned for and/or taught the aforementioned 
aspects of the NOS during their student-teaching. The specific instances, whether explicit or implicit, 
in which participants addressed the NOS in their planning were documented. Instructional objectives, 
and/or activities that overtly addressed one or more aspects of the NOS were taken to be explicit 
instances. Implicit instances, on the other hand, represented references to aspects of the NOS 
inferred from less prominent parts of the lesson plans such as isolated statements inserted into an 
instructional sequence. Activities that were consistent with a particular view of science, but did not 
explicitly focus students’ attention on the NOS were also considered to be implicit instances. 

Data Analysis 

Prior to data analysis, the researchers independently analyzed three identical, randomly selected 
samples of each of the data sources. Results of these analyses were compared in order to establish 
inter-rater agreement on the aforementioned system for identifying instances of the NOS. Better than 
90% agreement among the three researchers was achieved for explicit references to the NOS. 
Identified instances of implicit references to the NOS were compared and discussed, but due to the 
subjective nature of the interpretation of these references, the researchers decided to focus subsequent 

ERIC 



432 

455 



analysis primarily on the explicit references to the NOS. Finally, the remaining collected documents 
and videotapes were distributed among the three researchers and analyzed for explicit references to 
the NOS. 

Following the analysis of portfolio and instructional materials data, preservice teachers were 
interviewed during their final term (following student-teaching) of the MAT program. These semi- 
structured interviews were conducted to validate responses to the NOS questionnaire and generate in- 
depth profiles of the participants’ views. The interviews were also used to verify and corroborate the 
previous analysis of the other data sources. A core set of questions guided the interviews. 

1 . What do you think are the most important things to emphasize in your teaching? Why? 

2. What in your opinion is the NOS? What makes science different from other disciplines of 
inquiry (religion, philosophy, etc.)? 

3 . (At this point interviewees were provided with their questionnaires, asked to familiarize 
themselves with their earlier responses, and to comment on and clarify these responses.) 
What did you mean by your response to question number (1-7)? 

4. Do you think that teaching the NOS is important? Why? (or Why not?) 

5. Did you teach the NOS? If yes, how? Why did you teach the NOS in that particular way? 
(If not, why?) 

6. Did you do enough? Can you elaborate? 

7. Did your students learn the NOS? How do you know? Did you assess your students’ 
understanding of the NOS? How did you do that? 

8. (The participants were then provided with evidence from the analysis of their lesson plans, 
work samples, and videotapes and asked to comment on any discrepancies between what 
they said they did and what was in their plans and portfolios.) On reviewing your lesson 
plans, I observed that you did not (or did) do much with the NOS. Why? 

9. I did not (or did) observe that you assessed understanding of the NOS? WTiy? (or Why 
did you assess understanding of the NOS in that particular way?) 

10. How will you deal with the NOS when you have your own class?

The typical duration of an interview was one hour. Digressions were common, and the participants’ 
lines of thought were followed and probed in depth. All interviews were audiotaped and transcribed 
for analysis. 

Results 

Conceptions of the Nature of Science 

Analysis of responses to the open-ended questionnaire, as validated in the interviews, indicated 
that participants’ views of the NOS were, in general, consistent with contemporary conceptions of the 
scientific enterprise. Most of the preservice teachers demonstrated adequate understandings of the 
empirical and tentative nature of science, and the role of subjectivity and creativity in science. 
However, their understandings of the relationship between theories and laws, and the distinction 
between observation and inference, even though discernible, were not well articulated. Moreover, 
participants failed to explicate a role for social and cultural factors in the construction of scientific 
knowledge and often confused the processes of science with aspects of the NOS. These conclusions 
are elucidated and supported with quotations in the paragraphs that follow. 

That science is empirically based was emphasized by all participants In fact, this aspect was 
dubbed essential in differentiating science from other disciplines of inquiry such as religion and 
philosophy. Tentativeness was another aspect of the NOS that was clearly explicated by all student- 
teachers. All categories of scientific knowledge including ‘facts’, hypotheses, theories and laws were 
believed to change: 

Things that at one point were considered to be facts are not now taken to be so Theories do 

change, science is tentative . even laws change. (T # 1)

ERIC 



434 



The tentativeness of science was intimately linked with its empirical nature. In fact, the collection of 
new data and the accumulation of counter evidence were cited as the major reasons for the 
modification of scientific constructs: 

Science is tentative [and] subject to change by virtue of collecting new data. (T # 1) 

The knowledge base of science is always challenged, refined, and changed ... by doing 
empirical observations and experimentation. (T # 14) 

Even complete theories have to be altered to make them more consistent with new 
observations. (T # 7) 

Participants also advanced subjectivity and creativity as factors that contribute to the tentative nature 
of science: 

Tentative means that even though you try to exclude personal bias, you never can completely, 
so results and conclusions are tentative. (T # 5) 

The view that science is a completely objective and rational activity was dismissed by the 
participants. Subjectivity, creativity, and imagination were advanced as integral to scientific 
investigation. Subjectivity, including the individuality of scientists, their backgrounds, and beliefs, 
was thought to play a major role in interpreting data, drawing inferences, and formulating 
conclusions: 

Even though rational and objective inferences are supposed to be drawn from data . . . 
irrational and subjective elements due to human nature are at play . . . different scientists are 
people and have different viewpoints . . . their own preconceived notions and expectations get 
into the interpretation of the data . . imagination is necessary for making inferences out of 
data. (T # 1) 

Science is not purely logical, there are tons of things that come into play . . . and if [a theory or 
hypothesis] is your baby, your life-long work, you don’t want to give it up, it hurts. (T # 4) 



O 

ERIC 



435 



Creativity and imagination were given equal weight in scientific investigations, especially in 
determining research methods: 

There is no one method of doing science. In developing their methods scientists use 
imagination and creativity. (T # 1) 

And even though all participants ascribed a role for creativity and imagination, they differed as to the 
stages at which these factors come into play in scientific investigations. Some thought that “there is 
creativity before and after data collection,” (T # 7) others thought that they “don’t see how you can 
be creative in collecting data. After data collection, sure it is creative. It takes a little imagination to 
determine which route to follow.” (T # 8) Still others believed that “there is a creative aspect to 
science, especially when developing hypotheses ... but when you test a hypothesis, this moves you 
[to using] accepted, logical ways of testing.” (T # 1) 

An understanding of the distinction between observation and inference was not evident in the 
case of many participants. Moreover, even though some of the preservice teachers clearly delineated 
the distinction between scientific theories and laws, many failed to articulate that distinction. That 
laws are statements or descriptions of discernible patterns in observable phenomena and that theories 
are inferred explanations for those phenomena, was not evident to many participants: 

I can’t nail down the difference between theories and laws . . . Laws seem more established and 
this is the only difference I can see. (T # 14) 

Laws are more global, bigger . . . there should be a clear way to distinguish [theories and laws] 
but I can’t think of one (T # 5) 

A few even expressed a simplistic, hierarchical view between these constructs in which theories 
become laws depending on the availability of supporting evidence, thus failing to recognize that 
theories and laws are different kinds of knowledge: 





436 



A law is a supported theory. A theory is a proposed idea or application. (T # 8) 

Finally, the effects of the social and cultural context in which scientific investigations are 

embedded were mostly overlooked and at best poorly articulated by the participants. Moreover, 
some of them confused scientific processes with aspects of the NOS. When asked in the interview 
what they thought the NOS was, some participants gave responses similar to the following: 

Science has a set of processes: observation, experiments, and trying to draw conclusions and 
connections. (T # 3) 

There are two important aspects to science . . . one is the development of a hypothesis .... The 
second is coming up with a way to test the hypothesis. (T # 1) 

In summary, although the 14 participants’ had not mastered all seven aspects of the NOS that the 

MAT program emphasized, they were able to demonstrate adequate understandings of the tentative, 
and empirical aspects of the NOS, as well as the roles of subjectivity and creativity. 

Planning for and Teaching the Nature of Science 

When asked, toward the end of the interviews, whether teaching the NOS is important, all but 
two participants answered in the positive. Several justifications were provided. Many thought that 
teaching the NOS makes learning science more interesting. Others advanced that teaching the NOS is 
imperative because it cannot be separated from the content of science. Others argued that science as 
‘a valuable way of thinking’ can only be conveyed to students by teaching the NOS. Still others 
thought that teaching the NOS is a safeguard against dogmatism, necessary for making decisions 
regarding scientifically related societal issues, or that it reinforces the learning of science process 
skills. 

However, analysis of the participants’ lesson plans showed rare evidence of planning to teach 
the NOS. There were a small number of references to the NOS in a few of the participants’ plans. 




437 



460 



These instances, however, were isolated, lacked focus, and generally addressed a single aspect of the 
NOS. Only two participants had planned lessons that specifically addressed the NOS. One 
participant had two separate lessons that focused on explicating the role of hypotheses and models in 
science and featured the use of a few activities and demonstrations geared toward that end. The other 
participant had planned a single lesson in which he used the same demonstrations initially presented in 
the MAT program to help his students distinguish between scientific observations and inferences. 
However, when asked about this lesson in the interview, he replied: 

That [lesson] is the demos thing. I don’t consider that this is teaching the NOS, but I did it 

anyway ... I don’t believe that this is the best way to do it. (T # 3) 

The apparent dissonance between the importance of teaching the NOS as emphasized by most 
of the participants, and the scarce attention they accorded the NOS in their instructional planning is 
intriguing and worthy of further discussion. It is possible that the participants anticipated the 
researchers’ interest in the NOS. The question of whether it was important to teach the NOS, as 
previously noted, was asked later in the interview. At that stage the participants were already aware 
of the interviewers’ focus, and might have responded accordingly. The plausibility of this explanation 
is increased by the fact that one of the researchers placed explicit emphasis on the NOS and how to 
teach it in two MAT courses in which the participants were enrolled, while another researcher 
supervised many of the participants and often discussed the NOS with them. However, the first 
question on the interview -before the theme of the NOS was brought up, asked the preservice 
teachers to delineate the things they thought were most important to emphasize in their teaching. In 
responding to this question, 1 1 of the 14 preservice teachers did not list the NOS as a topic they 
would emphasize in their teaching. Many other aspects were ascribed more importance. Students’ 
needs and interests figured prominently in what participants’ thought was important to teach 




438 



Participants thought their primary goal would be to secure a safe learning environment that would 
sustain students’ interest in learning science. The aspects advanced as essential included 
combinations of the following: helping students develop generic reasoning skills such as synthesis, 
evaluation, and creative thinking; developing students’ social skills such as communication, 
cooperation, self confidence, and respect for others; developing students’ science process skills and 
their skills in using scientific equipment; teaching science content with less emphasis on factual 
knowledge and increased attention to mechanisms, interrelationships, and applications. The science 
content and applications emphasized were those deemed necessary for making informed scientifically- 
related social decisions and developing job related skills. Thus, when directive questions and cues 
were absent participants --with three exceptions, did not ascribe any importance or priority to 
teaching the NOS in their classrooms. Even the three preservice teachers who thought that teaching 
the NOS was important listed this goal only third or fourth. It seems that the preservice teachers did 
not internalize the importance of teaching the NOS. 

An additional factor that might account for the discrepancy between the participants’ emphasis 
on the importance of teaching the NOS and the scant attention they accorded this aspect in their 
teaching relates to the participants’ views on how to teach the NOS. When asked whether they 
taught the NOS in their student-teaching, 12 out of 14 participants said they did. However, analyses 
of the supervisors’ field notes and the preservice teachers’ videotaped lessons during student-teaching 
revealed that the participants actually addressed the NOS in their teaching much less than they had 
claimed. As it turned out, although the MAT program consistently emphasized that the NOS needed 
to be explicitly addressed, the few cases where participants reported teaching the NOS involved 



O 

ERIC 



439 



482 



instances where students were simply “doing science.” Either the preservice teachers were not really 
emphasizing the NOS, or they believed that students could learn it implicitly. 

It is interesting to note that participants were shown a minimum of eight activities (including 
content embedded activities) in their Science Methods class specifically designed to teach the NOS. 
Yet, despite the program’s emphasis on how to teach the NOS, most of the preservice teachers 
indicated that they needed more activities before they could adequately teach the NOS: 

The NOS wasn’t strongly emphasized . . . because I didn’t have enough resources to do many 
demos of the NOS. (T# 10) 

Moreover, all participants, including the few who claimed to have taught the NOS explicitly, 
were unsure whether their students learned anything about the NOS. None of the 14 participants 
reported formally assessing students’ understanding of the aspects of the NOS that they believed they 
had taught. Again, there appears to be a significant discrepancy between these preservice teachers’ 
stated belief in the importance of teaching the NOS and their failure to formally assess it. 

To sum up, even though questionnaire and interview responses revealed that all participants had 
adequate understandings of several important aspects of the NOS, most gave little attention to 
planning, teaching, and evaluating their students’ understandings of the NOS. Participants’ justified 
this discrepancy between their beliefs and instructional practices during the interviews by appealing to 
several constraining factors. 

Constraints on Teaching the Nature of Science 

Participants viewed the NOS as less significant than other outcomes such as students’ needs and 
attitudes, and science content and processes. Moreover, given their preoccupation with classroom 
management and routine chores, they accorded less attention to teaching the NOS. Second, they 
expressed discomfort with their own understandings of the NOS. Third, they noted the lack of 





440 



resources and experience for teaching and/or assessing understanding of the NOS. Finally, they noted 
the constraints related to the nature of student-teaching especially the restraints placed upon them by 
their cooperating teachers. 

As mentioned earlier, when given freedom, most participants did not give priority to teaching 
the NOS. Students’ needs and interests were important factors in deciding what should be 
emphasized in the classroom as evident in the following representative quotation: 

I think kids are not interested in the NOS itself . . . For me it is important to do with kids 
things that are important to them, that somehow they can buy into it, and you know, say this is 
important and I want to learn this ... I don’t plan to teach the NOS ... I don’t think it is 
something that I would spend a great deal of time on. (T # 14) 

Others thought that teaching content had precedence to teaching the NOS: 

Getting the knowledge base is more important than the NOS. I have to stick to content 
knowledge. (T # 7) 

Many other preservice teachers explained that they are not confident enough in their abilities to 
efficiently manage their classes as beginning teachers, let alone having to worry about teaching the 
NOS: 

When I’m confident enough how to run the classroom environment and all of that, and I feel 
confident in the school environment, and have all other things under control so I don’t have to 
worry about the day to day process of just surviving, I think I will come up with more activities 
to promote the NOS. (T # 7) 

Many participants also expressed their discomfort with their own understandings of the NOS 
and their ability to assess student understanding of a topic to which they were first introduced in their 
MAT program: 




441 



I didn’t do much with [the NOS], maybe due to a lack of my understanding ... I struggled 
enough just to get lesson plans done, I didn’t know how, or how to make it easy enough to 
make it worth my own time. How can I teach it if I don’t quite get it yet . . . it takes a lot of 
processing things that you’re given for the first time. I went through four years of 
undergraduate studies with no NOS, and none in high school either. (T # 8) 

I couldn’t really assess the NOS, because I don’t really know what the NOS at the high school 
level is. (T # 7) 

I was not prepared to teach the NOS. (T # 3) 

The lack of resources and materials was another reason given for not teaching the NOS: 

I did not have enough materials to do many demos of the NOS ... I have a couple of resources 
from journals. (T # 5). 

A final important factor was the nature of student-teaching experience. Participants explained 
that they had to cover the content that their mentor teachers had assigned them within predetermined 
time limits. They felt they were given no choice in deciding what their students should learn: 

No, the NOS was not emphasized because of how things are driven in the school, you have a 
certain amount of things in a certain amount of time ... I had to keep up with my mentor since 
I couldn’t teach radically different stuff. (T # 5) 

I had material that I needed to cover. I had content more in mind that the NOS. I had to 
emphasize content, which is not necessarily how I like to teach it. (T # 1) 

For one, it was not an ideal situation for me to do the NOS the way I wanted to. Student 
teaching is an artificial situation, I don’t have complete freedom to do what I want ... I did not 
have the opportunity to do what I exactly wanted to do . . . you teach what the mentor teacher 
would like for you to teach. (T # 4) 




442

Discussion and Implications 



Consistent with previous research it seems clear that teachers’ conceptions of the NOS do 
not necessarily influence their classroom practice (Brickhouse, 1990; Duschl & Wright, 1989; 
Hodson, 1993; Lederman, 1992; Lederman & Zeidler, 1987). Indeed, this was the case for the 
majority of the 14 participants who all possessed views of the NOS consistent with current 
reforms. 

Teacher preparation, no doubt, has a direct impact on the successful implementation of the 
reform efforts in the science classroom. As far as the NOS is concerned, efforts have focused on 
helping preservice teachers develop adequate understandings of the NOS. The results of this 
study suggest that although understanding the NOS can be thought of as a necessary condition, it 
nevertheless is not sufficient. The crucial translation of preservice teachers’ conceptions of the 
NOS into classroom practices needs to be reinforced by the culture of teacher preparation. To 
start with, teacher preparation programs should help prospective teachers develop an 
understanding of the rationale behind, and a comprehension of the importance of emphasizing the 
NOS in their teaching that goes beyond the customary discourse. Preservice teachers should be 
able to justify for themselves the importance of stressing the NOS, and to derive a framework in 
which the NOS accords with and reinforces other aspects that they believe are worth teaching 
(e g., student attitudes and science content). Second, preservice teachers should be given much 
more extensive experience in teaching and assessing the NOS. Such experiences should be based 
on practical understandings of how students learn and what it takes to modify instructional 
activities to reinforce developing adequate understandings of the NOS. Every effort should be 
taken to insure that student teaching serves to reinforce the above focus, rather than undermine it. 




443 



Third, preservice teachers should have planned opportunities to teach the NOS in their internships 
as opposed to it being left to chance or to the discretion of mentor teachers. Most importantly, it 
should be emphasized that explicit attention to the NOS is essential (Lederman, 1995). Extensive 
effort should be made to help teachers avoid the apparent tendency to think that the NOS can be 
taught implicitly through student participation in science activities.

BARRIERS FOR HISPANICS AND AMERICAN INDIANS 
ENTERING SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS: CULTURAL 
DILEMMAS 

Katherine I. Norman, California State University San Marcos

This paper includes two sections. In the first section, one author discusses the growth of 
the U.S. Hispanic population and the barriers faced by Hispanic students entering science and 
mathematics in our educational system. In the second section, the other author discusses the 
American Indian population and factors which affect the success of American Indians in science. 
Both authors emphasize the role of culture and obstacles faced by K-12 students when their culture 
conflicts with the majority culture. 



Comparing beliefs of teachers and parents provides insight into cultural dilemmas faced by 
minority students in majority schools. Divergent convictions are illustrated with quotes from a 
Texas teacher and a Latino Parent: 

From the teacher “The parents never come to school and they don’t teach respect in the 
home. Why, the children won’t even look me in the eye when I talk to them.” 

From the parent “Respect is the most important thing is what I tell my kids. Don’t make 
trouble, don’t ask questions, and look down when the teacher talks to you.” 

(Hodgkinson & Outtz, 1996). 

Hispanics demonstrate practices similar to many other “non-majority” groups. Showing 
respect for elders and authority figures by looking at the floor and being silent when in the 
presence of teachers is taught as proper etiquette by many minorities, and yet is considered a sign 
of disrespect by traditional white America. 

Other differences in the cultural values of Hispanics and “mainstream” America include the 
practice of “putting yourself forward.” This is considered a step toward excellence by many

Barriers for Hispanics Entering Science and Mathematics

Americans, but is not taught or even considered by Hispanics. Many of the differences and 
conflicting values end up being barriers for Hispanics, and prevent them from succeeding in their 
educational and career endeavors. The recent increase in the U.S. Hispanic population and barriers 
which prevent the Hispanic population from succeeding in science and mathematics are discussed 
in this section of the paper. 

Hispanics in the U.S. 

The U.S. Bureau of the Census lists four racial categories (American Indian/Alaskan 
Native, Asian/Pacific Islander, Black and White), and only one ethnic group which is Hispanic. 
The Hispanic ethnic category exists only in this country. The term “Hispanic “ was coined as a 
catch-all category to cover many national and regional groups. Hispanics may be of any race and 
are divided by geography, country of origin, class, group differences, and the time and 
circumstance of their entry into this country. “Hispanic” is the term normally used in the Eastern 
part of the U.S. “Latino” or “Chicano” is the preferred term in California, and “La Raza” is 
preferred by some and means from Mexico and Central America (Hodgkinson & Outtz, 1996). 

Hispanics usually think of themselves in relation to the county from which their ancestors 
came. The largest Hispanic groups in the U.S. are Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, Cuban 
Americans, and Central and South Americans. The U. S. Hispanic population is increasing 
rapidly, with Texas and California leading the nation in percentages of Hispanics. Between 1980 
and 1990, the Hispanic population grew seven times as fast as the rest of the U.S. population, 
increasing by 53%. By the year 2010, the U.S. Hispanic population is expected to number 39.3 
million, compared to the expected African American population of 40.4 million. By 2015, 
Hispanics are expected to outnumber African Americans 44 million to 43.1 million. The increase in 
the Hispanic population is due to several factors: a high birth rate (26/1000 women in 1993), 
substantial immigration over the past several decades, and the tendency of Hispanic females to 
marry and have children early. 




ERIC 



449 



There are approximately 800,000 migrant farm workers in the U.S., 94% of whom are 
Hispanic and 80% of whom were bom in Mexico. These Hispanics have the lowest graduate rate 
of any population in the U.S.; many leave school after the sixth grade. They spend little time 
discussing positive educational experiences with their children, primarily because they have had 
few such experiences. The life expectancy of a migrant worker is 49, compared to 75 for other 
citizens. Repeating cycles of ignorance, lack of self-respect, menial job skills, poor medical care, 
poverty and early pregnancies dominate migrant communities (Hodgkinson & Outtz, 1996). 

The Hispanic Educational Pipeline 

The educational pipeline for Hispanics is partially closed at the bottom where the youngest 
children enter, due to immigration, low family income, lack of parent education, limited English 
and job skills. Forty percent of Hispanics leave school before the spring of their sophomore year, 
and 56% of Hispanic adults are functionally illiterate. In 1989, only 16% of 18-24 year old 
Hispanic Americans were enrolled in college, and they continue to be vastly underrepresented in 
graduate programs. States with the highest drop-out rates for Hispanics include New York (62%), 
Texas (45%), and Illinois (47%) (Schuhmann, 1992). 

Barriers for Hispanics to Science and Mathematics Studies and Careers 

Barriers for Hispanics entering science and math are the same factors that cause their 
attrition from formal schooling. Many of these barriers can be traced to differences in their culture 
and in the majority American culture, and include (a) alienation of parents in the education process; 
(b) language; (c) income disparity and poverty (d) failure of the system to identify students in 
danger of dropping out; and (e) a shortage of role models in education as well as in the sciences 
and mathematics (Schuhmann, 1992). 

Hispanics are divergent thinkers, yet many of our educational practices (particularly 
traditional assessments) call for convergent thinking. The learning preferences of Hispanics have 
been ignored, and Hispanics have been expected to “fit in” with the majority. Hispanics have had 





450 



to fight unspoken values, and many Hispanic students have faced negative preconceived 
expectations from society and teachers. With an increase in immigration, the need for bilingual 
instruction has increased while funding for bilingual education has decreased. 

Absence of Science and Math Encouragement and Opportunities 

The author conducted a pilot study in a Southern California high school, inquiring about 
Hispanic students’ personal beliefs and family values related to success in science and mathematics 
studies and careers. Results indicated that ninth and tenth grade Hispanic students have received 
limited encouragement from family members and teachers to pursue careers in science and math. 
Hispanic students were asked why their peers do not enter science and math programs. Their 
answers included the following: 

“Parents discourage them.” 

“Students discourage them.” 

‘Teachers discourage them.” 

“Low self-esteem” 

“Background” 

“Some people don’t like math or science because they get bad grades.” 

“Program evaluators base their opinions only on grades instead of the actual persons 
potential.” 

“Some kids don’t even think about it so they don’t even care. Some kids don’t know when 
programs are up. Some don’t even care.” 

“Their lack of interest and that they’re lazy.” 

“Work” 

“Intimidation of not knowing all the material” 

“Laziness, wrong teachers, no motivation.” 

“People find it difficulty, boring. Financial trouble.” 

“It’s the money.” 




451 



Recommendations for the Education of Hispanic Students 



With all of the discouragement cited in the pilot study, the opportunity for Hispanics to 
enter science and math clearly seems restricted. Teacher education and parental education is 
necessary to provide opportunities for K-12 students to enter science and math programs. Other 
requirements for strong educational programs for Hispanics range from training in study skills to 
financial incentives and financial aid. Most importantly, students must be provided an environment 
that assures them they can succeed as scientists, mathematicians, and science/math educators. 
Mentors and role models are essential. 

Other necessities include K-college linkages, family involvement, a curriculum that reflects 
the student’s culture, and assessment practices which reveal what students know. Linkages should 
be established in elementary, middle and high schools, as well as in two and four year colleges. 
Families should be involved in the educational process: parents must be personally invited to 
participate in school activities. The curriculum should reflect students’ languages, as well as their 
cultural backgrounds and experiences. Alternative assessment measures should be created to 
determine aptitude and success in educational programs. 

Teachers need to develop and demonstrate an understanding of individual and group 
differences in learning styles and working habits. They should incorporate cultural elements into 
their teaching and pay attention to nonverbal communication, values, and communication patterns. 
Classroom management strategies must consider cultural, socioeconomic and linguistic factors. 
Instructional activities should be organized to build on ways in which students participate in 
discourse in their own cultures. Educators must recognize and honor the values and norms of the 
students’ home cultures, and should recognize the legitimacy of and use the language of the 
students. Teachers and college faculty must be prepared to work with diverse students. Finally, 
students who can bring cultural understanding and sensitivities to teaching must be recruited into 
teacher preparation programs (Schuhmann, 1992). Only when our educational systems and 




452 



475 



programs provide for the strengths and needs of Hispanic students will these students succeed in 
science and mathematics. 

Factors that Affect the Success of Ameri can Indian High School Students in Science 



American Indian high school students like many other minorities have generally performed 
poorly in science courses, taken fewer higher level courses and scored below average on tests of 
science understanding. Few have chosen to go on to higher education in science and therefore are 
also very underrepresented in science careers (Barba, 1994). In light of these and other similar 
statistics, it is essential that science educators assume responsibility and leadership in the effort to 
overcome the lack of success among students from diverse backgrounds like American Indians. 
One of the major themes of national reform efforts in science has been the democratic goal of 
raising the general science literacy of all Americans (Rutherford and Ahlgren, 1990). Identifying 
and focusing on appropriate science curricula and strategies that deliver effective science instruction 
for multicultural populations like American Indians should be an essential part of this goal. An 
important outcome of effective science preparation might be that scientifically prepared American 
Indian students could assume leadership roles on their reservations and in their communities in a 
variety of science related fields including medicine, the environment, education and technology. 

This section will include specific factors that research results indicate may influence the 
success of American Indian high school students in science. These research results were based 
primarily on two studies on Navajo high school students conducted by the author: 

1 . an experimental study that compared student success in a traditional Biology course with 
one which infused tribal cultural components into the curriculum and strategies (Keating, 
1996). 

2 . a correlation dissertation study that investigated a number of factors that might affect 
success of Navajo students in science (Keating, 1992).

These considerations are based broadly on these and other research studies, as well as 
extensive personal experience working with American Indian students (Keating, 1992; Keating, 
1996 and Killackey, 1989). In addition to these findings, there are also corresponding 
implications for educators which will also be discussed. 

Although there are obviously multiple factors that affect everyone’s success in an academic 
setting, this discussion focuses on three broad influences that impact American Indian students: (a) 
the degree of traditionalism of the individual student; (b) the school environment including 
backgrounds of the teachers, strategies and curricula utilized; and (c) the socio-economic 
background of the students including per capita income, family educational background and 
general home environment 

The Effect of Cultural Trad itions on Science Learning 

American Indian languages have little or no correspondence to the technical language of 
science. American Indian students’ native languages may often have conflicts with English in 
semantic, syntactic and graphic-phonic components which make effective use of scientific 
terminology and concepts more difficult For example there are no corresponding words in Navajo 
for photosynthesis or inertia. Research results indicated that Navajo students achieve less and have 
lower positive attitudes in those science classes where teachers fail to recognize this and 
consequently do not make appropriate adaptations. The implication is that teachers who utilize 
strategies that link science terminology to native language will have more success with their 
students. Examples of some strategies used by teachers in more successful classrooms (i.e. where 
their students demonstrated greater success in science achievement and positive attitudes) were use 
of the four square model, visual aides and dual dictionaries and attendance at Navajo language 
courses. The four square model utilizes a poster format with four equal squares — one square has 
the English word, a second a hyphenated corresponding native language word, a third has an 
illustr ati on of the term and the fourth a definition and (or) examples. Visuals include the use of 
posters, slides, video tapes, computer software or realia. Teachers who take at least some course

work in Navajo (or other American Indian language) will learn to appreciate the differences 
between the languages and be more likely to make appropriate adaptations in their own classes 
(Keating, 1992). 

Cultural taboos may cause conflict between some of the materials or concepts used in 
science . In the Navajo culture for example, dissection of frogs and some other animals is 
considered a taboo whose violation may result in severe consequences that only very elaborate 
ceremonials can offset. The presence of and (or) touching bones and other remains from humans 
and certain animals is also a serious taboo with serious consequences. There are also many others 
which have direct implications for the teaching of science (Keating, 1992; Bulow, 1972). The 
implication of this cultural tradition is that science teachers need to become familiar with common 
taboos through reading, cultural training and direct interaction with the community so that they may 
seek ways to modify, adapt or circumvent those situations which might present a conflict for their 
students. Examples of adaptations utilized by teachers in more successful classrooms included use 
of computer software for dissections, avoidance of topics related to taboos substituting equivalent 
but different concepts. 

Behavioral expectations of teachers (non-Indian) for their students can cause conflict in the 
classroom. For example, in the Navajo tradition the role of the student is as a listener not an 
active, vocal participant This is based on the cultural mores that a student respects the teacher by 
listening, not asking questions or responding as many non-Navajo teachers would expect from 
their students (Rhodes, 1988; Keating, 1992). Also, the common English response ‘thank-you’ 
is traditionally infrequently given probably due to the fact that the Navajo word for ‘thank-you’ 
(ahe’hee’) is reserved only for extenuating situations. Appreciation for assistance, is however, 
often given in other less direct ways such as a small gift or invitation to dinner. The same 
considerations and implications that applied to taboos would apply to gaining an understanding of 
these types of cultural behavioral differences. Teachers who understood these and made 
appropriate modifications in their own personal responses to traditional American Indian behaviors 
tended to have more successful science classrooms. 




455 



The importance of reaching out to understand language and cultural differences cannot be 
over-emphasized. The research studies support the idea that students tend to respect and have 
greater rapport with those teachers who demonstrate this sensitivity, ultimately resulting in greater 
achievement and positive attitudes in science. 

The Effect of the School Environment on Science Learning 

Typical teaching styles observed on reservation high schools include a heavy emphasis on 
strategies such as direct instruction (lecture), use of textbooks as the primary source for 
information, individualized seat work and standardized short answer assessments. Although all of 
these more traditional strategies have some value in science instruction, an overemphasis appears to 
creates a mismatch with the typical learning styles of American Indians as well as for science 
students in general. For example, the research results lend support for the value of using a variety 
of strategies with some, in particular, being especially effective. More successful Navajo science 
students, as measured by increased problem solving, greater positive attitudes and similar content 
achievement (compared to teachers using more traditional strategies) tended to be in classrooms 
where teachers placed an emphasis on a variety of strategies. The most successful ones included 
these particular strategies: cooperative learning, field trips, computer simulations, hands-on 
activities, group projects and authentic forms of assessment (portfolio, journals and performance 
exams) (Keating, 1992, 1996 and Killackey, 1988). 

It is interesting that all of these correspond to traditional American Indian learning and 
teaching. For example, American Indians traditionally learned in small groups by practicing a task 
over and over until it was mastered and then demonstrating this to the elder (application of 
cooperative groups and performance exams). Also, holistic concepts are integrated throughout the 
learning experience, such as, individual success is devalued compared to the importance of success 
of the group (group projects); the connection of learning in a natural setting as compared to a 
classroom (use of field trips) (Rhodes, 1988). The implications of this is that teachers should be 



O 

ERIC 



456 



trained in the theory and practice of these innovative strategies and encouraged to apply them in 
their science teaching. 

Typical science curricula stress topics or individuals that make few connections to 
American Indians. Results from research that evaluated curricula that incorporated tribal science 
showed increases in self esteem and attitudes (Killackey, 1988) as well as problem solving, choice 
of courses and careers (science) (Keating, 1996; Keating, 1997)). In these studies tribal resources, 
materials and philosophy were connected to western science concepts. In this bicultural approach 
students used the tribal cultural contexts as a way to learn western science. Examples of topics 
used included the use of ethnobotany, archeoastronomy, animal husbandry and architecture. Tribal 
elders, parents and medicine-men were used as resources to teach students and assist and train 
teachers and served as appropriate science role models. Alternative texts and supplementary 
resources were also used (Killackey, 1989; Keating, 1995; Mayes and Lacey, 1989). 

The important implication for science teachers is that it is crucial for them to seek curricular 
ideas and role models from their students. The teacher must become an active learner himself 
(herself) and be open to drawing a typically hesitant community and its resources into becoming an 
active participant in the instructional team. In this role it is important that the teacher is patient, 
humble and flexible in order to facilitate this change in the curricula. 

Most of the science teachers that teach American Indians are non-Indian and lack formal or 
informal training in the culture of their students and the appropriate pedagogy to teach science to 
them. Ninety-eight percent of high school science teachers on reservations schools are non-Indian. 
This does not preclude effective science teaching. However, if there were more American Indian 
teachers they could assist the non-Indian teachers in overcoming some of the cultural conflicts 
discussed earlier. There is some evidence that American Indian students respond better in classes 
taught by American Indian teachers (Keating, 1991). 

Because of the many conflicts that science as taught presents to the traditional American 
Indian student few choose science or science teaching as a career. This is starting to change as 
colleges and universities offer teacher training programs which emphasize the culture as a strength 




457 



48 



for learning. For example, Navajo Community College’s Dine Philosophy of Learning or DPL 
attempts to incorporate elements of Navajo culture into all of the mainstream courses it offers. In 
addition, the college requires that all of its degrees including pre-service teaching include 
coursework in Navajo cultural studies as well as written and spoken Navajo. Many of these 
courses are also being taken by non-Navajo teachers at convenient satellite centers around the 
reservation. The University of New Mexico is offering an undergraduate education degree in 
Gallup, New Mexico which makes appropriate cultural connections. Because it is offered at 
convenient times this program is increasing immensely the number of Navajo teachers— some of 
whom will teach science. Using this as a model, other tribes should be encouraging educational 
institutes to provide opportunities for both inservice and preservice teachers to train in both 
appropriate cultural and pedagogical aspects of teaching. 

The Effect of Socio-Economic Factors on Science Learning 

American Indians typically live well below the poverty level~a factor which has an effect 
on all people regardless of ethnic, racial or cultural background. Low per capita income levels were 
found among the Navajo where 67% of families are below the poverty level and unemployment 
averages 40% (Keating, 1992). Many families do not have running water or electricity and also 
lack sufficient funds to provide proper nutrition for their children who typically have to spend 
many hours a week on buses. All of these are obvious impediments for students to function 
effectively in schools. Results from one of the studies indicated a strong association between 
family income and success in science achievement and attitudes. Although schools and individual 
teachers cannot solve all of these socio-economic ills they can assist in lessening effects of this 
economic gap. For example a few reservation schools have opened science labs, computer rooms, 
libraries and gymnasiums after school hours. They have provided resource people to assist parents 
and students in a variety of educational and health related activities. Some have also offered 
enrichment programs in science such as MESA (Minority Engineering and Science Association), 
the Odyssey of the Mind, Science Fair and Science Olympiad, which provide science experiences

not normally available during the school day. To facilitate these after school functions, the schools 
have provided activity buses to transport students home — much like those previously offered only 
to athletes. Only a few schools are doing this, but these enlightened schools, administrators and 
teachers are to be commended and should serve as models to others. Without programs like these, 
few of these students would have access at home to books, computers, televisions, phones and 
other school resources. 

Alcoholism on reservations results in a fairly large population of children with fetal alcohol 
syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol effects (FAE), both of which impact educational performance. 
Some estimates have been as high as 15-25% for the number of children bom on the Navajo 
reservation with FAS or FAE. Since both produce effects that cause a variety of learning disorders 
it is important for science teachers to address the issues of alcohol abuse and its biological effects 
on developing fetuses within their curricula. Public health hospitals, individual doctors and tribal 
officials involved with drug and alcohol abuse are all good resources for the science teacher. The 
science teacher using appropriate strategies to present this topic can have an effect on student 
perception of the use and abuse of alcohol and perhaps make their students more cognizant of the 
dangers thereby ultimately reducing the number of FAS and FAE students in their own 
classrooms. 

Most American Indian students from this present generation are the first in their families to 
seek a higher degree. Research results found that few of the parents in the study had higher 
education degrees with a fairly high percent not having completed high school (Keating, 1992). 
Only about 5% of Navajo students entering college complete a four year degree within six years 
with very few of these in a science or technology field (Willeto, 1991). This is compared to the 
national average rate of completion of about 50%. It is therefore vital that high schools encourage 
the parents to take an active role in the education of their sons and daughters. Encouragement and 
support from home is the number one predictor of success in College among American Indian 
students (Willetto, 1991). Schools and individual teachers can play an active role in this process. 
As discussed earlier the American Indian community can play a tremendous role in the curriculum 




459 



482 



as a resource for the teachers. This can also play a dual role of drawing parents and individuals to 
the school and making them feel welcome in this setting. Other formats in which parents were 
encouraged and become involved in the (science) education of their children included as 
coach/advisors in the Odyssey of the Mind program— an international, interdisciplinary problem 
solving program and as mentors/judges in science fair competitions. Another science related 
program which encourages parents to become actively involved within the school include Math, 
Science and Beyond — a family hands-on science and math evening program (Solana Beach 
Elementary School District, 1990). 

It is suggested that there is a much greater potential for American Indian students success in 
science when their parents are presented with opportunities that welcome and encourage them to 
become actively involved with the schools through collaborative teaching, mentorships and 
participation in science programs. 

Conclusions 

Based on research results and personal experiences in teaching American Indian (especially 
Navajo’s) it was concluded that a variety of factors have an effect on the success of high school 
students. These factors were categorized into three major areas: (a) the degree of traditionalism of 
the individual student; (b) the school environment; and (c) the socio-economic background of the 
students. 

Impediments to success in each area were noted with corresponding implications and 
suggested recommendations for science teachers and their schools. It was suggested that the 
tremendous cultural wealth of American Indians could be strongly linked to high school science 
programs as a resource. Using a bicultural linkage of the curriculum to the community will provide 
a basis of support and encouragement for the students attending these schools increasing the 
potential for success in science. 

It is critical that the science education of American Indian students be improved. Tribes 
need members that include those that are science literate, as well as active, knowledgeable 




460 



483 



participants in science leadership roles as they continue to grow in the areas of technology, the 
environment, medicine and other science related areas. 

Schools and the American Indian communities should consider some of these suggested 
recommendations and based on their own perceived needs, develop site based plans that attempt to 
incorporate some of the ideas. 



Overcoming Com mon Barriers 

There are many common barriers faced by Hispanic and American Indian students entering 
science and mathematics. These are often created by conflicts between the traditional culture of the 
these students and the methods typically used in teaching in K-12 science and mathematics. 

Examples of common barriers to their success and potential career opportunities include 
language impediments to the learning of the technical language of science and mathematics, cultural 
taboos related to specific scientific activities, income disparity and poverty, and a shortage of 
mentors and role models in education as well as in the sciences and mathematics. Because of these 
and other related factors, young Hispanic and American Indian students have had a common 
absence of positive experiences and successes in science and mathematics at the early grade levels 
that has resulted in a correspondingly negative attitude about these fields. In addition, many 
Hispanics and American Indian students have not received encouragement or opportunities to excel 
in traditional science and mathematics careers. 

Hispanic and American Indian parents and their extended families, many of whom have 
had similar negative experiences in schools, have consequently had limited involvement in the 
education process, and almost no involvement in science and mathematics. All of this has 
contributed to teacher expectations that have been less than positive with regard to the success of 
these students in science and mathematics classrooms. This lack of support from parents, 
communities, and educational systems makes it unfeasible for most Hispanics and American 
Indians to even consider pursuing further education and careers in science and mathematics.

We recommend that teachers develop a knowledge base about the various cultures 
(including languages) of their students, and incorporate this cultural knowledge into their teaching 
strategies and curriculum. It is essential for teachers to understand the cultural traditions of their 
students, especially in areas that may cause students to have restricted positive experiences in 
science and mathematics. It is also important for teachers to have an appreciation of the learning 
styles and strengths of their students, particularly those whose backgrounds differ from the 
mainstream. In light of this, teachers should closely monitor their own spoken and unspoken 
expectations of Hispanic and American Indian students with regard to success in science and 
mathematics, and they should extend their own education and understandings so that they may 
meet the needs of and encourage all students in traditional fields of study. 

In addition to the role of the teacher and school in increasing success of these students in 
science and mathematics, the parents and the community need to be invited to participate in K-12 
science and mathematics curriculum, events and studies. This enriched curriculum will then be 
reflective of the students’ experiences, culture and language, and the corresponding assessment 
practices will be appropriately linked to contexts within the culture providing a greater potential for 
successfully revealing what students do not know. 

Science and mathematics teacher educators have an important role in this whole process in 
that they must be knowledgeable about the various cultures that make up American society, and 
must incorporate and model multicultural education strategies into their own teaching. To 
accomplish this, they should be at the forefront and be familiar with the research on multicultural 
science and mathematics education so that they can effectively teach preservice and inservice 
teachers how to infuse cultural knowledge and practices into K-12 science and mathematics 
instruction.

WOMEN, WIFE, MOMMY, AND SCIENTIST: HELPING FEMALES 
SEE THEMSELVES IN SCIENCE 

Juanita Jo Matkins, Virginia Commonwealth University 

Purpose of the Study 

The purpose of this study was to determine the enabling and potentially disabling factors in 
the lives of contemporary women scientists, factors which either facilitated their goals of being 
scientists or which had the potential to obstruct their paths toward their goals. This study was an 
examination of the lives of women scientists from their early memories to their lives at the 
conclusion of the study in 1996. The women scientists in the study were encouraged to explore 
their own lives for factors which enabled them to become scientists and for factors which enabled 
them to maintain their credibility in their careers. Also examined were the social factors important 
in their lives, including friendships, family interactions, romances, marriage, and motherhood. The 
factors which contributed to the participants' achievements were characterized as enabling factors. 

In addition to enabling factors, the participants in the study revealed factors in their lives 
which had the potential to prevent their pursuit of science studies, or to cause detours from 
intended study and career. Since other young women who lacked an array of enabling factors 
could be dissuaded by the disabling factors, it was important to consider not only what brought the 
participants of this study to their science, but also what could have kept them from their calling. 

Through understanding both enabling and potentially disabling factors in the participants' 
lives, college science educators and K-12 teachers will have a more complete understanding of the 
dilemmas females face when deciding whether or not to take higher level science courses and 
consider a science major. Parents and educators can anticipate the needs and concerns of talented 
young women. Also, premises against which the credibility of scientists are judged can be re- 
examined to ensure that talented women in the sciences who are also wives and mothers have 
opportunity and support for their work in science. 




465 



Conceptual Framework 

The problem of attracting women into science courses and into pursuing science careers has 
been the focus of many studies (Koballa, 1988; Kahle, 1990; American Association of University 
Women, 1992; Erickson & Erickson, 1994). In his pivotal essay on the need for including various 
aspects of society in the scientific dialogue, The Two Cultures (1962), C. P. Snow emphasized the 
deficit in potential knowledge suffered by the scientific community due to the virtual exclusion of 
females from the ranks of scientific academics. In a study of intended majors of college freshman, 
Vetter ( 1987) found that 14% of the female freshmen intended to major in a science area, 
contrasted with 40% of the males. As they got nearer to the conclusion of their education, the 
proportion of women who dropped science majors increased (Berryman, 1983; Matyas, 1986). 
Dresselhaus, Franz, & Gark (1994) reported that the proportion of women to men in science 
faculty positions in the United States was much lower than the proportion of women to men in 
undergraduate and graduate science degree programs. Thus, despite modestly successful efforts to 
bring women into the sciences during the past several decades, a deficit still existed in the scientific 
community. 

If women were to be included in the scientific community in a meaningful way, it was not 
enough to determine how to persuade girls to aspire to science careers and to take higher level 
science classes in high school. Attention must also be given to the processes at play in 
undergraduate and graduate studies, as well as in the transition between student and practicing 
scientist. In addition, a broader understanding of the processes was needed, one which went 
beyond academic preparation to the social influences (Kahle, 1990). In a ten-year study of high 
school valedictorians, Arnold (1993) found that females were twice as likely as males to be married 
at the end of the ten years, and the females who were not married expected to experience conflict 
between work and family goals should they many. Of the women physicists in the Arnold study, 
most, in retrospect, felt ambivalent about their career choice, and all predicted they would cut back 
on work at some point for childrearing. It could be concluded from the Arnold study that it was

improbable that a person could be a woman, with the contingent roles of wife and mother, and be a 
scientist. 

Methodology 

In this study, an emergent design was utilized of the type described by Lincoln and Guba 
(1985), involving field observations and individual semi- structured interviews. Two tape-recorded 
interviews were conducted with each participant. The first interview involved general questions 
and responses, and the second interview was structured through focused questions derived from 
examination of the first interviews and the development of coding schemes from the information 
obtained in those first interviews. The strategy for development of the coding schemes was a 
variation of the cross-case analysis/inductive approach described by Glaser and Strauss (1967). 
The second interviews were conducted a year following the first interviews, and all interviews 
were conducted within the same two-year time period. Case studies were developed for each 
individual interviewed, and a cross-case analysis was developed. From these case studies and the 
cross-case analysis, conclusions were derived about the enabling and disabling factors for these 
women in becoming scientists and in maintaining credibility as scientists. 

Trustworthiness of the results and conclusions of this study was established through the use 
of member (participant) checking of transcripts, case studies and analyses, and of conclusions. An 
external auditor certified the data acquisition and coding process. A peer reviewer examined the 
study documents for consistency of data with results and conclusions. 

The participants in this study were six women scientists from various science disciplines: a 
meteorologist, a forensic pathologist, a geologist, a physicist/astronaut, and two astronomers. 
Selection of participants was accomplished through discussion with scientific professionals and the 
solicitation of their recommendations as to who would be valuable participants in this study. Ages 
of the participants at the conclusion of the study ranged from 32 to 67 years old. The meteorologist 
was the first woman Senior Scientist at a major atmospheric research facility. The forensic 
pathologist is Chief Medical Examiner for her state. The geologist is in a tenure-track position at 
her university, and has recently returned from a year of maternity leave to full-time teaching and

research in volcanic/tectonic geology. The physicist/astronaut flew on four Space Shuttle missions, 
experienced several spacewalks and served as Mission Commander in charge of the anti-gravity 
research on her last mission. One of the astronomers is a recipient of the Presidential Medal of 
Freedom and a member of the National Academy of Science. The other astronomer is the first 
female to be awarded a tenured position in her university's astronomy department. Participants 
granted permission for use of their information in the study. Specific identities are confidential and 
pseudonyms are used. 



Nature of the Data 

The data of this study consisted of information from the two interviews with the participants 
and from observations of the researcher as recorded in field notes. The results were derived from 
case studies which were developed from information from the interview transcripts and from the 
observations of the researcher. An abbreviated passage from each case study follows. 
Meteorologist: Libby 

Childhood 

Third grade show and tell was especially exciting that day for the little girl in the second row. 
It was Tuesday, her row’s turn, and she had something for show and tell that had never been seen 
in her midwest elementary classroom. Libby’s house had been struck by lightning the night before, 
and she had brought in bricks knocked from the chimney and pieces of woven plastic from where 
the bricks had hit the lawn furniture and shredded the seats and backs. Before lightning struck her 
house Libby had wanted to be a fireman, but this event changed her mind. Now, she wanted to 
study weather. 

Forensic Scientist and Chief Medical Examiner Sophy 

Childhood 

Sophy's father died when Sophy was 13, leaving Sophy's mother to raise Sophy and her 
nine-year-old sister. This did not prevent Sophy from being involved with outside activities. Her 
mother had managed the finances for the family even before her father's death, and afterwards 



Sophy and her mother took primary responsibility for household repairs. There was barely enough 
money for essentials, much less to pay others for repairs and maintenance of the home. Sophy 
recalled the repair of a concrete wall in the basement, when she and her mother took out all the 
crumbling mortar and replaced it. Few household repairs were beyond their capabilities, and 
Sophy learned to wield a paintbrush, hammer, chisel, shovel, and rake with finesse. 

Geologist: Sue 

Profession. Marriage, and Motherhood 

At the time of the first interview, Sue had been married less than a year. When she was asked 
what she saw herself doing in the next five years, Sue immediately replied, "I'd like to have a 
child." She was unsure about the changes having a child would bring, including the risk to getting 
tenure, yet she was almost 34 years old and her husband was 50. "We're married now, and want 
to have a baby now!" Patricia was bom in the late summer of the following year. Six months later 
the second interview took place in the charmingly chaotic setting commonly found in the living 
rooms of homes with babies. 

Astronaut/Phvsicist: Carol 

Profession. Marriage, and Motherhood 

Carol applied to the NASA astronaut program, and was notified of her acceptance in 1984. 
She became an astronaut in 1985, and five months later gave birth to her second daughter. By this 
time she was living near the NASA space center where astronauts underwent their training, and her 
husband remained at their home hundreds of miles away. Though functioning for the most part as 
a single mother, she did not anguish over her responsibilities with her children. 

You choose what you do with those twenty-four hours in a day . . . You just concentrate 
on what's important in each of these areas, and let everything else go. I take care of my 
kids as best I can. I'm not always there for them, but they're pretty independent little kids 
right now, probably because of that. I wouldn't win the Good Housekeeping Award, but 
it’s sanitary and livable [at my house], and that's good enough for us.

Astronomer Florence 

Profession and Motherhood 

While reflecting upon motherhood, Florence discussed the reason she thought it was 
important for her to do her science: 

Having children was in no way antagonistic to being a scientist. You have to have a life. 

Y ou either have to scrub your floor or go to the telescope, and I'd much rather go to the 
telescope than scrub the floor .... We ALL work, whether we're doing something 
ennobling and elegant or something horrible .... So, just having the children, having 
them around, was never a problem for the science. 

Among the aspects of science that Florence found distasteful, and which she had avoided 
was the "very rough level" of competition she had encountered. Florence wanted to do things at 
her own pace. She confessed she had even avoided some research because it was too popular, 
implying that she didn't want the popularity of the topic to cause her to feel pressure to rush her 
work or tailor her work to avoid someone else's topic. "I didn't like the intense scientific 
competition ... I didn't like being attacked." Florence hoped that her own conscious decision to 
resist that aspect of science research would contribute, along with other women's efforts, to 
changing the way things were done. 

Astronomer Maria 

College 

Though most doctoral students spend three or four years completing their work and getting 
their degree, Maria was seven years at the university. Maria remembered that the attitude of the 
faculty was rather distant and she did not feel the faculty were interested in students as individuals. 
There was a sense of competition, with students ranked by the faculty for preference in funding for 
professional conference attendance and other special considerations. Competitive pressure was 
compounded by the knowledge that there were plenty of applicants to replace Maria and the other 
students if they did not meet the doctoral standards. However, there was no explaining the unfair 
grading practices, where Maria and a classmate would have virtually the same answer and "I'd get 




470 



50% and the other, you know, the guy, would get 100% for the question." When she checked 
around, Maria discovered the women in the class were the ones getting the low grades. She was 
consistently told by an advisor that she needed to "do more," and when she did more it still was 
not enough. Her major advisors were remembered as unkind, unappreciative, unsupportive, and 
even obstructive. After seven years, Maria threatened her doctoral thesis advisor - she was 
embarrassed to admit she even swore at him. If he didn't set her dissertation defense within 24 
hours, she was going to the chairman of the department and telling him she was quitting graduate 
school. She didn't care anymore about becoming an astronomer; she just wanted to get out of that 
university. 



Results 

The primary enabling factor in the lives of these women was a determination to become a 
scientist. Markus and Nurius (1986) named the expectation of reaching such a goal as the sense of 
"possible self." These women had a pronounced sense of possible-self-as-a-scientist. Certain 
consistent supporting elements preserved this sense of possible self: a supportive home situation 
and the contribution of parents. Other factors which were important included strong maternal role 
models, expectation of financial responsibility, support of husbands, availability of spousal 
employment, childhood opportunity to participate in activities outside the school setting, and 
single-sex schools. 

Potentially disabling factors included sexist aspects of K-12 and graduate schools, of 
professional life in science, paternalism of institutions, living apart from husbands, teacher 
attitudes, and extreme competitiveness. This competitiveness was manifested in discussion styles 
both in class and informally, and in social and assessment situations. In many circumstances there 
was a contrast between the treatment of male students and female students. Women experienced 
situations where major professors took longer to approve their work than similar work submitted 
by male students, and the professors required more revisions. In one event, an innocent 
mentor/mentee relationship was marred by academic society gossip. Lack of confidence in one's 




471 



own abilities, a factor spotlighted in DeBoer's study in 1986, was a component in an array of 
insecurities experienced by one of the women. Several of the women recalled discomfort at the low 
number of women colleagues they had around them during their graduate studies. 

All the women had husbands who were academics or scientific professionals, and none of 
the women have ever been divorced. All had children. Neither marital nor maternity status of the 
participants had been a stated quality for selection as a participant in this study, yet all participants 
were married, in apparently stable relationships, and were mothers. 

Conclusions 

The underlying importance of parental support is paramount. Though schools may want to 
shoulder the responsibility for encouraging young women in science, it must be recognized that 
parents are necessary partners in the enterprise. Family considerations and an emphasis on 
relationships were also crucial to the perseverance of these women. A component of this study of 
women scientists was their emphasis on the importance of the support of their husbands, and of 
other male mentors and friends. The fact that all these women were still married to their first 
husbands, or were widows who remarried, indicated a commitment to being wives as well as 
scientists. By the end of the study all the families had children, which again indicated a 
commitment to a feminine role while fulfilling the role of woman scientist. 

Science educators have a responsibility to encourage girls in their classes and in informal 
interactions. These professionals also have a responsibility to inform and counsel others who are 
influential in the development of students. Recommendations to science educators for encouraging 
females in science include: 

1 . Advise parents about ways to enable their daughters. Inform parents of the importance of 
manipulative play and the freedom to explore, and of the benefits of teaching their daughters 
how to do some traditionally male tasks, such as fixing machinery. Inform parents of the 
importance and nature of effective parental support, especially in the form of rejection of 



traditional role assumptions. The women in this study were not told they couldn’t do things 
because they were female. 

2. Inform parents, other teachers, and guidance counselors of the benefit of establishing in girls 
expectations of financial independence. Communicate information about the range of options 
available for financing the education of aspiring female scientists from a wide range of family 
incomes. 

3 . Implement equity curricula in schools. 

4. Encourage girls to participate in organizations that develop their manipulative skills, such as 
Girl Scouts, Campfire Girls, and 4-H clubs. 

5. Provide experiences for girls, in and out of school, so that they have opportunity, time, and 
materials for working through an activity in order for manipulative skills, proportional 
reasoning, spatial awareness, and self-confidence to be facilitated. 

6. Encourage single-sex schools for the purpose of developing a sense of possible-self-as- 
scientist. Inform parents and school system personnel of the benefits of single-sex schools as 
revealed in the stories of these six women scientists. While attending a single-sex school, 
encourage girls to develop qualities of leadership, academic excellence, and to recognize these 
qualities in themselves. If single-sex schools are not available, provide single-sex classes in 
physics and chemistry. Encourage girls to take advantage of such options. If those options are 
not available, girls should be encouraged to take physics and chemistry classes regardless of 
the number of other girls taking the class. 

7. Encourage behaviors in female friends which support the development of self-confidence in 
others. These behaviors include a regard for intellectual achievement and also of feminine 
characteristics cited in this study, such as an appreciation of cooperative as well as competitive 
abilities. 

8. Inform the faculties of colleges and universities of the stories of these women and of their 
expressions of the importance of having women students and faculty in the sciences to serve as 
a community of females within which women can identify. 





473 



9. Inform teachers, parents, and guidance counselors of the importance of relationships with 
family and friends to a girl's sense of identity. 

10. Encourage boys to support the development of self-confidence in their female friends, and 
inform boys of the positive role that male friends played in the lives of the participants in this 
study. 

12. Inform girls of the potential benefits of developing supportive friendships with boys. 

13. Advise teachers of the impact of extreme competitiveness and pressure upon students, and of 
the potential loss of talented scientists when such competitiveness is emphasized. 

Most importantly, science educators should examine their own practices and critically assess 
and adapt their attitudes and behaviors related to females. Cultural pressures are pervasive and 
insidious, and, as such, influence us all. If science educators are to advise others, they must first 
look to themselves. 



Significance 

Despite various potentially disabling situations where others in academic situations attempted 
to drive home the message of female inferiority, these women had sufficient self confidence and 
sense of possible self to outweigh the sexism encountered. They succeeded, yet their reflections 
upon their success revealed probable reasons why so many others did not and do not succeed. 

The long-term goal of this study, to determine factors which enable women in the sciences, 
was chosen in hope of finding avenues for opening doors for more women in the sciences, women 
who may not be so determined and assured. The fact that these six women are so competent and 
valuable to science makes the sexism they encountered especially appalling. Often, it was implicit 
and well-meaning, yet thoughtless. An aspect of implicit sexism not often recognized is the lack of 
women in the field, and how that discourages other women from entering the field. 

Explicit sexism was undeniable in some of the stories. Stories remembered by Florence and 
Sophy, who received their training in the 1950's and 1960's, are replete with denial of opportunity 
and with venomous intent. Considering these cases, it might seem that explicit sexism was an 




474 43 7 



artifact of the recent past. However, Libby, Maria, and Sue told of difficulties connected to explicit 
sexism in high school, undergraduate, and graduate school, as well as in their professional 
experiences. Recognition of the contributions of the six women to science came reluctantly from 
many of the men in their professional spheres, as though the men could only see value in thought 
which was an extension of their tradition. The lives of these six women refuted the assumption 
among most young females that pursuing science careers would mean giving up or greatly altering 
the feminine roles of wife and mother. Though they expressed many frustrations about situations 
encountered in the pursuit of their credentials, and about circumstances which presented challenges 
as they functioned as mothers, wives, and women scientists, they were confident in their own 
futures. They revealed that there is a place for women in the sciences that is compatible with 
femininity. The term "woman scientist" is not an oxymoron.

VOLITIONAL CHANGE IN ELEMENTARY TEACHERS’ 
CONCEPTIONS OF SCIENCE PEDAGOGY VIA A GENERATIVE 
LEARNING MODEL OF TEACHING 

Vickie D. Harry, Clarion University of PA 



A Study of Change 

Past studies in science education have examined the problem of changing children’s 
conceptions about scientific ideas and theories. However, such studies have routinely centered on 
the conceptual changes in the learner’s thinking about science, not change in the teacher’s 
conceptions of pedagogy as it relates to the meaningful teaching and learning of science in the 
elementary school. 

“Change is a process of coming to grips with new personal meaning, and so it is a learning 
process” (Fullan & Miles, 1995, p. 408). The personal meaning of change for teachers is intrinsic 
to successful reform and change in science education. Introducing the methodology of the 
Generative Learning Model (GLM) of teaching (Osborne & Freyberg, 1985) to the participants in 
this study provided the means for the teachers to experience new meaning and new learning about 
science pedagogy. 

The organizational structure created by American education often neglects the needs of 
teachers as adult learners. In the past, educational reformers looked at inservice programs and 
workshops as vehicles to fix what they perceived to be wrong with teachers and schools. This 
mindset produces teachers who never gain control of any area of practice where they are in charge 
or are viewed as experts (Lortie, 1975). When principals, superintendents, and school 
administrators are presumed to be persons of greater expertise and standing, daily teaching 
operations and pedagogy are dominated by persons in other roles, not by the teachers themselves. 
Without ownership of the ideas presented in the program or workshop, teachers are unlikely to 
fully adopt the ideas into their practices. 

Professional development is still under scrutiny by curriculum reformers. The traditional 
approach of using teacher development and inservice programs as a setting to “fix” schools is still 




477

in practice. Connelly and Clandinin (1988) find remnants of the teacher-proofing idea in 
government policy documents of centralized countries worldwide. These curricular materials 
minimize teacher influence and were developed to treat the existing school problems. Connelly and 
Clandinin (1988) ask workshop presenters and participants a soul-searching question. 

If workshops train teachers to teach in certain ways, how is this any different, in principle, 
from bypassing teachers altogether in teacher proofing of curriculum materials? There are, 
of course, many excellent professional development and teacher workshops. We want 
teachers to be able to judge for themselves whether the professional activities in which they 
engage are educational or whether they are designed as an alternative to teacher proofing. It 
is your professional development. You must judge, (p. 139) 

As science educators reexamine the purpose and the goals of teacher workshops and 
inservice programs, the emphasis again falls on the teachers themselves. The understanding of the 
pivotal role of teachers in the process of change and innovation in science education is of the 
utmost importance. 

Teachers as Adult Learners 

Adult learning theorists (Knowles 1984; Mezirow, 1989) believe that adults become 
increasingly self-directed and that their readiness to learn is stimulated by real life tasks and 
problems. Mezirow (1990) proposes that learning takes place through the analysis of problems 
and the generation of themes that are the content of a learning situation. Mezirow ’s theory of 
perspective transformation deals directly with learning through the process of critical reflection. 
The critical reflection results in transformative learning through the insights of self-reflection and 
the realization of how perceptions can be changed to allow new possibilities for meaning. 

To make meaning the adult makes sense of an experience and then interprets the experience 
to guide his or her actions. Distortions in beliefs and errors in problem solving are then corrected 
by reflection, a synonym for higher-order mental processes in this theory. But the critical 
reflection, concerned with the why and the reasons for consequences, is not part of the immediate 
action process. A hiatus, an anomaly, or a dilemma that challenges or disorients the learner’s 



current way of knowing initiates the transformation. The impetus for perspective transformation 
mimics the conditions for a theory of conceptual change (Piaget, 1963; Posner, Strike, Hewson, & 
Getzog, 1982) when dissatisfaction with current understandings exists and the learner begins to 
look for a plausible alternative. 

Conceptual Learning 

Since the late 1970s Posner, et al. (1 982) asked teachers to facilitate the learner’s 
accommodation of new conceptions in science through a theory of conceptual change. Inquiry, 
children’s questions, the science process skills, and discrepant events are integral parts of science 
instruction used by teachers to promote conceptual change. The slowly evolving process of 
conceptual change requires time to test ideas and to manipulate materials during experimentation. 
After the learner confronts errors in understanding, a new concept replaces the old concept through 
the process of reflective thinking about observations and findings from tests and experiments. 
Learners bring their idiosyncratic and personal experiences to most learning situations. 
These experiences have a profound effect on the learners’ views of the world and a startling 
effect on their willingness and ability to accept other, more scientifically grounded 
explanations of how the world works. Teachers who take a personal, adaptive view of 
knowledge are known as constructivists because their model of learning posits that all 
knowledge is constructed by the individual in a scheme of accommodation and 
assimilation. (Watson & Konicek, 1990, p. 682) 

Generative Learning 

Osborne and Wittrock (1983) describe learning science as a generative process of 
constructing meaning from one's own memories, knowledge, and experiences, and from incoming 
sensory information. When a learner does something with that information, "that something is the 
generation, the active relating of the pupil's knowledge, logic, and experiences to parts of the 
statement or explanation, and the construction of meaning." (p. 499). Osborne and Freyberg 
( 1985) describe a teaching model that "requires active teaching by a teacher who clearly appreciates 
children's ideas, the scientific view to be encouraged, the types of activities that might achieve 




479 



502 



conceptual change, and the associated interactive teaching sequences which need to be adopted" 

(p. 111). 

The Generative Learning Model encompasses a four phase teaching sequence that includes 
the preliminary, focus, challenge, and application phases. Cosgrove and Osborne (1985) propose 
this model for three specific objectives: "clarification of the pupil's existing views, modification of 
these views towards the current scientific view, and consolidation of the scientific view within the 
background and values of the pupils." (p. 107). 

The view held by Osborne and Freyberg (1985) and those utilizing the GLM recognizes 
that new ideas can be constructed only through sensory input by using existing ideas in memory 
store. Practicing teachers have their own interpretations of the experience of teaching science. An 
innovation, the GLM, prompts teachers to reflect about current practices and empowers them to 
reconsider their conceptions about teaching and learning in science. 

The GLM is a particularly effective model used to identify and address student 
misconceptions about scientific phenomena. In the Preliminary Phase, the teacher applies a variety 
of methods to assess student preconceptions. Once the conceptions are identified, the teacher 
centers on interaction, both with physical phenomena and with peers, to aid learners in their 
restructuring of concepts during the Focus Phase. Mestre and Touger ( 1989) suggest that teachers 
should continually watch and carefully listen for conceptions that may emerge by allowing students 
ample opportunities to explain concepts in their own words in an atmosphere that is sensitive and 
receptive to their views. They add that “simply telling students that their conceptual understanding 
is wrong or incomplete, and combining this with a correct explanation, is often not sufficient for 
eradicating most misconceptions” (p. 450). During the Challenge Phase, the teacher facilitates the 
exchange of views, keeps discussion open, and presents the scientist’s view of the concepts in the 
lesson. Finally, during the Application Phase, the teacher contrives problems, assists students in 
clarifying the new view, and ensures that pupils can describe solutions to problems.

Workshops: An Introduction to Innovation 

Workshops are a means used to introduce an innovation or a new idea in science teaching. 
The presentation of the ideas for dissemination is an important foundation for change and reform in 
science education. In the analysis of the elements of innovation or a new approach Rogers (1962) 
lists four crucial components for the dissemination of ideas: (a) The innovation is an idea 
perceived as new by the individual; (b) Communication is the diffusion process in which one 
person communicates a new idea to another person; (c) The social system is the population of 
individuals who are cooperating to solve a common problem; (d) Adoption is the decision to 
continue full use of an innovation. Rogers’ ideas about crucial components for the dissemination 
of ideas apply to teachers and their opportunities for appraisal and adoption of innovation. The 
teacher workshop itself is an environment where communication takes place and diffusion of an 
innovation begins. 

The constructivist orientation in the design of professional development for teachers of 
science emphasizes the importance of personal cognition and social collegial ity in the learning 
process (Brown & Sinclair, 1993). Gore (1991) recommends program-specific workshops 
conducted by the university to provide a context for sharing and forming a more common 
knowledge base. 

Teacher learning is often not valued to the extent that teachers are provided with 
time to work with their peers, to reflect systematically on their teaching, to attend 
workshops to strengthen what they bring to their teaching or their involvement in student 
teaching. (Gore, 1991, p. 265) 

The constructivist view does not consider it possible for workshop presenters to transfer 
new ideas from the presenter to the participants by imparting instructions about curricular 
materials. The presenter actively engages the participants in hands-on/minds-on activities to 
improve the teachers’ abilities to engage students in scientific inquiry. The constructivist presenter 
offers opportunities for teachers to explore learning in inquiry-oriented situations, to share ideas 
across grade levels, and to integrate science with other disciplines. Instructional strategies 





481 



congruent with the constructivist epistemology include (a) the use of the science process skills by 
using data-gathering and data-processing components, (b) cooperative-group techniques, (c) 
productive questioning skills, and (d) discrepant events as a motivating technique are modeled 
during the workshop program. 

GLM Workshops in the Study of Change 

The researcher was the presenter for the staff development workshops held during the 
study. The GLM of teaching was introduced as an innovation at the workshops. An orientation to 
the constructivist perspective was achieved during the workshops through activities designed to 
build community spirit, research-based explanations describing the constructivist epistemology, 
and instructions about the conditions for conceptual change. The teachers participated in science 
activities exemplifying the phases of the GLM of teaching. Also, a guest at the first workshop 
presented video cases of teachers using the GLM in classroom settings. A laser disk program 
(Abell, Campbell, & Cennamo, 1994) further exemplified the model’s implementation. The 
participants shared ideas about science teaching and about the implementation of the GLM in the 
classroom at the second and third workshops. The researcher continued to model lessons and to 
exhibit the phases of the GLM. Peer teaching was also used to share examples of lessons 
implementing the GLM. 

The teachers in this study attended three staff development workshops centered on the 
innovation, the GLM of teaching. The conceptual change approach of the GLM represented new 
meaning and new learning in science education for the participants in the study. The GLM was an 
inducement for thinking about personal conceptual change in science pedagogy. The teachers 
experienced the model and then applied the concepts and ideas learned to the construction of 
personal knowledge about classroom practice. At the beginning of the study, each individual 
teacher approached a change in pedagogy from his or her own perspective. As the study 
progressed, the participants became a community of learners supporting each other during the 
project. The individual participants made sense of their personal meaning of the innovation and

then they shared their thinking and reflections to sustain the conditions for change during group 
discussions. 



Purpose of the Study 

The purpose of this study was to document and analyze the changes in the meanings, 
thoughts, and beliefs of practicing elementary school teachers about science pedagogy via a GLM 
of Teaching. The researcher and eight practicing teachers (co-researchers) engaged in heuristic 
research to explore adult learning and to reveal changes in teacher thinking about teaching and 
learning science in the elementary classroom. 

Research Methodology 

Since the 1960s and 1970s a different approach to research on teaching has emerged 
(Erickson, 1986). The social sciences used this approach for about seventy years previous to these 
decades. Erickson refers to the whole family of approaches to participant observational research as 
interpretive. Interpretive research can lead the researcher to search for the nature of environments, 
reflection, and meaning-perspectives. Issues, problems, and projects, especially in educational 
research, can use interpretation to define phenomena of interest. 

Heuristics, a form of phenomenological methodology, is concerned with meanings, 
essence, quality, and experience. A quantitative approach, in contrast, is concerned with 
measurements, appearances, quantity, and behavior. Heuristic research “epitomizes the 
phenomenological emphasis on meanings and knowing through personal experience; it exemplifies 
and places at the fore the way in which the researcher is the primary instrument in qualitative 
inquiry; and it challenges in the extreme traditional scientific concerns about researcher objectivity 
and detachment” (Patton, 1990, p. 73). In heuristic analysis, the insights and experiences of the 
analyst are primary to the creative synthesis of the total experience. 

The self of the researcher is present throughout the process, while understanding 

the phenomenon with increasing depth, the researcher also experiences growing 





483 



self-awarenesses and self-knowledge. Heuristic processes incorporate creative 
self-processes and self-discoveries. (Moustakas, 1990, p. 9) 

Heuristic research “refers to a process of internal search through which one discovers the nature 
and meaning of experience and develops methods and procedures for further investigation and 
analysis” (Moustakas, 1990, p. 9). 

Theoretical Framework: Heuristic Inquiry 

Heuristic inquiry, a form of phenomenology, asks the researcher to make meaning about 
the experiences of the phenomenon studied (Patton, 1990). The researcher's personal experiences 
and insights into a chosen phenomenon of intense interest require a theoretical framework beyond a 
purely phenomenological approach. The researcher's experiences with the phenomenon studied 
coupled with an intense point of view about the phenomenon, enable the researcher to develop and 
understand the essence of the meaning of the phenomenon. 

As the participants experience and reflect about the phenomenon studied, they, along with 
the principal researcher, come to understand the essence of the meaning of the phenomenon. The 
participants in the study become co-researchers (Patton, 1990). As the principal researcher and the 
co-researchers mutually strive to make meaning about the nature and the essence of their human 
experiences, they develop a connectedness through shared reflection and inquiry. 

Polanyi and Prosch (1975) describe the effects of human thought in heuristic terms. 

When one sees a problem and undertakes its pursuit, one sees a range of potentialities for 
meaning which one thinks are accessible. Heuristic tension in a mind seems therefore to be 
generated much as kinetic energy in physics is generated by the accessibility of stabler 
configurations. The tension in a mind, however, seems by contrast to be deliberate, (p. 
176) 

An interpretive study asking participants to analyze thoughts, meanings, and beliefs can best be 
characterized in Polanyi ’s (1958) terms as a heuristic act. He describes the adaptation of a 
framework to fit new experiences and the discovery of movement from one framework to another 
as heuristic vision. 




484 



The heuristic act of achieving innovation is not a routine application of new knowledge, but 
it is an act of invention and discovery. Polanyi talks about personal revisions of guiding 
assumptions that change the rules for interpreting our experiences. Challenging the rules and 
assumptions about teaching science may encourage a breakout from an established framework. 
Clandinin (1986) interprets Polanyi ’s descriptions of heuristic acts as “acts achieving innovation . . 

. . It relies on personal intervention for changing the rules” (p. 28). 

Moustakas ( 1990) defines heuristic inquiry as “a process that begins with a question or 
problem which the researcher seeks to illuminate or answer. The question is one that has been a 
personal challenge and puzzlement in the search to understand one’s self and the world in which 
one lives” (p. 15). Self-dialogue and self-discovery guided my requests for disclosure from the 
teachers in the study about their thoughts and beliefs. Our work together reveals the meanings and 
essences of teacher thinking about science pedagogy. 

Data Collection 

The theoretical framework of heuristic inquiry, a form of phenomenology, and a 
constructivist epistemology entwined to form a conceptual framework for the interpretation and 
analysis of the data collected about conceptual change in teacher thinking about teaching and 
learning in science. This qualitative study utilizing ethnographic methods (field notes, artifacts 
analysis, focus group discussions, and interviews) enabled the researcher to discover the essence 
of the conceptual change experiences of the individual participants. The descriptive data from 
interviews, focus group discussions, and personal journals depicted the lived experiences of the 
practicing teachers and were interpreted from the perspective of the investigator. 

The methodology of heuristic research enabled the researcher to generate an interpretation 
for the essence of the conceptual change experience of the individual participants in the study. “In 
heuristics, an unshakable connection exists between what is out there, in its appearance and reality, 
and what is within me in reflective thought, feeling, and awareness” (Moustakas, 1990, p. 12). 
This heuristic work was created from my self-search and self-dialogue relating to appropriate 
pedagogy for the teaching and learning of elementary school science and was united with the 



reflections of the participants in the study to interpret volitional changes in our collective thinking 
about the practice of conceptual change teaching. 

Research Questions 

Moustakas (1990) describes the formulation of the research question in this way. “All 
heuristic inquiry begins with the internal search to discover with an encompassing puzzlement, a 
passionate desire to know, a devotion and commitment to pursue a question that is strongly 
connected to one’s own identity and selfhood” (p. 40). 

The original, overarching research question gets the researcher started and helps the 
researcher stay focused throughout the research project. The overarching question for this study 
was: 

• What are the changes in the meanings, thoughts, and beliefs of elementary school science 
teachers about science pedagogy via a Generative Learning Model of teaching? 

The research questions define how the data is collected and analyzed. They also describe 
relationships sought, facts discovered, or concepts generated (LeCompte & Preissle, 1993). 
Related questions seek to identify and to clarify the research purpose. Related research questions 
were: 

• In what ways do elementary teachers change their conceptions about how to teach science? 

• Does a conceptual change in the elementary teachers' ideas about science teaching precede the 
ability to affect conceptual change in students' ideas about science? 

• Can elementary science teachers apply their reflections about conceptual conflict to pedagogical 
practices in the classroom? 

A methodology stemming from a qualitative tradition was selected to interpret the thoughts, 
meanings, and beliefs of the participants in the study. The interpretive research sought to 
investigate the invisibility of teachers’ thoughts and to document their meanings (Erickson, 1986) 
for the details of change in the practice of teaching science. The theoretical framework of heuristic 
inquiry (Moustakas, 1990) and the epistemology of constructivism (Bartlett, 1932; Piaget, 1963; 



O 

ERIC 



486 



509 



Vygotsky, 1978; Bruner, 1986; & Fosnot, 1989) guided the collection and the analysis of the data. 
Heuristic inquiry and constructivism formed the conceptual framework through which the 
assertions were generated. The yearlong study included three phases of research (see Table 1).

Two sites were selected for the study by accessibility and by convenience. Both sites were 
elementary schools in northwestern Pennsylvania. The superintendents of the sites gave 
permission for participation of the teachers in the districts and the principals of the elementary 
schools arranged for a presentation about the project at a faculty meeting. The proposed strategy 
for this study was to include all volunteers who agreed to participate. Four teachers volunteered 
from one site and five teachers volunteered from the second site. All were selected to participate. 
Shortly after the study began one of the teachers broke her leg and could not continue. 

Three workshops were designed and developed to introduce, present, and involve the 
participants in experiences with the GLM of teaching. The setting for the workshops and the 
format of the presentation for the workshops were critical to the development of the desired 
classroom environment for the teaching of science. The site for the workshops was a central 
location for the teachers from both school districts. The director of a state-funded science teacher 
education program offered the use of the program’s facilities. A classroom with comfortable 
chairs, an office staff that was helpful and attentive to our needs, and a library of curricular 
materials made this site a nonthreatening, relaxed, and accommodating environment for the 
presentation of the workshops. The workshops were held on three school days about once a 
month over a three month period. 




488 



Funding for the substitute teachers on the days the workshops were held was accepted 
from a variety of sources. One of the superintendents offered to fund the substitute teachers from 
his school district for one workshop. The director of the state science teacher education program 
funded substitute teachers for two workshops and the researcher funded the substitute teachers 
from one district for one workshop. An honorarium was offered to the presenter who attended 
Workshop One by the state science teacher education program. Lunch was provided by the 
researcher on all three workshop days. 

Technique of Analysis 

The qualitative methods in this study consisted of three kinds of data collection: (a) in- 
depth, one-on-one, open-ended interviews, (b) focus group discussions, and (c) written 
documents. Through the use of multiple methods of data collection including interviews, 
observations during workshop sessions, and document analyses, a mix of components were 
available for triangulation. LeCompte and Preissle (1993) describe triangulation as the means the 
ethnographer uses to pinpoint the accuracy of conclusions drawn during data analysis. 
Triangulation prevents the researcher from accepting initial impressions too readily. Miles and 
Huberman (1984) describe triangulation as a state of mind. “If you self-consciously set out to 
collect and double-check findings, using multiple sources and modes of evidence, the verification 
process will largely be built into the data-gathering process, and little more need be done than to 
report on one’s procedures” (p. 235). 

Moustakas ( 1990) suggests that a typical way of gathering material in a heuristic 
investigation is “through extended interviews that often take the form of dialogues with oneself and 
one’s research participants” (p. 46). The dialogues in this study involved cooperative sharing, 
comprehensive conversations, and open honesty. In-depth interviews involved personal, 
interactive conversations with the participants. The interviews were held at the convenience of the 
teachers, usually before or after school, and were audio taped and transcribed.

The initial interviews for the participants were held at the beginning of the school year at the 
respective school sites. The researcher inquired about the teachers’ lives inside and apart from 
school and about their educational backgrounds. The researcher asked each teacher to describe his 
or her beliefs, methodologies, and experiences as an elementary teacher of science. The interviews 
were intended to be open, flexible, and empathetic. The final interviews were conducted at the end 
of the school year at the school sites. The teachers described their conceptions about science 
pedagogy after the yearlong research project. The responses about their thinking and actions 
connected to the GLM were rich, vivid, and extensive. 

Focus group discussions were held at two of the teacher workshops. Bers (1989) defines a 
focus group as “a small (6-12 member), relatively homogeneous group that meets with a trained 
moderator who facilitates a 90-to 120-minute discussion in a nonthreatening, relaxed environment 
about a selected topic” (p. 261). The discussions generated interactions among the teachers 
eliciting the rich, deep data inherent in the synergy of small groups. The output from the 
discussions provided a voice for the participants. 

New thought was stimulated in part because of the safety in “groups of like kind” 
(Lederman, 1990, p. 120). The homogeneity of the group along with the vis-^-vis context 
generated ideas, provided feedback, and awakened conversations. The focus group discussions 
were about one and a half hours in length. The discussions were tape-recorded and transcribed. 

Additional meaning and depth to supplement the co-researchers’ depictions were obtained 
in the form of personal documents. The participants constructed personal diaries at the first teacher 
workshop. The teachers wrote in the personal, reflective journals throughout the school year. The 
entries offered additional meanings of their experiences and thoughts. The researcher also wrote 
field notes in her personal journal during the focus group discussions and during the peer teaching 
experiences. (See Table 3.)

Analytic Process of Phenomenological Analysis 

Heuristic inquiry involves a specialized, analytic process of phenomenological analysis. 
Moustakas (1990) describes five basic phases in the heuristic process of phenomenological 
analysis: immersion, incubation, illumination, explication, and creative synthesis. First, the 
researcher becomes totally involved in the world of the experience. Next, the researcher 



O 

ERIC 



491 



514 



withdraws to permit meaning and awareness to allow space for understanding. Then as 
understanding grows, themes and patterns emerge forming clusters. The researcher then refines 
the emergent patterns to unfold new connections. Finally, the researcher is ready to communicate 
the findings in a creative, meaningful way emphasizing her own personal experiences and insights 
surrounding the phenomenon studied. 

The immersion process for me began a four-month agenda of data analysis. I began by 
transcribing the interview and focus group discussion tapes. Next, I read and reread the interview 
and focus group discussion transcriptions. I also read and reread the personal journal entries. I 
developed a portrait of each participant’s experience and wrote a case record for each teacher. 

After this intense immersion with the data, I retreated from the data analysis for a period of time. 
This internal incubation period allowed my intuitions and tacit thoughts to clarify and extend the 
meaning of the data. 

The illumination process allowed me to reexamine the original data of the co-researchers 
and to reflect about my awareness of my discoveries. I rechecked the depictions of each participant 
and looked for omitted or deleted dimensions of their experiences. 

After the emerging themes and patterns were illuminated, I entered the process of 
explication. I reexamined and refined my own feelings and beliefs and looked again for 
understanding from the co-researchers’ perspectives. After explicating the core meanings and 
themes from the data analysis of the conceptual change experiences of the research participants, I 
shared the composite depiction with the participating teachers. 

In heuristic investigations, verification is enhanced by returning to the research participants, 
sharing with them the meanings and essences of the phenomenon as derived from reflection 
on and analysis of the verbatim transcribed interviews and other material, and seeking their 
assessment for comprehensiveness and accuracy. (Moustakas, 1990, p. 34) 

I asked the participants to affirm the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the verbatim 
transcriptions recorded during the interviews and the focus group discussion. My interpretations 
of their thoughts, meanings, and beliefs about science pedagogy were shared with the participants 



ERjt 



492 



515 



and I made inquiries about the fit between my depiction of their experiences and the data from 
which the depiction was developed. The verification process assisted me in portraying and 
capturing the essence of the teachers’ experiences and validated the participants’ meanings of 
conceptual change. 

All of the teachers affirmed my interpretations of their conceptual changes about science 
pedagogy after checking and judging the creative synthesis of the themes and assertions. The 
participants verified my analysis of their thoughts, meanings, and beliefs and they openly 
discussed the subjective nature of my depictions from the perspective of a co-researcher. 

During creative synthesis, the final phase of heuristic research, the researcher develops “an 
aesthetic rendition of the themes and essential meanings of the phenomena investigated” 
(Moustakas, 1990, p. 52). The interpretive work expresses and depicts the passionate, personal 
stories of teacher change related to my internal frame of reference and connects the depictions to a 
particular world view of the conceptual change process. 

This judgment is made by the primary researcher, who is the only person in the 
investigation who has undergone the heuristic inquiry from the beginning formulation of 
the question through phases of incubation, illumination, explication, and creative synthesis 
not only with himself or herself, but with each and every co-researcher. (Moustakas, 1990, 
p. 32) 

A Composite Depiction 

Five core themes were derived from the individual depictions. ‘The composite depiction 
includes all of the core meanings of the phenomenon as experienced by the individual participants” 
(Moustakas, 1990, p. 52). The five core themes are: teaching and learning in science, teachers as 
adult learners, the Generative Learning Model of teaching, teacher thinking, and conceptual 
change. The following group depiction reflects the experiences of individual participants through 
verbatim excerpts, exemplary narratives, descriptive accounts, and conversations “that accentuate 
the flow, spirit, and life inherent in the experience” (Moustakas, 1990, p. 52).

Assertions: The Creative Synthesis 



The assertions were generated from the study of practicing teachers’ thoughts, meanings, 
and beliefs about conceptual changes in science pedagogy. The assertions emerged through the 
researcher’s awareness of the essences and meanings of the participants through the processes of 
immersion, illumination, elucidation, and analysis of the data investigated. The following is a 
synthesis of each core theme interpreted from the creative synthesis of the themes and meanings of 
the conceptual change experiences. 

Teaching and Learning in Science 

The initial interviews with the teachers revealed their thoughts, meanings, and beliefs about 
teaching and learning in science. To study a change in perceptions about science pedagogy, it was 
important forme to establish the current beliefs and meanings of the participants in the study at the 
beginning of the academic year. The teachers’ beliefs were affected by perceived barriers to 
change in science teaching. The barriers to change described by the teachers are summarized in 
Table 4.

The participants expressed concerns about time, resources, lack of content knowledge, 
textbook driven curriculum, and top-down management of schools. 

Elizabeth 

I’m finding teaching so many more subjects ... I feel I’m almost being spread so thinly 
that it’s worrying me. I have. I’m responsible now for, of course, English, and reading 
and spelling and handwriting and math and science. And to prepare to get all of my 
materials out and ready for my afternoon classes of science is difficult. When I only had 
math and science, I could think more about the preparation of for the science labs and the 
science activities. So that does worry me a little bit.... I’m frustrated in the fact that a lot of 
times teaching science costs a lot of money. (Elizabeth, Initial Interview) 

Nancy 

Teachers in elementary classrooms need more background help. Biggest problem- 
background information. (Nancy, Journal Entry) 

Chris 

I look at our manual and I pick out of it what I want to teach. I do follow their content but 
what I usually try to do is start out with an activity, do some content, finish up with some 
type of activity. (Chris, Initial Interview) 

Eileen 

Regardless of what people say, I still think we’re still lock step, isolation, last week we had 
our board members come in and observe. What do board member expect to see? They 
expect to see children sitting in their seats quietly. (Eileen, Final Interview) 

Assertion 2: Perceived models of teaching science are barriers to change in science 
pedagogy. 

The participants described their current teaching practices in science through their 
depictions of science teaching models and examples of classroom practices. The co-researchers 
exemplified their beliefs about science teaching through the descriptions of the models they used to 
teach science (see Table 5).

When teachers in the study were asked to describe their teachingand to give an example of 
teaching and learning in science in their classrooms, the participants used many different models in 
the descriptions. The teaching model or method was often used as a context for explaining and 
depicting the personal practice of teaching science in the classroom. 

Nancy 

We’ve used these charts where we list what we know, we list what we want to know, and 
then we go back at the end and list what we learned. (Nancy, Initial Interview) 

Chris 

I think of it as the learning cycle. (Chris, Initial Interview) 

Cathy

steps.. .Usually I use the subject matter that we’ve taught (for testing) and you know if you 
want to call it a lecture. (Cathy, Initial Interview)

Eileen 



I would say I would have more of a tendency to be more of an active hands-on type person 
when it comes to science. (Eileen, Initial Interview) 

Nancy 

What Mrs. Dell and I have done in second grade is try to integrate it in with our reading. 
We try to do a lot more integrating with the social studies and science because we find that 
it always seems to get left out because we spend so much time on reading and math as 
being two major things. So if we sneak a little more in under other names we do. (Nancy, 
Initial Interview) 

Ian 

I always start with the same kind of introduction. The classic, not really classic, but just my 
way . . . more traditional where you start with a bulletin board and you talk about the 
obvious stages (of a frog) and the characteristics and then you end up with a worksheet or 
something . . . (Ian, Final Interview referring to initial practices) 

Teachers as Adult Learners 

The teachers in this study grew professionally as adult learners throughout the academic 
year. The staff development workshops removed the teachers from their isolated classrooms and 
set a climate for collaboration, reflection, and discussion. The participants greatly appreciated the 
opportunity to share, think, and engage in the construction of knowledge about science pedagogy. 

Assertion 1: The personal responses and the growth within the hearts and minds of 
elementary teachers about science pedagogy synthesize to become the “scientific soul” of the 
teacher. The scientific soul is the essence of the excitement, curiosity, and exploration of teaching 
and learning in science. 

Nancy 

I guess maybe the whole concept of the GLM model that you know, there is a model out 
there. There are things you can do. There are stages and that I actually had a chance to see 
the stages and participate in them, you know .... It opened me up to some ideas. 




497 520 



Because watching you take us through some of the steps as we were the participants and 
how many different ways a student could take a topic and question it as we had done, 
opened my eyes to, “gee, I really need more content here, more background.” (Nancy, 
Final Interview) 

Cathy 

I learned a lot about science even . . . with your experiments and your activities and things 
and now I’m excited to involve that. One thing I will say, too, I think that if you have a 
model that you kind of follow mentally, even if you don’t do it step-by-step, it avoids the 
problem of just doing hands-on just to do hands-on with no purpose ... so I think if you 
kind of follow the steps of the model, even mentally, even if you’re not doing each one, 
that it helps to have a purpose for the lesson, too, especially in science. Sometimes it’s 
fun, but you’ve got to be careful that you’re doing it with a motive. (Cathy, Final 
Interview) 

Assertion 2: Collaboration and cooperation in learning environments nurtures one’s 
scientific soul through continued personal growth and dialogue with others. 

The participants valued the opportunities to share ideas with the other participants in the 
workshop setting. The teachers collaborated about classroom strategies during workshop 
activities. The group focus discussions set aside time for the teachers to voice their opinions and 
ideas about the GLM and its function in the practice of teaching science in the elementary school 
classroom. The participants richly described their involvement in the three workshops. Their 
voices expressed appreciation and enthusiasm for professional development. 

Cathy 

I thought it was veiy, very valuable. I enjoyed it. I wish that all teachers, no matter how 
long they have been in the classroom, had the opportunity to do things. We’ve been crying 
for years to have days that we could observe other science classes, just other teachers, just 
like us, teaching the same subjects, but to get more ideas and a fresh approach. So I think 
anytime that you can work with your peers .... You know, even Ian and Susan in the

second grade ... we can go weeks and not see them except to pass them in the hall. So 
we have, sad to say, no idea what they have done maybe until we get the third graders and 
they say, “we did that in second grade,” you know. That’s very sad, but very true. So I 
think anytime you can pull professionals together to work and to learn from each other, I 
think it’s very valuable. (Cathy, Final Interview) 

Nancy 

You’re in one building and you see the people, I see certain people. I’m at the comer and 
there are always other people. I hardly ever see Elizabeth, you know. I pass her in the hall. 
So, I don’t know exactly all what goes on even in our own building, let alone what goes on 
in another building. So when you put a bunch of teachers together, the best thing to do is 
to let them talk because you’re going to find out that most schools are the same. They have 
the same problems and if you can get some new ideas how to work around things .... 
You know, it’s good to find out what’s going on. You don’t feel like you’re stuck in a 
room all by yourself. (Nancy, Final Interview) 

The collaborative spirit evident in the voices of the teachers impacted the personal and 
collegial growth of the individual participants. Each workshop session strengthened the peer 
relationships and encouraged peers to share ideas and expertise about teaching and learning in 
science and other curricular areas. An atmosphere of trust, respect, and comfort supported a spirit 
of risk taking and verified a helping social environment that eliminated feelings of isolation. 

The staff development workshops refreshed and revitalized the minds and spirits of the 
participating teachers. Their scientific souls were nourished by the excitement, enthusiasm, and 
warmth generated by the group for learning in science. The workshop opportunities introduced the 
participants to an innovation and supported the investigation and discussion surrounding its 
implementation and effectiveness. 




499 *5 22 



The GLM 



The initial interviews with the participants established a context for each teacher’s world of 
teaching science. Teaching models, the nature of learning, and curricular materials were 
components of the teachers’ perceptions of the context for teaching and learning science. 

Evidently, teachers’ beliefs and principles are contextually significant to the implementation 
of innovations, be they curricular, instructional, or in some other way the outgrowth of 

research and development in the world of science education If we are to understand 

how a teacher might deal with an innovation, then we must first understand his or her 
beliefs and principles. (Munby, 1984, p. 28). 

The GLM was the instructional innovation presented at the three staff development 
workshops. The innovation presented a dilemma for the participants. It challenged the teachers’ 
current ways of knowing about science teaching and learning and initiated new possibilities for a 
transformation from current perspectives to new meanings for science teaching. Each individual 
teacher viewed the GLM through his or her own personal perspective. 

None of the participants initially mentioned generative learning or the construction of ideas 
or knowledge as a principle of or a perception about teaching and learning in science. 

Osborne and Wittrock (1983) suggest that experienced teachers need opportunities to 
clarify the differences between children’s ideas, their own ideas, and the ideas of scientists. A 
suggestion for teacher education programs is “peer group discussions to clarify participants’ ideas 
with respect to each other, scientists, and children” (p. 502). 

The focus group discussions carried out at the second and third workshop sessions 
supported the researcher’s interpretations of the understanding and implementation of the GLM by 
the participants. Two assertions were generated by the participants about the GLM. 

Assertion 1: The GLM enfolds teachers in a conceptual change process related to the 
practice of teaching science. 



O 

ERIC 



500 



523 



Cathy 

Amazing what knowledge these children come to you with and that can even eliminate 
some things that you don’t have to cover that they already know. So I picked up on that 
more, a lot more, than I used to do. So, I’ve appreciated that. (Cathy, Final Interview) 
Assertion 2: The methodology of the GLM creates dissonance in the scientific souls of 
teachers about current practice and contributes to the conceptual change process by providing a 
context for the depiction of internally changed conceptions. 

Eileen 

If you were to go into a preschool room where you would see children tinkering, your first 
impulse is, well, you know, we’ve been so conditioned to sit down, fold your hands, and 
stop messing around. Well, maybe they’re just not always messing around. Maybe 
they’re beginning to wonder why. And I think perhaps with your more active students and 
maybe perhaps even with your more discipline problem students, this type of method 
would work very well because they’re engaged and they’re thinking. Where the 
conventional, structured classroom, which we are more in tune with, discourages this type 
of thing unless we are looking for it in ourselves. From what I’ve seen of the Generative 
Learning Model and what we have done, I think it’s a very worthwhile way of approaching 
science. (Eileen, Workshop 3) 

In this study, the researcher was the “consultant” or the change agent who presented the 
GLM in a series of three staff development workshops. Clark (1988) suggests that the consultant 
should be humble, sympathetic, and service-oriented. 

As the relationships between the researcher and the participants developed, the participants 
became less and less defensive about their former teaching practices. They felt comfortable with 
sharing ideas and methods to change the practice of teaching science in the elementary classroom. 

The learning process surrounding the innovation, the GLM, instigated a period of 
thoughtful questioning for the participants. They began to think about children’s ideas, productive 
questions, generative learning, constructivism, and science content. Their thinking and reflection 




sol 524 



about science teaching and learning aroused feelings of discontent with current practices and 
expressions of dissatisfaction regarding the conceptual learning within their students. The focus 
group discussion at the workshops provided the setting for voicing concerns and for sharing 
strengths with colleagues who were experiencing similar conceptual conflicts. 

Teacher Thinking 

In addition to the discussions about teaching strategies in a focus group, thinking aloud 
about teaching practices during interviews, and interacting with the researcher through dialogue, 
the participants in the study wrote reflections in journals. Russell et al. (1988) describe reflection 
and the role it plays in teacher thinking. 

While reflection may not be a conscious activity, we have seen that, when 
placed in a situation where reflection and discussion are encouraged and deliberate, most 
teachers have been enthusiastic about the opportunity this afforded them to think about their 
work and share concerns with an interested party, (p. 88) 

The participants kept personal journals throughout the process of learning about the GLM. 
They responded to their thoughts, meanings, and beliefs about the teaching and learning of science 
by writing reflections in their journals and by participating in focus group discussions. The 
reflections, written and voiced, documented the process of personal knowledge construction for 
each participant about science pedagogy. The newly constructed knowledge influenced the practice 
of teaching science in the classroom as described by the teachers in journals, interviews, and 
discussions. 

Assertion 1: Thinking about science teaching and learning occurs amidst reflections about 
conflicting beliefs and meanings for current practices. 

Eileen 

As I think in terms of our meetings, I was caught up in the enthusiasm that everyone 
showed for science and the exchanges that took place. I appreciated the flow of ideas and 

the views held by the other teachers I just found myself, when I wrote this, 

particularly toward the end, I just asked myself a question and put it in a question and tried 



0 

ERIC 



502 



525 



to think about it. One of the things that struck out in my mind ... I underlined it here just 
because a word means one thing to you doesn’t mean it means the same thing to 
everybody. And I think so many times in science and in education, are we really 
communicating? Are we really understanding what we’re trying to say? Is your version, is 
your thinking different from my thinking? We’re seeing the same thing, but we’re thinking 
different things. (Eileen, Journal Entry) 

Assertion 2: The personal, contemplative experiences of teachers authenticate teacher 
thinking about the value of classroom practice in the teaching and learning of science. 

As a result of their personal experiences with journal keeping and journal making, teachers 
began to implement science journals into classroom practice. The personal, thoughtful experiences 
of the teachers inspired them to support like experiences for their students. 

Chris 

And we’re doing “electric journals.” So after every activity, they have to write. It 
just could be three sentences, it could be five sentences, it could be a page. But 
they have to write why they think we did the activity, how it related to static 
electricity and then we usually take five minutes at the beginning of another class 
and they share what they had written about the other activity . . . and I just have to 
remember to give them time to do it sometimes. We, you know, checked it over the 
other day and everybody was up to where they were supposed to. We did five 

activities for static electricity I’ll probably do that more next year now that 

I’ve kind of got my feet wet on it a little bit and dabbled into that. I can see where a 
journal will definitely give me feedback from my students. And also, I think that if 
someone reads something and it’s way off key, I’ll know that, oh boy, that person 
doesn’t understand what we’re doing here. (Chris, Final Interview) 

Reflection, an internal characteristic of teacher thinking, and journal keeping, an external 
characteristic of teacher thinking, contributed to the participants’ conceptions about teaching and 
learning in science. The internal and external characteristics of teacher thinking about science 



teaching and learning began to convince the participants about the need for instructional strategies 
which diagnose students’ conceptions, ideas, and achievements in the science classroom. 

A constructivist view of reflective teaching asks the teacher to reorganize or reconstruct 
experiences that lead to new understandings. Schon (1988) describes reflective teaching as open to 
confusion and vulnerability. Reflective teaching parallels the disequilibrium or cognitive 
dissonance experienced by children during the Generative Learning Model of teaching. Reflections 
about purpose and meaning, if examined by responsible practitioners, influenced decisions about 
how to teach. As individual teachers consciously begin to reflect on the meanings of their 
experiences, they begin to challenge the customs of the education system and to challenge their 
own traditions of teaching. 

Conceptual Changes in Teacher Thinking 

The individual teachers’ voices and their written reflections documented the personal, 
conceptual change process for each participant. The rapport established between the researcher and 
the individual participants and the alliances formed among the teachers and with the researcher 
supported the investigation of the change process in teacher thinking about science pedagogy. The 
scientific souls of the researcher and the participants were openly shared and communally 
encountered through individual and group dialogues. 

Assertion 1: Change begins to occur inside the scientific soul of a teacher when current 
beliefs and meanings about practice are in disequilibrium and new beliefs and meanings for practice 
begin to make sense. 

Changes in methodology, meaning, atmosphere, and thinking influenced the practices of 
teaching science in the classroom of the participating teachers. As the teachers began to make 
sense of the Generative Learning Model of teaching and instruction for conceptual change, they 
began to change their conceptions about appropriate classroom practice.

I probably in all honesty, I probably would not have done that kind of approach without at 

least being exposed to that kind of thinking. I would have just opened the file and said.

“Ok, we did this and we did this and this and filmstrip number four and worksheet one, 
two, and three, worksheet four, five, and six.” Not quite as hard core as that . . .but not 
quite as open ended .... And it was interesting because the people that were in the room, I 
think I had mentioned to you, and the sub had a feeling of . . . this was exciting. I don’t 
know if exciting was the word. It was fun. (Ian, Final Interview) 

Each of the eight participants changed their conceptions about science teaching and learning 
in some way. Each individual came to the staff development workshops with a unique set of the 
beliefs and principles for the teaching and learning of elementary school science. Therefore, each 
participant’s meanings and thoughts changed in a particular way. The thoughts about pedagogy 
and methodology differed in some ways, but the perceptions of teaching and learning in science 
transformed to include new ways of knowing or making sense of teaching science. 

Assertion 2: Changes in the practice of teaching elementary school science are prefaced by 
a willful change of the conceptions within the scientific souls of teachers. 

The process of implementing changed conceptions into classroom practice is a complicated 
next step. “One can theorize with the best of intentions about how teaching and school learning 
could be optimized, but the finest ideas and proposals must still pass through the funnel of teacher 
planning” (Clark, 1988, p. 8). Clark describes the practice of teaching as cognitively demanding 
and complex. The teachers in the study began to envision their plans in science to include the 
thoughts and beliefs affirmed in conceptual change teaching. 

Elizabeth 

And I think where I need to work more on is what we’re doing here with what do you 
know? What do you need to know? Going back, I don’t. I think I’m too much of a 
dictator. What do / want to teach? All these neat ideas. I need to get into more of not 
being a dictator. More finding out what they already know and what they need to know 
and I think I am very weak in that area. I like coming to these things (workshops) and kind 
of keep injecting myself with this and keep bashing and say ... do this. I like that idea . . 

. . Well, I think that a lot of people, myself included, before I got into this with you, I was 





saying, “Yes, I do hands-on science” ... . Yes, I did. But, so what? I mean if I didn’t, 
sure, they were doing a lot of things but if I wasn’t having them apply it to see if they really 
understood the whole concept of what they were doing and ... I’m not saying I’m at that 
point yet. I mean. I’m still growing slowly with this. But I can see where that is the whole 
ball of wax. I mean that is what we really have to do. (Elizabeth, Final Interview) 
lan 

And that it has to start even before that. I have to change ... I mean it has to go back 
further than just the kids changing. I think it’s something that you . . . ultimately probably 
take time to really initiate on a wide scale. (Ian, Final Interview) 

Eileen 

And I suppose not only are we talking here about a conceptual change for the student, but 
as teachers, we have to undergo a conceptual change and try to influence those people who 
are in charge of inservicing, curriculum, and so forth, so a change does take place. 

(Eileen, Workshop 3) 

The teachers struggled with their changing conceptions about the teaching and learning of science 
in the elementary classroom. As the teachers interpreted personal meaning for conceptual change 
teaching and learning, the conceptual change process occurred within the “scientific souls” of the 
participants. Teaching and personal changes were intertwined as intensely passionate experiences 
for the participants. Each individual participant’s change process was a unique experience. The 
change experiences transformed the practice of teaching science to include newly constructed 
knowledge about teaching and learning in science. 

The emerging assertions from each of the five core themes interpreted the conceptual 
change experiences of the participants. The composite depiction of the group, through verbatim 
excepts of vivid, accurate, and clear qualities of the core themes, represented the experiences of the 
co-researchers. Individual reflection and experience with disequilibrium and cognitive dissonance 
about their familiar routines occurred during staff development workshops and amidst classroom 
activities and teaching. The struggles with individual conceptions about science teaching 




506 523 



assembled together represented the volitional changes in the minds and heart of the group from 
their experiences. The composite depiction of the group reflects volitional changes in the scientific 
souls of the participants. The core meanings about teaching and learning in science, adult learning, 
and teacher thinking voiced by the participants and interpreted by the researcher authenticate the 
volitional changes in the construction of conceptions about science pedagogy experienced by the 
research participants. 



The Researcher’s Scientific Soul 

Our roles as teachers are closer to those of negotiators than to puppeteers or engineers. And 
even when we succeed in shaping our students’ surfaces, unless we touch their souls we 
will be locked out of their inner lives. Much of contemporary education in both the public 
school and the university seldom gets more than skin deep. (Eisner, 1995, p.94) 

In my present role as a researcher and a university professor, I interpret Eisner’s quotation 
from the perspective of a teacher educator. School change and reform in science education will not 
happen unless we unlock the inner lives of teachers. Until we touch the scientific souls of 
prospective and practicing teachers, reform in science education will continue to be a goal, not a 
reality. 

The intent of the initial research plan was not to simulate the design of the GLM. My 
previously constructed knowledge about the GLM and my beliefs about meaningful learning that 
resulted from my work with the GLM impacted my work with the participating teachers. The 
relationship between the GLM and the events of the conceptual change process of the participants 
is paralleled in Table 6.

Self-direction, life experiences, reflection, and finally action expressing learning that has 
occurred are the constructs of a theory for teachers as adult learners. These elements viewed 
through the constructivist approach to learning built a conceptual framework for interpreting 
teacher learning and change. When the teachers experienced dissonance in their own thinking 
about how students learn best, reflected about those conflicting ideas inside their own heads, and 
then collaborated collectively with other teachers; they made an attempt at changing their practice. 
Facing and resolving conflict between old and new conceptions of teaching and learning facilitated 
making sense of classroom practice and promoted meaningful change for practicing teachers. 

Recommendations for Reform 

The complicated and interactive process of genuine reform in science education begins in 
the scientific souls of elementary school teachers. Aspects of educational practices affecting the 
hearts and minds of elementary school teachers include (a) structure and policy of school, (b) 
methodology of science instruction, and (c) teacher perceptions about science pedagogy. These 
dimensions of educational practice reflect the conditions for change in teachers’ conceptions of 




508 



teaching and learning science in the elementary school. When teachers are not given opportunities 
to address and to contribute to the policymaking process regarding educational practices within the 
structure of school, it becomes extremely difficult for schools to support the conditions for 
changing teachers’ conceptions about pedagogy. 

The structures and policies of elementary schools often constrain the growth of the 
teachers’ scientific souls. Time, resources, curricula based on the scope and sequence of science 
textbooks, and top-down management contribute to the success or failure of the reform process in 
science education. Structures, policies, and administrators are the components of school culture 
often in control of the decision making processes that are crucial to the reformation of science 
education. School leaders many times besiege elementary school teachers with policy changes, 
new techniques, one-shot inservice programs, and surface-level inspections of teaching 
performance. Reform in science education will not take place as a result of these approaches as 
past studies indicate. 

Until policymakers and school administrators recognize teachers as curriculum planners 
and implementers who are at the center of school culture, change in science education will not 
become a reality. School calendars, budgets, and inservice education opportunities can positively 
impact the change process in science education. Time and money for ongoing staff development 
workshops to support teachers as adult learners who question current practices, act as Socratic 
tutors for colleagues, and reconstruct knowledge about teaching and learning in science will 
support the conditions for conceptual change in teachers about science pedagogy. Changing 
school culture is not easy. When leaders and stakeholders recognize teachers’ conceptions about 
science pedagogy as a viable means for revolutionizing science education, reform begins. 

Changing meanings, thoughts, and beliefs to make sense of science pedagogy is not 
intelligible for elementary school teachers who are viewed as technicians and are inspected during 
the evaluation of their performances. The conceptual change process involves helping teachers 
generate appropriate meanings for science pedagogy. Recapturing meaning requires time for 
reflection about past experiences, collaboration with colleagues about dissatisfaction with current 



conceptions, and staff development workshops offering plausible alternatives for appropriate 
classroom instruction. 

Inciting curiosity in teachers as learners, creating cognitive conflict in teachers’ minds, and 
providing ongoing staff development workshops will bring about a fruitful reform process in 
science education. The stories of change told by the teachers who experienced the methodology of 
the GLM in this yearlong research project affirm the potential for volitional changes in the 
conceptual thinking of teachers about science pedagogy that will enhance and energize the reform 
process in science education. 

The formidable challenge of changing the nature of teaching and learning in elementary 
school science begins with the teachers themselves. Teachers become agents of change when they 
are given time and opportunity to reflect during dialogues with themselves and with others and to 
collaborate with colleagues about the creative process of changing conceptions of pedagogy. 

When the excitement and joy of teaching and learning in science awaken the scientific souls of 
elementary school teachers, they begin to reshape the practice of teaching elementary school 
science. The teachers’ newly constructed conceptions about science pedagogy verify and establish 
a framework for conceptual change in the teaching and learning of science in the elementary school 
classroom.

SUPPORTING COMMUNITIES OF LEARNERS IN URBAN 
SCHOOL DISTRICTS: EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THE 
URBAN SYSTEMIC INITIATIVE ON CLASSROOM PRACTICE 



Mary Stein, Wayne State University 
John Norman, Wayne State University 

As a result of an abundance of national and international reports on the science 
achievement of the nation’s youth (Jacobson & Doran, 1991; Mullins & Jenkins, 1988; 
National Commission on Excellence in Education, 1983), science educators are in the midst 
of large scale reform efforts. The challenges faced by urban schools as they aspire to 
reform science education are immense. Under the auspices of the National Science 
Foundation, through the Urban Systemic Initiative (USI), teachers and administrators 
throughout the Detroit Public School system have been deeply involved in a wide array of 
professional development activities. Researchers and professional developers in science 
education recognize that teachers and administrators are often bombarded with new ideas 
and are in need of sustained, high quality professional development (Haney & Lumpe, 
1995; Holmes, 1986, 1995; MAA, 1991; NCR, 1996; NCTM, 1989, 1991; Raizen & 
Miachelsohn, 1994; Shroyer, Wright, & Ramey-Gasser, 1996). Furthermore, the 
likelihood of professional development experiences positively impacting classroom 
teaching and learning will increase with the development of collegial support (Dlugosh, 
1993; Donivan, 1993; Keys and Golley, 1996; Ramirez-Smith, 1995; Sparks & Loucks- 
Horsley, 1990; Tippins, 1993; Weir, 1992). 

One of the first activities at the onset of the Detroit Urban Systemic Initiative 
(DUSI) involved creating a document which articulated some of the principles of teaching 
and learning that might ultimately improve student understanding and achievement. This 
document, A Constructivist Vision Towards Teaching, Learning, and Staff Development 
(Stein, et. al., 1994), has served to inform administrators, teachers and staff of the DUSI 
vision for improvement. A key challenge in large urban districts is to help all stakeholders 
understand and work toward common goals. This constructivist vision document has 
served as a template for professional developers and school teams as they plan for future 
activities. The nine principals outlined in the document are: 

• Each student must actively construct her or his own meaning in order to 
understand the material being learned. 



ERIC 



514 



537 



• Learning depends on the previous understandings that students bring to the 
learning situation. 

• What, and how much, is learned depends on the context in which it is learned. 

• What is learned depends on the shared understandings that students negotiate 
with the teacher and with each other. 

• Constructivist teaching involves meeting students "where they are" and helping 
them move to higher levels of knowledge and understanding. 

• Teachers can use specific teaching methods to facilitate student's active 
construction of knowledge. 

• In constructivist teaching, the teacher emphasizes "leaming-how-to-leam." 

• The constructivist teacher uses continuous assessment to facilitate learning. 

• Constructivist teachers are themselves constructivist learners. 

In order for DUSI reform efforts to succeed, it has not only been important for teachers to 
understand DUSI goals, but also for teachers to articulate their own ideas about teaching 
and learning and to think about changes that are needed for success. Several researchers 
support the idea that teacher beliefs are precursors to change and that the teacher is the 
crucial change agent in paving the way to reform (Ajzen & Fishbein, 1980; Crawley & 
Koballa, 1992; Cuban, 1979; Fullan & Miles, 1992; Jenlink, 1995). Additionally, some 
researchers have noted that previous attempts at science reform fell short of successful 
change because they were not systemic in nature and often embodied a top-down model of 
change (Anderson & Mitchener, 1994; Bybee & DeBoer, 1994; Cuban, 1990; Fullan & 
Miles, 1992; Gordon, 1993; Sashkin & Egermeirer, 1992). 

A key component of the Detroit Urban Systemic Initiative (DUSI) is a summer 
institute developed to target constructivist teaching and learning principles. During the 
institute, school teams of teachers and administrators were engaged in a variety of program 
activities designed to help them to understand constructivism and form supportive 
communities of learners as they discussed their understandings and developed future plans. 
It was thought that institute participants who were immersed in a constructivist 
environment, would have opportunities to confront their own beliefs about teaching and 
learning and implement changes at the classroom and school levels (Deighan, 1992). 
Furthermore, the institute was designed to encourage collaboration, the sharing of ideas, 
and the development of teacher support systems. It is believed that teacher belief systems 





515 



are significant factors in motivating a change in teaching behavior and that previous reform 
efforts largely ignored the influential nature of teacher beliefs on changes in teaching 
practice (Tobin, Tippins, & Gallard, 1994). 

A study by Haney, Czemiak, and Lumpe (1996) further articulated the importance 
of teacher beliefs on changes in practice: 



In other words, teacher perceived outcomes regarding the behavior at hand and the 
likelihood that these outcomes will occur to be major influences on behavioral 
intention; therefore, contemporary reform cannot afford to ignore the importance of 
such beliefs. . . . The obstacles and enablers that the teachers were provided 
mattered less to them than did their beliefs about the positive and negative outcomes 
associated with the behavior. This finding suggests that teacher training should pay 
particular attention to the attitudes teachers have toward behavior before alterations 
of control factors (such as providing curriculum materials, reducing class size, 
including flexible class scheduling, etc.) are expected to lead to lasting changes in 
classroom practice, (p. 985) 

Although targeting teacher belief systems may be viewed as critical to change, there 
are many other obstacles that may impede progress. Sparks (1994) made recommendations 
for effective, sustained, high quality staff development. The developers of the summer 
institute sought to adhere to these recommendations. Among the recommendations that 
were interwoven into the design and format of the institute were: 



• Keep the focus on student learning. 

• Recognize that change affects staff members in personal ways. 

• Change the organization’s culture at the same time that individual teachers and 
administrators are acquiring new knowledge and skills. 

• Use a systems approach to change. 

• Apply what is known about the change process to the improvement effort. 

• Recognize the subtle tension between the importance of establishing readiness 
for change and the need to get people to try out new practices. 

• Provide content-specific staff development that addresses both deeper forms of 
content knowledge and instructional strategies most effective in that discipline. 

• Make certain that learning processes for teachers model the type of instruction 
that is desired. 





516 



• Provide generous amounts of time for collaborative work and various learning 
activities. 



Description of the Program 

As part of the Detroit Urban Systemic Initiative (DUSI), a massive professional 
development institute was held during July, 1995 and 1996. The institute, Building 
Communities of Learners for Mathematics and Science Literacy, attracted over 1300 
applicants each year. The goal of the institute was to foster school-based peer support as 
school teams worked together to improve the mathematics and science programs offered to 
students. A constructivist orientation was central to the institute design. The institute was 
able to accept over 700 participants in 1995 and 800 participants in 1996. The participants 
were comprised of school teams of mathematics and science teachers and administrators 
across grade levels (K-12). 

Presenters at the summer institute represented many different universities, 
institutions, and organizations. Nationally known programs and presenters with national 
reputations were strong components of the institute. Many of these experts were asked to 
act as consultants at the institute because their work has been highly regarded in the field. 
Most of these experts had previously worked with the district and continue to do so. A 
unique aspect of the institute was to have so many constituencies working together for a 
sustained period towards a common goal. 

The needs of individual school teams and individual participants varied greatly. 
Therefore, the program sought to offer participants the opportunity to immerse themselves 
in a variety of areas. Throughout each day of the institute, participants were involved in 
four major activities: focus sessions, a keynote address, workshops, and school team 
meetings. These components of the institute targeted a variety of topics including the 
following: technology, alternative assessment, cooperative learning, multicultural 
mathematics and science, Family Math and Science, and specific content workshops related 
to the Detroit Public School Core Curriculum. The Core Curriculum in aligned with 
Michigan State and National Standards. 

The morning focus sessions provided participants with the opportunity to study one 
area of interest for the entire week of the institute (with the same participant group and 
instructor). The focus sessions were followed by the keynote address, during which all 

517 

540 




institute attendees came together to hear a common message delivered by a speaker of 
national prominence. Afternoon workshops provided participants an opportunity to 
explore areas of interest outside of their focus session topics. Finally, each day concluded 
with school team meetings during which participants discussed what they were learning 
and made plans for changes during the coming school year. 

While participant programming was varied to meet individual needs, the focus of 
the institute was on constructivist approaches to learning and teaching. During the institute, 
school teams read and discussed the DUSI vision document, A Constructivist Vision 
Towards Teaching, Learning, and Staff Development (Stein, et. al., 1994). Presenters 
were also asked to familiarize themselves with this document and to consider how their 
sessions model and inform principles of constructivism. School teams were encouraged to 
connect what they were learning through focus sessions, keynote addresses, and 
workshops to the principles of constructivist teaching that are outlined in this document. It 
was believed that this alignment of activities would help to further DUSI goals. During the 
institute, school teams were asked to work together to create a "Team Action Plain" 
(Appendix A) which would detail goals and implementation plans for their science and 
mathematics programs for the 1995-96 school year. Each school team submitted a team 
action plan at the end of the institute. 



Methods 



Several types of data were collected to examine the impact of the summer institute 
activities on institute participants. At the conclusion of the institute, a survey was 
administered to evaluate the effectiveness of each of the program components. The “Team 
Action Plans” developed by each school team participating at the institute were also utilized 
as a data source. Many school teams also provided brief reports that served to update the 
institute coordinators on the progress the team was making toward implementing their 
action plans and achieving their goals. Finally, as part of the overall Detroit Urban 
Systemic Initiative Evaluation, eight case studies of school teams who had attended the 
institute were conducted. As part of the case studies, semi-structured interviews were 
conducted with each school team. Institute surveys and interview transcripts served as the 
primary data sources. 

A survey was administered to all institute participants at the end of the summer 
institute. Participants were told not to identify themselves on the survey. The survey 



utilized a five point Likert Scale with a rating of “1” indicating “Strongly Agree” and a 
positive response while a rating of “5” indicated “Strongly Disagree” and a negative 
response. All items were positively phrased. 

To obtain information on the quality and nature of the changes reported by school 
teams, eight school teams were selected for in-depth study. The schools were selected to 
mirror important characteristics of the summer institute teams. The majority of summer 
institute participants were elementary level educators. Thus, five of the eight case study 
schools were at the elementary level, with two case study schools each at the middle and 
high school levels. Each of the school teams had articulated changes that were occurring at 
their schools through interim reports. 

The primary objective of gathering data through case studies of selected school 
teams was to obtain detailed evidence regarding the extent of the quality of change in the 
science and mathematics program as a result of the implementation of the team plan. 
Additionally, the researchers wanted to document obstacles or barriers encountered by the 
team and how they were resolved. 

Science and mathematics educators from Wayne State University conducted the 
case studies. These researchers were familiar with the summer institute goals, the Team 
Action Plans, and the DUSI Constructivist Vision Document. Each researcher visited the 
school sites, held discussions with administrators and teachers, and made classroom 
observations. A semi-structured interview with school team participants focused on 
implementation of the Team Action Plan (Appendix B). 

The methods employed in the case studies were interpretive (Erickson, 1986). 
Sources of data were transcripts of eight in-depth, semi-structured interviews of 
approximately one hour duration each and field notes of lesson observations, informal 
conversations, and observations of student work. The use of multiple data sources helped 
enhance the credibility of findings. Lincoln and Guba (1985) indicated that the use of 
multiple data sources in data analysis, called triangulation, allows the researcher to test 
emerging assertions against the entire data set to confirm or refute those assertions. 
Compatible with the type of data yielded by interpretive case studies, inductive analysis 
(Bogdan & Bicklen, 1992; Marshall & Rossman, 1989; Merrieam, 1988) was the primary 
method for analyzing the data. That is, the data were repeatedly examined to uncover 
salient patterns, singularities, and themes. Emergent relationships and assertions (or 




519 542 



working hypotheses) were then generated. These assertions were tested for validity against 
the entire data set and reformulated as the analysis developed. 

Results 



At the end of each institute, a survey was administered to institute participants. The 
survey results are shown in Table 1. The results indicated that institute participants 
believed that the institute was very worthwhile and that their was a strong likelihood that 
the Team Action Plans developed at the institute would be implemented during the 
following school year. Survey results also indicated that participants believed that they 
understood constructivism much better as a result of their participation at the institute. The 
survey also demonstrated the perceived benefit of planning team meeting time into the 
program. Survey results indicated that participants believed that team meeting time provided 
during the daily program was beneficial and helped school teams with future planning. 
Furthermore, results also indicated that the team meeting time helped individuals think 
about components of constructivism. 

Evidence from the case study reports indicates that as a result of institute activities 
there appears to be a greater emphasis on hands-on instructional approaches, integrating 
technology into programs, increasing parental involvement, instituting more cooperative 
learning, increasing the depth of understanding in content areas, and using a variety of 
assessment strategies to inform instruction. The case study reports delineate the school 
curriculum changes planned by the various teams, namely: 

• School A focused on increasing students' understanding of estimation and 
measurement concepts; 

• School B focused on increasing parental involvement; 

• School C School focused on alternative assessment, technology and parental 
involvement; 

• School D focused on increasing parental involvement, problem solving, self 
assessment, cooperative learning, and infusing technology; 



• School E focused on shifting to more child-centered approaches to instruction 
and attending to issues of equity in mathematics and science; 

• School F focused primarily on parental involvement and an increase in active 
learning strategies; 

• School G focused on cooperative learning, the infusion of technology and 
increasing hands-on activity; 

• School H focused on implementing the Core Curriculum and utilizing 
alternative assessment strategies. 

These activities mirror many of the components found in the constructivist vision 
document as well as the initial action plans formulated by the teams. Interview transcripts 
supported the impact of the summer institute on various components of constructivist 
teaching and learning. The teaching and learning changes taking place that were most 
evident along with selected supporting data are found below. 



Comments that suggested active, student-centered teaching and learning activities included: 



One way that [constructivism in the team action plan] has been reflected is that we 
have put a greater emphasis in math and science on manipulatives. In science, we 
see teachers doing less reading of the textbooks and more investigation. 

The summer institute really helped me to focus on giving the kids hands-on things 
to do, to inspire them to learn, to involve them in their learning and it demonstrated 
to me that this moves kids to higher levels of learning. When the children put their 
hands-on something, build something, construct something, they're actively 
involved in learning. That's when learning takes place. Being a new teacher it 
really helped me. It really helped me get a handle on and to focus on what I ought 
to be about the business of doing. How I really ought to direct the children and 
how I ought to facilitate their learning. Being a facilitator of learning, rather than 
lecturing from the book. 

Comments that suggested increased parental involvement included: 



One of the things that happened, that was just fantastic was the Family 
carnival... Students started showing their parents how to do it [a graphing activity]. 
I think this is wonderful because it lets the parents see that 'Yes- my child is 
involved in school and I can help my child out at home.' That was a result of the 
summer institute that directly impacted this school. 




521 544 



I think parents are more excited about what's going on in our classrooms - what 
kids are learning and how they’re learning. 



Comments that suggested emphasis on student achievement in mathematics and science 
included: 



I wanted to show you that we have had a tremendous increase in our MEAP math 
scores this year [shows newsletter report]. We are involved in the Metropolitan 
Achievement Testing right now. And I think we will see some significant 
improvement in scores because of all the hard work. 



Comments that suggested cooperative and collaborative teaching strategies included: 



In my case, its a completely different approach [to teaching]. ..I use technology the 
best I can in order to get the kids to start their own learning by involving them. I'm 
not sure how much learning is taking place, that will come later, but I know 
everybody is involved because they all have to be involved. Not just through the 
pressure of my direction, but the peer pressure of being involved like everybody 
else. So you get more activity. And sometimes somebody else might come in and 
think it's noise, but it's not noise. I don't have much of that, For the most part if 
the noise is constructive and moving towards the objective, then it's doing what 
you want it to do. In my case that is a big change. 



Comments that highlighted the importance of professional collaboration included: 



Team planning is excellent in this building. Everybody puts their heads together 
and thinks about what is we need to do and then they go ahead and do it. 

A lot of times [the principal] has the vision and then we work together to make it 
happen. Most of the time her visions are good. A leader with a vision is most 
important. 

The week before school opened we had a five day workshop with our teachers. 

One of the days, the team members who attended the institute presented all of the 
materials that we received. And we made copies. So even though most of our staff 
did not attend the institute, that information was disseminated. 



Survey and case study results indicate that the summer institute may have helped 
participants implement changes at individual, classroom, and school levels. While the case 
studies provide information on only a small sample of schools, the results indicate that it is 
possible that even when school level changes are not evident, individual participants may 
still be profoundly affected and begin the change process on a personal level. This was 
evident in candid interview comments as shown in the example below: 





522 



In my classroom I think it's student activity - the student interaction. It's the 
biggest change in my room. I guess that change came from me. I didn't see the 
value of it too much before because I thought it was noise. I didn't think noise was 
productive. But I think different now from the workshop I went to. I talked with 
some of my colleagues, and watched what they do, and then I started...I think that 
was the biggest change for me - getting the students involved in their own learning. 

Summary and Conclusions 

The results of this study indicate that the Summer Institute program has had some 
very positive impacts on the ways educators provided science and mathematics instruction 
to their students. Key components of the institute that enabled this success were: 

• adherence to an articulated, shared vision which permeated program activities; 

• a variety of sessions designed to meet a diversity of individual and school needs; 

• effective consultants who modeled constructivism in their presentations; 

• teams composed of teachers and administrators who would support the team action 
plans 

• a focus on student learning outcomes; 

• time for school team sharing and planning built into the program. 

Time for participants to share and plan for the future was a critical component of the 
institute. The Team Action Plans served to remind the teams of their goals and the activities 
that would be needed to reach these goals. Each school team might be viewed as a 
“learning community” where team members shared their views and formulated plans 
together. At the same time, other kinds of learning communities also seemed to emerge 
through the selection of specific morning focus sessions. 

Many urban, state, and national reform efforts are looking for ways to scale up to 
meet current professional development needs. The challenges faced by urban schools as 
they aspire to reform science education are immense. At the same time, there is a need to 
develop collegial support at the building level in order for reform to take place. The format 
of the DUSI summer institute targets and supports these two objectives and may serve to 
provide other staff developers with ideas to support their efforts.

SYSTEMIC REFORM EVALUATION : 

GENDER DIFFERENCES IN STUDENT ATTITUDES TOWARD SCIENCE AND 
MATHEMATICS 

Kunimitsu Kanai, Wayne State university 
Dr. John Norman, Wayne State university 

Background Information 

In 1994, a large urban school district embarked on a systemic reform effort for its science 
and mathematics programs. This reform effort collaboratively involved all aspects of the 
community including teachers, students, administrators, parents, university science and 
mathematics educators, scientists, and community/industry representatives. A constructivist 
vision statement was initially developed to guide this change process. It essentially stated that 
constructivism leads to new beliefs about excellence in teaching and learning and discussedlhe 
roles of both teachers and students in the process. Furthermore, in constructivist classrooms 
students are active rather than passive; teachers are facilitators of learning rather than transmitters 
of knowledge. 

Both formative and summative evaluations were undertaken each year to inform leaders 
and teachers about progress and needs. A combination of data collection techniques were used: 
achievement tests, teacher surveys, student surveys, case studies, focus groups, and observations 
of staff development sessions. 

Problem 

One of the underlying emphases of this systemic reform effort was that of gender equity. 
That is, all students should be encouraged to leam science and mathematics in every year of their 
schooling from elementary school through high school. Furthermore, all students should be 
encouraged to contribute to class activities in science and mathematics — cooperative learning 
methods were encouraged. Teachers were asked to develop and use practices that fostered equity 



in the classroom. Staff development activities over a two-year period emphasized ideas and 
modeled techniques for better achieving equity in learning. 

Purpose 

The primary purpose of this study was to gather baseline data on gender differences in 
student attitudes toward science and mathematics as a part of Systemic Reform Evaluation and to 
see whether this systemic reform effort had enhanced student attitudes toward science and 
mathematics for both boys and girls. This data will be useful as formative evaluation for 
curriculum leaders and other supporting personnel involved in this reform effort. Based on this 
data, changes can be made in the inservice and preservice program for teachers and in other 
aspects of the science and mathematics program. Knowledge of possible gender differences in 
student attitudes toward science and mathematics can assist teachers in their mission to help"each 
child become a more capable learner. Furthermore, future evaluators of student attitudes can use 
this baseline data for determining if progress has been made in the systemic initiative on 
achieving gender equity. 

Review of the Related Literature

Overview 

Historically, research on science education has focused on specific educational outcomes. 
Until about twenty years ago, the major focus of this research was on educational objectives in 
the cognitive domain. Recently, the affective domain, as defined by Krathwohl, Bloom, and 
Masia (1964), has not only been accepted as a relevant part of education, but has also become the 
focus of considerable research. One of the key variables within the affective domain that has 
drawn attention is attitudes. 

The relatively low number of women in scientific professions has become a national 
concern. It has been proposed that the attitude of girls toward science is one factor that 



533 



influences the decision of girls to participate in science as well as their achievement in science. 
This concern has resulted in a variety of studies designed to identify gender differences that may 
effect the number of girls in the scientific pipeline (Oakes, 1990). 

Some observers have suggested that gender inequality is no longer an issue in education 
because gender differences in educational achievement have declined considerably over the past 
decade (Archer & McDonald, 1991; Friedman, 1989; Marsh, 1989; Viaredo, 1991). Wilder and 
Powel (1989), in “ETS Policy Notes”, suggested performance differences may be slowly 
diminishing, although women still lag in some aspects of spatial ability and achievement at the 
top levels of mathematics. 

However, Catsambis (1995), using data from a large, nationally representative sample of 
approximately 1,052 schools and 24,500 eighth grade students, suggested that the decline of 
gender differences in achievement may not be sufficient to ensure the increased participation of 
women in scientific and technical fields. Catsambis found that, in the middle grades, girls do not 
lag behind their male classmates in science achievements tests, grades, and course enrollments; 
however, twice as many boys as girls reported science career aspirations and positive attitudes 
toward this subject even among students of similar levels of achievement. The American 
Association of University Women (AAUW) (1992) carried out a survey of 3,000 fourth through 
tenth grades students, girls and boys from across the country (12 locations nationwide), in order 
to examine the impact of gender on self-esteem levels, career aspirations, educational 
experiences, and math-science interests. AAUW found similar results as Catsambis, although 
girls received equal or even better grades in science and mathematics courses. However, as girls 
grew older, they lost confidence in their abilities, and showed less interest in these subjects than 
boys in high school. Baker (1983) also found girls to have more negative attitudes toward 
science than boys, but still to have higher science grades. 



Gender differences in scientific and technical careers are, therefore, largely due to 
attitudes and choices of a science-related careers and not so much due to levels of achievement. 
Catsambis reasonably concluded that gender differences will continue to persist in our nation’s 
scientific pipeline because of the importance of early commitment to scientific and technical 
fields. 

Gender Differences in Attitudes Toward Science and Mathematics 

There are numerous researchers who found that, particularly in the U.S., boys held more 
positive attitudes toward science than do girls (Czemiak & Chiarelott, 1984; Kahle, 1983; Kurth, 
1987). Lowery, Bowyer, and Padillia (1980), in their experimental study, reported that boys 
showed more positive attitudes toward science than girls in both the control and the experimental 
groups. Kahle (1984) reported that data from the National Assessment of Educational 
Performance (NAEP) had indicated that 13- and 17- year-old girls had strong negative attitudes 
toward science and had little belief that the discipline could be useful to them. Likewise, 
Zimmerer and Bennett (1987) found that both eight-grade boys and girls enjoyed doing science 
experiments, but that boys were more enthusiastic than girls. Similarly, Simpson and Oliver 
(1985), in their multidimensional study among approximately 4,000 students across grades (6 th - 
10 th ), found that boys exhibited significantly more positive attitudes towards science than girls 
within each grade level as well as across the grades. Schibeci and Riley (1986), using a National 
Assessment of Educational Performance (NAEP) data set, examined the influence of five 
background variables: sex, race, home, environment, amount of homework, and parents’ 
education, on three dependent variables: student perception of science instruction, student 
attitudes, and student achievement. They found that gender had an influence on attitudes and 
achievement, with girls having less positive attitudes than boys. The NAEP indicated that boys 
have tended to have a more positive attitude toward science than girls and that this trend had 







535 



changed little over time (Mullis & Jenkins, 1988). In a meta-analysis of the literature from 1970 
to 1991 among 31 effect sizes representing the testing of 6,753 students (3,337 boys and 3,416 
girls) in 18 studies, Weinburgh (1995) examined gender differences in student attitudes toward 
science, and correlations between attitudes toward science and achievement in science. Results 
of this meta-analysis indicated that, from 1970 to 1991, boys had consistently shown a more 
positive attitude toward science than girls. This had not appeared to change over time. 

On the other hand, several researches indicated no gender differences in attitudes toward 
science and mathematics. Germann (1994) reviewed studies (Fleming & Malone, 1983; 

Warning, 1990; Simpson & Oliver, 1990) that indicated that there appears to be little or no 
relationship between gender and science attitude. Shepardson and Pizzini (1994), in their study 
among 268 middle school (7 th and 8 th grades) students, investigated the perception toward science 
activities and science achievement of boys and girls in middle school life science, and the results 
indicated no significant difference in perception by gender at middle school level study. Houtz 
(1995) compared two types of instructional organization strategies’ effects on science attitude 
among 570 seventh- and eighth-grade students within one school in an urban district in the 
Midwest. A proportionally stratified, randomly selected experimental group used the middle 
school interdisciplinary team strategy. The comparison group consisted of the traditional junior 
high science instructional strategy. The results revealed no significant differences between the 
attitudes toward science as a school subject of boys and girls, regardless of the instructional 
strategy. Barrington and Hendricks (1988) also found no gender differences with respect to 
attitudes toward science with gifted and average students. 

Some research showed, moreover, that girls have more positive attitudes toward science 
and mathematics than boys. Although it appears that, in general rather than in a specific 
discipline, boys have a more positive attitude toward science than girls, Schibeci (1984) reported 



in a narrative review of the literature that girls showed a more positive attitude toward biology, 
whereas boys showed a more positive attitude toward physics and chemistry. Moreover, Baker 
(1985) found that middle school girls in his study had significantly higher attitudes than did 
boys. 

Gender Differences in Attitudes Toward Science and Mathematics with Respect to Level of 
School 

Many researchers found that gender differences in attitudes toward science and 
mathematics vary as students move from elementary to the high school level. Cannon and 
Simpson (1985), in reports on a comprehensive, longitudinal investigation among 821 adolescent 
students, found that a positive attitude towards science deteriorated throughout the school years. 
Hueftle, Rakow, and Welch (1983) found that attitudes toward science became more negative 
during the middle school years. Middle grades comprise the stage when students formulate their 
gender identities and career aspirations (AAUW, 1992; Oaks, 1990; Sadker, M., Sadker, D., & 
Klein, 1991). This stage of schooling represents an important opportunity for encouraging 
students to consider scientific careers. 

Research studies indicate that pertaining to elementary school students, gender 
differences in science achievement tests, grades, or attitudes do not exist. Gender differences in 
test scores, course work, and attitudes emerge in the middle grades and become heavily 
pronounced by the time students reach their senior year in high school. In the middle grades, 
gender differences begin to appear in attitudes toward science; boys are more likely than girls to 
find science interesting or to envision that they will use mathematics and science as adults 
(AAUW, 1992; Lockheed et al., 1985; Oakes, 1990). By high school, few young women 
consider quantitative and science-related careers to be desirable options. Young women also 
have relatively high levels of performance anxiety and little confidence in their quantitative 



abilities and they attribute their success to luck rather than their own efforts and abilities (Cross, 
1988; Fennema,1984; Fox, 1980; Linn & Hyde, 1989; Lockheed et al., 1985; Norman, 1988; 
Schronberger, 1980). Linn and Hyde (1989) cited studies (Dossey, Mullis, Lindquist, & 
Chambers, 1988; Eccles, 1984; Eccles, Adler, & Meece, 1984; Grandy, 1987; Hilton & 

Berglund, 1974; and National Science Board, 1987) that provided evidence that boys and girls 
shared equal interest in mathematics and science in the elementary grades but that boys had a 
greater interest by the end of high school; these differences persisted through the 1980s and 
continued enrollment in science and mathematics courses was a result of the subject’s perceived 
usefulness, which means girls continue to have restricted views about the usefulness of science 
for their future. 

Gender Differences in Attitudes Toward Science and Mathematics with Respect to Constructivist 
Approach 

There are several researches who have investigated how the constructivist approach 
effects boys and girls’ attitudes toward science and mathematics. The learning situation can 
affect the attitude students develop toward science (Hofstein, Scherz, & Yager, 1986; Kulm, 
1980; Talton & Simpson, 1987). Although there is evidence that boys benefit more from 
traditional instructional activities, whereas girls benefit more from cooperative and hands-on 
activities, the evidence is inconclusive (Oakes, 1990). Kahle (1990) has stated that inquiry- 
oriented instruction has the potential of producing equitable outcomes in attitude and 
achievement, and Glaton (1981) concluded that girls prefer inquiry-oriented instruction. 
Summary 

Despite the numerous findings documenting gender differences in science-related 
attitudes, the conflicting results from different studies make it difficult to determine whether, in 
general, there are gender differences in student attitudes toward science (Weinburgh, 1995). 



Weinburgh (1995) noted in his meta-analysis several implications for further research. One was 
the practical need to continue research that examines strategies in the classroom for improving all 
students’ attitudes toward science, especially those of female students, another was the need to 
continue research that examines attitudes, gender, and grade level. Research needs to address the 
question of when attitudes begin to decline and then try to determine why they do so. Oakes 
(1990) strongly suggested we need additional basic research on how individual factors, such as 
self-efficacy and anxiety, may be linked to gender. It is important to monitor overall trends in 
the status of women in science and mathematics and to translate these data into indicators that are 
accessible to policy makers and educators (Oakes, 1990). Oakes (1990) also stated we need 
research documenting which special intervention programs developed by schools in mathematics 
and science have effectively increased persistence in scientific and mathematics choices among 
girls and women. 

Methodology 

This is a descriptive study which investigates the student attitudes toward science and 
mathematics of boys and girls in a large school district in mid-west region where a systemic 
reform effort has been undertaken. 

Study Population — Sample 

The sampling plan utilized was a disproportionate stratified random sample to represent 
school levels (elementary, middle, and high school), and tiers (I, II, and III, which represented 
classification of schools by degree of phase-in of systemic reform efforts). Tier I received in- 
depth implementation of systemic reform efforts in 1994-95, tier II in 1995-96, and tier III in 
1996-97. The sampling plan was developed to ensure random selection and provide reasonably 
good size samplings. A three stage sampling process was used. The first stage consisted of 
randomly selecting fifty four schools by tier (10 elementary, 5 middle, and 3 high schools for 



3 

ERIC 



each tier). For the second stage, the principal of the elementary school, the mathematics and 
science unit head at middle school, and the mathematics department head and science department 
head at the high school were asked to randomly select two homerooms/classrooms from their 
school. At the elementary level, fourth grade students were surveyed, eighth graders for middle 
school, and tenth graders for high school. The third stage consisted of surveying all of the 
students in these selected homerooms/classrooms. Given this scheme, a total of fifty four 
schools were sent surveys with an estimated 1 ,080 students approached to complete the 
questionnaire. Completed questionnaires were received from 815 students totaling a 75 % 
response rate. 

Data Collection — Instruments 

A survey was conducted to gather information from students about instructional practices 
used and attitudes toward science and mathematics, and was also conducted to solicit suggestions 
for improving these programs. The twenty-four item attitudinal section of this survey developed 
by Wayne State University will be the focus of this research paper. This survey instrument 
employed a Likert scale for attitudinal measurement. Each item contains four response levels: 
strongly agree, agree, disagree, and strongly disagree. The response levels were weighted 
according to their positive attitudes toward science and mathematics, ranging from four (most 
positive) to one (least positive). 

According to item-total summary statistics and Cronbach’s alpha, the reliabilities for 
Attitudes about Mathematics section, Attitudes about Science section, and these sections 
combined, were found to be .61, .66, and .73, respectively; however, a pair of item statements “I 
don’t worry about how well I will do on math tests” and “I don’t worry about how well I will do 
on science tests” indicated poor correlation between item and total scores for the remaining 
items. By nature, these item statements are very ambiguous; students could reply to these 



540 



statements by indicating either a positive attitude (confidence) or negative attitude (carelessness). 
Therefore, an attempt was made to improve scale internal consistency by removing these two 
items with low item-total correlations (i.e., correlations between a certain item and the rest of the 
scale excluding that item) in analyses by item. We decided, however, to include these items in 
analyses by factor, because these items loaded highly on an important factor, suggesting that it 
would be premature to discard them from these analyses. After excluding these items, the 
reliabilities for Attitudes about Mathematics section, Attitudes about Science section, and these 
sections combined, were found to be .69, .71, and .79, respectively, which was considered to be 
at an acceptable reliability level, since a guideline often used is to require alpha to be .70 or 
above (Rodeghier, 1 996). 

For the purposes of implementing the Systemic Initiative, the entire school district was 
divided into three tiers which consisted of constellations (elementary, middle, and high school) 
of schools. The number of schools in each tier vary in size, for example, tier I has the smallest 
number of schools and tier III has the largest number of schools. In order to insure that there 
would be representation from schools from all tiers, schools were selected disproportionately to 
their proportion in the population of schools. To represent the entire district, respondent groups 
were weighted across tier and school level; we can ensure that each group (by level and tier) is 
represented proportionately to its distribution within the population by maintaining the same 
ratio of school level and tier. 

Data Analysis 

All analysis were conducted using SPSS. 

Summary of dependent and independent variable definitions are displayed in Table 1 . 



Analysis by item. 



Because the same variables are measured for each subject (mathematics and science), we 
conducted a repeated measures design for Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) by 
Gender, Level, Tier, and Subject. In a repeated measures design for Multivariate Analysis of 
Variance (MANOVA), “Within-Subjects Factor” distinguishes measurements made on the same 
case to specify a doubly multivariate repeated measures design (more than one variable is 
measured at each combination of the factor levels); “Between-Subjects Factor” divides the 
sample into discrete subgroups. Pillais Multivariate Test of Significance are employed for F 
statistic. Eleven pairs, twenty-two items were analyzed with a2x2x3x3 (Gender x Subject 
Area x Level x Tier) repeated measures MANOVA, with subject area (mathematics and science) 
serving as the within-subjects variable and with gender, level, and tier serving as between- 
subjects variables. 

This analysis was done across all pairs of items. Further analyses were conducted at the 
individual item level when the overall F was significant. This is a case ofa2x2x3x3 factorial 
analysis; therefore, there are fifteen related hypotheses that we can test in this design. 

Analysis by factor. 

Missing data are common in surveys, for many legitimate reasons; however, it should be 
determined whether data is missing at random or whether some respondents have more missing 
data than others, ether on the whole or for only certain questions. Although there was some 
missing data for all questions (items), 498 respondents had no missing values for the entire set of 
24 questions. There were many students who didn’t answer each question (n = 317), but the total 
amount of missing data was not considered to be problematic. However, there were 100 people 
who didn’t provide a valid answer for all of the questions. If the missing data here is replaced 
with the mean value of that variable, it could be problematic; therefore, a decision was made to 
exclude cases list-wise, which meant using only cases with valid values for all variables in the 




542 



565 



factor analysis. Even with the omission of cases with incomplete data, a sufficient number of 
cases (N = 498) remained to conduct a satisfactory factor analysis. 

Items were submitted for principal components factor analysis to reduce the number of 
variables to a smaller set. This operation can identify an underlying, not observable construct 
that is represented by a set of attitude items and can simplify the description of the survey results 
with more reliable measures of the factor. 

Principal components analysis with varimax rotation method, which maximizes the 
explained variance, was performed on all 24 items to generate orthogonal factors. Since Kaiser- 
Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy was found to be 0.73, we can comfortably proceed 
with the factor analysis. Factors with eigenvalues greater than 1.0 were retained for subsequent 
analyses, yielding eight factors to be extracted. These eight factors accounted for 64% of the 
variance. Eight extracted Factors were displayed in Table 2. 

There were four items which loaded highly on the first factor. This factor (Factor 1) is 
described as measuring the confidence in students mathematics abilities. Four items loaded 
highly on the second factor (Factor 2) which appears to measure the confidence in students 
science abilities. Another four items loaded highly on the third factor (Factor 3) which is 
described as measuring the students’ perceived utility of science. Four other items loaded highly 
on the forth factor (Factor 4) which appears to measure the students’ perceived utility of 
mathematics. These four factors show the student attitudes distinctly oriented with subject 
matter. 

Two other items which loaded highly on the fifth factor (Factor 5) are described as 
measuring the perception of the female role in mathematics and science. Another two items 
loaded highly on the sixth factor (Factor 6) which appears to measure the perception of the male 
role in mathematics and science. These two factors show students’ sex stereotyping in both 



mathematics and science. Two other items loaded highly on the seventh factor (Factor 7) which 
is described as measuring the students’ anxiety to succeed on mathematics and science tests. 

Two other items loaded highly on the eighth factor (Factor 8) which appears to measure the 
students’ intention or desire to study mathematics and science in college. These four factors 
show the student attitudes regardless of subject matter. 

In the next stage of the analysis, regression factor scores on the above factors were 
examined as the dependent variable for Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) by 
gender, school level, and tier. This is a case of a 2 x 3 x 3 factorial analysis; therefore, there are 
seven related hypotheses that we can test in this design. 

Results 

For Analysis by Item 

Across the board there were gender differences (F = 14.81, p = .000), level differences (F 
= 4.19, p = .000), and subject differences (F = 21.58, p = .000). Whereas the significant subject 
differences were revealed in four pairs of items. Two of them favored mathematics rather than 
science: “I will use math/science as an adult” [ F(l, 588) = 150.71, p < .05 ] and “It is important 
to know math/science to get a good job” [ F(l, 595) = 157.88, p < .01 ]. The other two favored 
science rather than mathematics: “® Doing math/science often makes me nervous or upset” [ 

F(l, 604) = 10.97, p < .01 ] and “® I often get scared when I open my math/science book and see 
a page of problems” [ F(l, 594) = 7.15, p < .01 ]. It is, however, the interactions that are of most 
interest. 

The results of the repeated measures MANOVA across the board and the repeated 
measures MANOVA for each pair of items are presented in Appendix A with related mean 
scores. The results, subjected to repeated measures MANOVA across the board, showed a 
significant four way interaction for Gender x Level x Tier x Subject for overall student attitudes 



toward mathematics and science ( F — 1.89, p — .000). The results of repeated measures 
MANOVA for each pair of items indicated statistically significant four way interaction for 
Gender x Level x Tier x Subject on six pairs of items out of 1 1 possible pairs of items; “I am 
good at math/science” [ F(4, 613) = 5.65, p < .01 ], “® I do not enjoy math/science” [ F(4, 599) 
= 6.55, p < .01 ], “® Doing math/science often makes me nervous or upset” [ F(4, 604) = 

5.32, p < .01 ], “I am interested in a career in math/science” [ F(4, 605) = 2.75, p < .05 ], “I will 
use math/science as an adult” [ F(4, 588) = 2.43, p < .05 ], and “It is important to know 
math/science to get a good job” [ F(4, 595) = 3.78, p < .01 ]. The three way interactions for 
Gender x Level x Tier approached significance on a student attitude “® I often get scared when I 
open my math/science book and see a page of problems” [ F(4, 594) = 2.822, p < .05 ] with the 
significant main effect favoring science rather than mathematics. Furthermore, there was a 
significant three way interaction for Gender x Level x Subject on “Math/Science helps a person 
think logically” [ F(2, 569) = 3.12, p < .05 ]. The significant two-way interactions for Gender x 
Level were revealed on three pairs of items; “® Boys are generally better at math/science than 
are girls [ F(2, 597) = 9.12, p < .01 ], “® Math/Science is more useful for girls than for boys” [ 
F(2, 608) = 6.12, p < .01 ], and “® I am not interested in studying math/science in college” [ F(2, 
609) = 4.95, p < .01 ]. Although several simple main effects reached statistical significance , 
they are of little interest because these interaction effects are the most interesting of the results. 
For Analysis bv Factor 

Across the board there were gender differences (F = 13.66, p = .000) and level differences 
(F = 6.06, p = .000); however, it is the interactions that are of most interest. 

The results of MANOVA for all factors 1 through 8 and ANOVA for each factor are 
presented in Appendix B with related mean scores. The results, subjected to MANOVA for all 
factors 1 through 8, showed a significant three way interaction for Gender x Level x Tier for all 



factors 1 through 8 [ F — 1.93, p — .001 ]. The results of ANOVA by each factor revealed 
significant three way interactions for Gender x Level x Tier on confidence in mathematics and 
science abilities; [ F(4, 459) = 3.63, p < .01 ] and [ F(4, 459) = 7.79, p < .01 ], respectively. In 
addition, the significant simple main effect of gender with boys higher than girls were detected 
for both confidence in mathematics and science abilities; [ F(l, 459) = 20.74, p < .01 ] and [ F(l, 
459) = 4.01, p < .05 ], respectively. There were two way interactions for Gender x Level on 
perception of the female and the male role in math/science; [ F(2, 459) = 6.83, p < .01] and [ F(2, 
459) = 8.18, p < .01], respectively. In addition, the significant simple main effect of gender with 
boys higher than girls were detected for perception of the female role in mathematics and science 
[ F(l, 459) = 4.95, p < .05 ]. Conversely, girls scored significantly higher than boys for 
perception of the male role in mathematics and science [ F(l, 459) = 68.16, p < .01 ]. There was 
a significant simple main effect of level with elementary school students scoring higher than both 
middle and high school on intention or desire to study mathematics and science in college [ F(2, 
459) = 5.46, p < .01 ]. Also, a significant simple main effect of gender with boys higher than 
girls was detected for anxiety to succeed on mathematics and science tests [ F(l, 459) = 4.52, p 
< .05 ]. No significant differences and interaction existed in perceived utility of mathematics nor 
science. 

Discussion 

It appears in analyses both by items and by factors that, in general, boys have more 
favorable attitudes toward mathematics and science than do girls. This is consistent with the 
findings of Catsambis (1995); AAUW (1992); Czemiak & Chiarelott (1984); Kahle (1983); 
Kurth, (1987); Lowery, Bowyer, & Padillia, (1980); Simpson & Oliver (1985); Schibeci & Riley 
(1986); Mullis & Jenkins (1988); and Weinburgh (1995). Student attitudes toward mathematics 




546 



and science, however, vary not only by gender, but by school level, subject area, and tier phase 
as well. 

With regard to confidence in mathematics abilities ( see Figure 1 ), there are strong 
gender differences which reveal that boys have more confidence in their mathematics abilities 
than girls. This tendency is constant among all tier phases throughout all school levels with only 
one exception: only girls in the tier III phase at the elementary school level have slightly higher 
confidence in their mathematics abilities than those of their male counterparts. This may be due 
to low confidence in mathematics abilities of elementary school boys who are in the tier III 
phase. At the elementary school level, whereas girls’ confidence in their mathematics abilities is 
low and fluctuates less among all tier phases, boys’ confidence varies dramatically by tier level— 
especially boys at the elementary school tier III level have significantly lower confidence them 
those of elementary boys in tier I and II phases; therefore, the pattern of gender difference 
reverse at the elementary school level in tier III phases. Furthermore, school level has a 
substantial effect on the students’ confidence in their mathematics abilities. Middle school 
students are most likely to have confidence in their mathematics abilities, high school students 
are those who are least likely to have a confidence in their mathematics abilities, regardless of 
gender or tier phase. That is, both boys and girls in any tier phases tend to lose a confidence in 
their mathematics abilities as they move from middle to high school level with only one 
exception: only boys in tier III phase gain confidence in their mathematics abilities as they move 
from middle to high school level. In contrast, girls in tier III phase lose confidence in their 
mathematics abilities dramatically as they move from middle to high school level, and high 
school girls in tier III phase have the lowest level of confidence in their mathematics abilities 
among the entire population; thus, an opposite pattern exists between boys and girls in tier III 
phase when they move from middle to high school level. This is the reason why high school 



students in tier III show the greatest gender gap with boys who have much higher confidence in 
their mathematics abilities than their female counterparts. 

Although gender has an effect on students’ confidence in their science abilities as well as 
those of their confidence in mathematics, the gender inequalities for students’ confidence are less 
in science than in mathematics. Because students’ confidence in their science abilities vary so 
much by gender, school level, and tier phase, there is no particular pattern in the student 
confidence in science abilities. Significant gender differences can be observed for students at the 
elementary school tier III level and for high school students in the tier II level. In both cases, 
boys show much higher confidence in their science abilities than their female counterparts ( see 
Figure 2 ). 

Gender and school level have substantial effects on the sex stereotyping in mathematics 
and science. Boys, more than girls, believe that boys are better at mathematics and science than 
girls, regardless of school level. Although elementary school boys are most likely to believe that 
boys are better at mathematics and science than girls, they lose this perception steadily as they 
get older ( see Figure 3 ). This decline of boys’ sex stereotyping may be due to boys losing 
confidence in their mathematics and science abilities, especially in mathematics, as they get 
older. On the other hand, girls are least likely to believe this stereotype and this tendency 
remains stable throughout all school levels; therefore, gender gap in this sex stereotyping ( with 
boys holding this stereotype more than girls ) is greatest at the elementary school level, 
decreasing gradually from elementary to middle school level, and even more sharply from 
middle to high school level. 

In contrast, gender differences in another type of sex stereotyping in mathematics and 
science show a totally opposite pattern by school level. Elementary school girls are most likely 
to believe that mathematics and science are more useful for girls than for boys; however, high 




school girls are least likely to believe so ( see Figure 4 ). That is, girls hold this stereotype more 
strongly at the elementary school level and they lose this stereotype dramatically as they get 
older. This decline of girls sex stereotyping may be due to girls placing themselves in more 
traditional roles as they get older. Oakes (1990) explains that girls expect a conflict between 
math/science and family later in life; therefore, they lose their perceptions of the usefulness of 
mathematics and science for themselves as they get older. On the other hand, boys are less likely 
to believe that mathematics and science are more useful for girls than for boys and such a 
tendency remains consistent throughout all school levels. Gender gap in this sex stereotyping, 
therefore, is greatest at elementary school level with girls exhibiting this stereotype more than 
boys. This gender gap, however, decreases sharply from elementary to middle school level. 

Even more, this gender gap is reversed when students reach the high school level with boys'" 
displaying this stereotype rather than girls. These findings point to prejudiced or preconceived 
notions which suggest that sex stereotyping in mathematics and science decline rather rapidly 
with age, and that boys and girls do not stereotype equally. 

With regard to test anxiety, there are slight gender differences appear as to feelings of 
success on mathematics and science tests. The findings indicate that girls have slightly more 
anxiety about succeeding on mathematics and science tests than do boys. 

School level has a substantial effect on students’ intention to pursue mathematics and 
science in college. For both genders and among all tier phases, students tend to lose their desire 
to pursue further study of mathematics and science in college. These findings add to the existing 
literature which reports similar findings for school level differences in student attitudes; science 
attitudes deteriorate throughout the school years (Cannon & Simpson, 1985). 

No substantial effect appears as to perceived utility of mathematics and science. Both 
girls and boys believe both subjects are important and will be useful to their careers. This does 



549

12 



not support the finding of numerous researchers who found more boys than girls perceiving 
mathematics and science as useful to their future career goals (Kahle, 1984; AAUW, 1992; 



Lockheed et al., 1985; Oakes, 1990; Dossey, Mullis, Lindquist, & Chambers, 1988; Eccles, 

1984; Eccles, Adler, & Meece, 1984; Grandy, 1987; Hilton & Berglund, 1974; and National 
Science Board, 1987). The systemic reform efforts of the school district in this study may 
explain the reason why there is little gender difference here in perceived utility of math/science 
that is opposed to the findings reported in the literature. This finding of perceived utility, 
together with those of other attitudes, can provide a very interesting and useful analysis. That is, 
both boys and girls believe mathematics and science are useful to their future career goals; 
however, they have different attitudes toward mathematics and science. Although girls recognize 
that they have to use these subjects in the future, they feel less confidence and less of a liking of 
mathematics and science than do boys. This phenomenon can be explained by distinguishing 
between emotional and realistic attitude toward mathematics and science. Whereas girls’ 
realistic attitudes are positive and reflect the dominant self-efficacy ideology, their emotional 
attitudes are more pessimistic and reflect their limited confidence and liking. 

When the subject areas are considered (mathematics and science), there are differences 
found between mathematics and science in the repeated measures analyses. Both boys and girls 
see mathematics rather than science as more relevant to their future, whereas they see 
mathematics rather than science as a subject which makes them more nervous, upset, and even 
scared. Girls more often tend to be subject to mathematics anxiety at high school level. 

Conclusions and Implications 

The ultimate goal of this study is to seek ways that students can become more effective 
learners. Teachers can use these findings to design instruction specifically tailored to the needs 
of their students.

The following tentative conclusions may best capture our current understanding of 
student attitudes toward mathematics and science in gender differences for systemic reform 
efforts. Wayne State University’s Survey of Student Attitudes Toward Mathematics and Science 
provide appropriate psychometric evidence of overall reliability ( a = .79). The factor analysis 
identified the following eight underlying factors which were psychologically interpretable: 
confidence in mathematics abilities, confidence in science abilities, perceived utility of science, 
perceived utility of mathematics, perception of the female role in mathematics and science, 
perception of the male role in mathematics and science, anxiety to succeed on mathematics and 
science tests, and intention or desire to study mathematics and science in college. Furthermore, 
the findings of this study suggest that girls feel less confident than boys in their abilities to 
succeed in mathematics and science; moreover, both, genders have less confidence in their 
mathematics abilities than those of science. Girls feel more anxiety about succeeding on 
mathematics and science tests than do boys. Girls see sex stereotyping in these subjects 
differently than boys; however, they see mathematics and science as relevant to their futures as 
well as boys do, although both genders believe that mathematics is more useful for their future 
than science. Furthermore, both boys and girls, as they get older, lose their desire to pursue these 
subjects in college. 

Although there are no important gender differences in perceived math/science utility and 
though both boys and girls perceive utility of mathematics and science positively, girls express 
much less confidence in mathematics and science. Systemic reform efforts, therefore, should 
find a way of increasing girls’ confidence in mathematics and science, particularly in 
mathematics where gender differences are greatest. 




551 



Interventions like the systemic reform initiative in mathematics and science to change 
girls’ attitudes may increase their achievement and their willingness to pursue the opportunities 
which are now available. Of highest priority are continued and expanded efforts to monitor 
overall trends in the students — particularly in girls attitudes toward mathematics and science-- 
and to translate these data into indicators that are useful and accessible to policy makers and 
educators.

TEXTBOOK ANALYSES: PRESERVICE ELEMENTARY 
TEACHERS’ DEBUTS IN THE ROLE OF TEACHER AS 
RESEARCHER 



Laura Downey-Skochdopole, Kansas State University 
Marion Jenice French, Kansas State University 

Purpose and Rationale 

As in the past, a time came over the summer to begin to plan for the fall semester of 
teaching the elementary science teaching methods course that nearly 80 preservice teachers would 
enroll in. While sitting and contemplating the upcoming semester, reflecting back cm past 
semesters, and striving for something better, an idea began to take shape. Both of the instructors, 
one a professor, the other a graduate student, have a long standing interest in the notion of teacher 
empowerment as a process and vehicle for social and political reform in education. Empowerment 
as we define it is a mind set that frees teachers and students to be powerful and decisive forces in 
shaping their own classrooms and beyond. Empowerment promotes shifts in power relationships 
within the school setting giving teachers and students voice in redefining and restructuring their 
schools, liberating them to be guided by their own visions. This notion is intricately related to 
what Stenhouse (1983) refers to as emancipation. In his writing he states, “The essence of 
emancipation as I conceive it is the intellectual, moral and spiritual autonomy which we recognise 
when we eschew paternalism and the role of authority and hold ourselves obliged to appeal to 
judgment” (Stenhouse, p. 163). It is a freeing from their “false consciousness,” a state which 
Geuss (1981) describes as an acceptance of society’s norms and living within them without 
questioning them (Geuss, p. 59). It is within this constraint of “false consciousness” that the true 
interests of the individual lie dormant, unexamined and thus become a restraining force, partially 
but not entirely self imposed. As instructors of preservice elementary teachers, it is this 
emancipation within ourselves and our students that we seek. We are well aware that such 
emancipation cannot be taught, but rather an environment must be created that nurtures this 
unshackling within ourselves and our preservice elementary teachers. We acknowledge that such a 
feat would be impossible within the sixteen week course that we teach, but ideally, as we instruct 
the first in a series of course work our preservice teachers take, we can at least be the initial 
impetus towards such emancipatory reconstructions about teaching and learning science. 




584 '607 



It was with this ever present desire to foster and nurture a sense of empowerment in the 
future teachers with whom we interact that this first bud of an idea began to take shape and unfold. 
As in most preservice education programs (on average comprised of 86% females, according to 
Nelson, Weiss, & Capper, 1990), the preservice elementary teachers whom we serve are 
predominantly female. In dealing with such a student population, an awareness of women’s ways 
of constructing knowledge becomes important for effective instruction to take place. It is the way 
in which women, though certainly not limited to women, come to know, through an immersion in 
the learning process and making the knowledge their own that such a transformation takes place 
(Maher, 1987). By utilizing this gender model advocated by Belenky, Clinchy, Goldberg, and 
Tarule (1986), we orchestrate experiences that our preservice elementary teachers explore which 
allows them to connect their cognitive knowledge to personal experience. Perhaps by utilizing 
such methodologies, we will begin them on their journey towards emancipation and 
empowerment. 

Furthermore, as with most instructors, the notion of utilizing such a powerful strategy 
within a relevant context was immensely appealing. Our preservice teachers have come to see 
textbooks as a driving force in what they teach. This originates from their past indoctrination using 
textbooks as symbolic representations of the ‘power of knowledge’, ‘the official version’ of what 
is true, both in terms of knowledge and society’s norms, values, and expectations (Scardina, 

1 972). In past courses, the preservice teachers have expressed an interest in finding out more 
about the texts; and it became evident in some of the things that they said that their understandings 
of the relationships between teaching and textbooks are fairly fixed. In one of our previous 
classes, as the preservice elementary teachers labored over writing lesson plans, one of our more 
outspoken preservice teachers raised her hand and asked quite pointedly, “Why do we spend so 
much time on this when the textbooks have the lesson plans already written out for us?” The 
notion of future teachers being as textbook dependent as many inservice teachers, was highly 
disconcerting. This becomes especially worrisome within science where numerous analyses have 
found textbooks to be lacking, and criticize them as doing little or nothing to promote critical 
thinking in science (Risner, Skeel and Nicholson, 1992). But it is one thing to present these 
findings about textbooks to our preservice teachers and another thing altogether to make this 
knowledge their own; to provide opportunities for our preservice teachers to discover this

themselves. So the questions become— Where does knowledge originate? How do we know what 
we know? 

With this philosophy in mind, the piece in the puzzle that remained missing was the how, 
the method for engaging preservice elementary teachers in discovering and exploring their own 
understandings of science textbooks. Much has been reported about the power of placing inservice 
teachers into the role of researchers as an agent that liberates and redefines the roles that they play 
within their classrooms and schools. As stated by Hopkins (1993, p. 35), 

The major consequence of doing this is that teachers take more control of their professional 
lives. Not content to be told what to do or being uncertain about what it is one is doing, 
teachers who engage in their own research are developing their professional judgment and 
are moving towards emancipation and autonomy. 

It seemed a natural extension to look at how we could begin to coalesce the two, gently nudging 
pre service teachers into the role of researcher and doing so in a way that was relevant and 
meaningful to them while not overwhelming and stifling their initiatives; It was decided that we 
would use an inquiry/discovery approach in moving the preservice teachers towards becoming 
researchers, thus allowing them to engage in research in a very non-threatening environment 
Utilizing such an approach, the preservice elementary teachers were unaware that the activity they 
were about to embark upon placed them in the role of researcher. Guidelines were open-ended and 
exploratory in nature, with the expectation that both instructors and preservice elementary teachers 
would be learning together as the project developed. The task of analyzing textbooks was 
scheduled into the syllabus. With the uneasiness of trying something for the first time, we began, 
not knowing exactly what to expect 

The following is a narrative, a partial reconstruction of the events, actions, thoughts and 
words of the participants from their own perspectives as the activity began. 

The Beginning 

Fall semester begins at this Midwestern university with three sections of “Elementary 
Science Teaching Methods” offered by two instructors who work collaboratively to teach the 
course. As the preservice elementary teachers enter the class for the first session, their trepidation 
is obvious. In part, it was the nervousness of beginning a new course and not yet knowing the 



ERjt 



586 



SOS 



expectations for that class, but there is something more insidious there. As the preservice 
elementary teachers begin by engaging in a discussion of their memories of science, it became clear 
that another fear was acting upon them; a fear that was deeply embedded in previous negative 
experiences with science and a dread that this course will not be any different for them. This 
anxiety is clearly voiced in many of the preservice elementary teachers’ journal entries for the first 
week of class. About 52% of the 78 preservice elementary teachers directly expressed negative 
attitudes and feelings about science. In addition, another 10 to 15% made no indication in either 
direction as to their feelings or attitudes about science. The responses analyzed from journal 
entries indicating negative responses or feelings about science ranged from those who said that 
they never liked science because it was all memorization from the textbook to others who voiced 
insecurities about their abilities to do science. One preservice elementary teacher related that she 
had received low test scores on her IOWA Test of Basic Skills early on in her schooling and felt 
that based on this, teachers made the assumption that she couldn’t do science and treated her 
accordingly. Consequently, she began to dislike science. She reflects in her journal, “I can’t 
believe I let them tell me that I couldn’t do science.” A few preservice elementary teachers even 
stated that they hated science and nothing that we could do would change their minds. Some of the 
preservice elementary teachers discussed specific teachers that ‘turned them off” from doing 
science. Many could not even remember elementary science. Out of the preservice elementary 
teachers that held more positive attitudes towards science, most discussed the fact that they had 
always been interested in science and some stated that their interest in science persevered despite 
their negative experiences in school. 

Throughout the course, the preservice elementary teachers engage in discussions and 
lively, open discourse triggered by activities designed to explore the nature of science. These 
activities are engaged in with the aim that the preservice teachers will begin to redefine the way that 
they perceive science and the teaching of science. The activities included a mystery tube activity, 
several labs designed to explore the nature of science, articles to which the preservice teachers react 
that address the nature of science and projects such as experimental designs that engage the 
preservice elementary teachers in doing science like scientists. These activities are designed 
specifically to provoke and challenge preservice elementary teachers ways of thinking about 
science and science teaching. For example, two weeks following the mystery tube experience, 




587 



'610 



Christy asked her instructor, “Are you ever going to show us what is inside the tube? Are we ever 
going to find out how it works?” It was at this point that the instructor responded by saying, “Did 
Mendel ever see a gene? Did Bohr ever see an atom? And the answer to your question is, no.” 

To this Christy grinned. It is these continual probes and reflections about science and science 
teaching and learning that we wish to spark in this course. 

Thus, in an attempt to combine the natural interest expressed by previous classes of 
preservice teachers in science textbooks and provide another activity that might help them to 
question, reshape, and expand their images of science and science teaching, the new activity was 
introduced to the course. Again, the activity was designed specifically to thrust the preservice 
teachers into the role of teacher as researcher as they engaged in science textbook analysis, though 
the notion of doing research was never overtly part of the scenario. A spurious outcome was that 
they explored the nature of science and some of its underlying tenets while conducting the 
research. These tenets included science as a process; a way of knowing that is parsimonious, 
amoral, testable, objective, unified, developmental; and a human endeavor. While this was a 
desirous outcome, it was not the main thrust of the activity. 

The Text Analysis Process 

The preservice teachers were given a scenario about two thirds of the way into the semester 
which involved a final presentation to the school board reporting their team evaluations and 
recommendations for adoption of a new science textbook series. As a way of beginning, the 
preservice teachers were immersed as individuals with a probe into their notions of the nature of 
science teaching and an exploration of the roles of an elementary science teacher. Data collected at 
this point included written lists of descriptors of what an elementary science teacher does and 
drawings done by the individual teachers of what an elementary science teacher looks like. The 
preservice teachers then moved into small groups for discussion of the characteristics and roles of 
science teachers they had generated and the activity culminated in a whole group list. The groups 
then presented their lists to the class and the pre service elementary teachers noted during 
discussion, similarities and differences as well as frequency of their responses, thus giving them a 
view of how they and others perceived the roles of an elementary science teacher. Common 





588 



descriptors across the three sections were coded and categorized by the instructors with the 
descriptors falling into one of four groups. 

The first category encompassed affective qualities, those qualities which evoke a feeling or 
emotional response. Descriptors within this category included both positive and negative attributes 
such as: persistent, vivacious, caring, boring, weird (unable to relate to students), and an 
entertainer. A second category that surfaced embodied instructional roles, more directly related to 
what teachers do in the classroom. Examples of descriptors within this category included: 
performs assessments, opens children’s minds, guides communication, creates a good learning 
environment, reinforces questioning, guides ideas, and motivates the class to take charge of 
learning. The third category that originated in the data focused more on science instructional 
roles. The roles included in this set of descriptors are items such as: explores systems and their 
senses so they can know the world around diem, facilitates the student’s exploration of scientific 
knowledge, clears up misconceptions about science, explores nature and explains it to students so 
that they can use and understand it as well as less positive descriptors like never uses manipulatives 
and tells you not to touch anything. The final category portrays the physical attributes of an 
elementary science teacher. Descriptors in this section included: women (1 1 out of 20), men (9 
out of 20), wears goggles, old, middle aged, wears comfortable clothes, short, wears glasses, 
bald-headed, tall and thin, and wears a lab coat Given these descriptors, there are noticeable 
stereotypical attributes of scientists (Finson, Beaver, and Crammond, 1995) in the list While their 
lists were extensive, we were interested to find that in not one individual or group case did the role 
of researcher emerge across the three classes beginning this project Also interesting, clearly 
reflected were their experience within the science methods course, witnessed in descriptors such as 
‘clears up misconceptions’. 

It was also intriguing to note in their drawings of ah elementary science teacher that 
approximately half of the drawings, 34 of 65 total, featured males in the role of science teacher and 
among their depictions, whether male or female, there were several similarities. Most of the 
pictures were fairly traditional in that the teacher wore a lab coat, was in a lab setting at the front of 
the room and was surrounded by science equipment, such as beakers, test tubes, and other 
apparatus. Many of the pictures were teacher-centered with the teacher performing some sort of 
demonstration to the students. Only 22 out of 65 drawings depicted students, with only six of

589 



612 



those featuring children actively engaged. Only three of the pictures showed science outside of the 
classroom. This information served as a baseline for the instructors in interpreting how the 
preservice teachers viewed the role of an elementary science teacher and we were curious to know 
if their perceptions would change to include teacher as researcher as an important role after their 
course experiences and reflections. Therefore, upon completion of the text analysis, the preservice 
elementary teachers revisited their notions of roles of an elementary science teacher and in groups 
created a list of descriptors. While most of the roles descriptors remained relatively fixed, we were 
encouraged to find that 8 out of IS groups listed researcher as a role of an elementary science 
teacher. 

It was then time to get to the heart of the matter. Hie preservice elementary teachers self 
selected their textbook analysis teams and were given a set of student texts. Three of the texts 
series were utilized in school districts locally, and one, a more current edition, sent directly from 
the publisher. The textbooks analyzed were: Science (Silver, Burdett and Ginn, 1989), 

Discovery Science (Silver, Burdett and Ginn, 1995), Science for Life and Living (Biological 
Sciences Curriculum Study, 1992), and Science Turns Minds On (MacMillan/McGraw Hill, 1995). 
The textbooks were selected to represent a variety of grade levels from kindergarten through 5th 
grade and the preservice teachers were given few initial guidelines as to how they should evaluate 
their texts. The following scenario was presented as an impetus for their explorations: 

Figure 1 

Textbook Selection Committee Scenario 



Oct 21, 1996 



Dear Selection Committee, 

Thank you for giving your time to select grade level science textbooks. As a team you will need to 
develop a set of criteria in which to evaluate the textbooks that you have been given. Keep in 
mind that the textbooks selected must be of highest quality and best fit the needs of a diverse 
student population (textbooks are costly). One member of your team will document the 
process of how your team arrived at its criteria (documentation includes an 
ongoing description of your dialogue and decision making). 

You are only one team of the selection process. After you have developed your criteria you will 
meet with the other teams to negotiate a set of oommon criteria for all of you to use. Once the 
common criteria is settled upon, your team will then evaluate the text series you have been given. 
You will develop analysis protocols so that every one in your team will be analyzing in the 



same way. Keep accurate records of the text your group evaluates so comparisons across 
grade levels can be made. 

The final report should include the raw data, a description of how your team 
analyzed the data, your findings and recommendations. Your team will present and 
defend the findings of the textbook evaluation before members of the School Board. The 
recommendations based upon your evaluation will be taken into consideration by the School Board 
for adoption. 

The final report with be left with the members of the School Board for perusal after the formal 
presentation. 

Thank you and good luck. 



The School Board 



The preservice elementary teachers began the actual text analysis by reflecting on what was 
important in teaching elementary science and from there, as a class, a series of criteria of the critical 
components that should be present in a science textbook were developed. Time was spent as a 
class defining and refining those criteria, until there was consensus on what each team would 
evaluate their texts. Throughout this process, the instructors struggled with how much to 
intervene, prompting a series of discussions to find ways to guide them in this process without 
telling them how to do it or impose our expectations of what a textbook analysis should look like. 
The preservice teachers worked both in a whole class setting and then within their groups to 
operationally define the criteria for comparison between the different texts. The core criteria were 
developed by consensus and despite the idiosyncratic differences in our approaches as well as the 
fact that these negotiations took place in three separate classes, the criteria were strikingly similar 
between the different sections. The overlapping criteria that emerged from the pre service 
elementary teachers included evidence of: hands on activities (open ended vs. closed, 
investigations vs. experiments), higher level and critical thinking questions, illustrations that were 
accurate, relevant and non-biased, age appropriateness, readability, good organization and layout, 
opportunities to extend ideas and activities, and content that addressed the National Science 
Education Standards (NRC, 1996). The similarities can be attributed to the common instruction 
that they received in their methods courses, which clearly informed their choice of criteria, but it 
must be also recognized that they share common experiences with textbooks as students and this in 
some ways guided their criteria selection. Slight variations came about as groups designed their 




591 




4 



own individual methodologies for assessing the texts based on these criteria using both qualitative 
and quantitative approaches. 

The groups met both briefly in class and predominantly outside of class to evaluate their 
given texts. When asked to quantify the amount of time they spent on the text analyses, preservice 
elementary teachers reported anywhere from 10 to 18 hours on average Each group was required 
to keep a journal as documentation of the group process that they utilized while completing the 
textbook analysis, as well as continuing to individually keep a journal in which they reflected on 
their experiences. After a time that was negotiated between the preservice elementary teachers and 
the instructors, the preservice elementary teachers presented their findings to the class, utilizing 
charts, graphs, and other visual tools designed by each group to provide an in-depth portrait of the 
text they analyzed and their recommendations. Following the presentation of their findings, a final 
reflection questionnaire was given and follow up interviews were conducted. Throughout this 
process, the instructors also kept field notes on the project 

Findings. Constructions, and Interpretations 

Upon completion of the text analysis and as the semester drew to a close, both instructors 
breathed a collective sigh of relief. The text analysis turned out to be quite an exhaustive process 
for both the instructors and the preservice elementary teachers. Several of the preservice 
elementary teachers indicated in their journals a sense of relief and accomplishment in completing 
the analyses. As we stood back and began the long process of sorting through the data, we 
surprised ourselves at the sheer amount of data that we had managed to accumulate. Separately, it 
hadn’t appeared much, but collectively we realized that we had far more data than we had 
anticipated. We sorted through the data and contextually analyzed it for meaning, using an 
interpretive process (Gallagher, 1991). We individually coded the preservice elementary teacher’s 
words and the events surrounding the textbook analysis drawing out interpretative themes through 
categorization. We became the instruments of analysis reconstructing themes and patterns as they 
emerged from the data, using the constant comparative method (Glaser and Strauss, 1967) of 
comparing data from within and across categories. We continued to analyze the categories until 
they were saturated. Primary data sources included: preservice elementary teacher journals,

592 



615 



weekly instructor reflective sessions, random as well as purposefully sampled interviews, and 
artifacts including their individual assessments, drawings, descriptors of roles, final evaluations 
and the textbook analysis itself. Recognizing that any reconstruction is partial and positional, the 
ins tructors analyzed the data independently and then compared categories and negotiated themes for 
verification and triangulation. Both instructors intend on conducting a member check to add 
further validity to our findings when pre service elementary teachers return during the spring 
semester. From the data analysis, three major themes of the textbook research emerged. 

Response to the Teaching Methodology 

The first theme revolved around the open-ended methodology utilized by the instructors in 
the textbook research. Preservice elementary teachers indicated both in journals and verbally that 
the process was frustrating to them at times due to the lack of formal guidelines. Perhaps this is 
obvious, as stated by Chris in the early stages of the text analysis. He writes in his journal, 
“Worried about Textbook Analysis . I’m not sure about how and what. I have an idea, but I’m 
still not clear on how you want us to do it I might just be blowing things out of proportion, but 
you know.” This sentiment was voiced repeatedly with one preservice teacher finally saying to the 
instructor, quite exasperated, “I wish you would just tell us how to do this! !” She smiled in 
recognition of what she had said and then said, ”But I guess you are not going to do that, are 
you?" It was not until the actual analyses were completed that the preservice elementary teachers 
began to voice some comfort and satisfaction in the process. This is illustrated by Heather as she 
writes in her journal, “I think that the most frustrating part of it [the textbook analysis] was how 
open-ended it was. You didn’t tell us exactly what you wanted, and that was frustrating, but you 
made it like that purposely, right? I think this is good in a way because it let’s all the evaluations 
be different and we get a wide range of ideas and see different ways of doing things.” Another 
preservice elementary teacher, Holly, said, “I wasn’t quite sure what you were looking for. But 
once we presented, I was comfortable. I felt we accomplished what was needed to evaluate a 
text” Many of the preservice elementary teachers echoed the reflections of Heather and Holly in 
their journal, but there were still some preservice elementary teachers that continued to be 
uncomfortable and dissatisfied with the process. 

One preservice elementary teacher, Rachel, who was self-described as very concrete and 
sequential said this in her journal about the text analyses: 



O

593 



While I feel that the project was worthwhile, I have a few concerns. Making the project 
very open-ended was a good way to allow us freedom to evaluate the textbooks as we saw 
necessary. However, I would have felt much more confident if at least some guidelines 
were presented. I don’t think that the guidelines would be necessary for how to evaluate 
the textbooks, I agree that this needs to be as open as possible. Guidelines for the written 
and oral presentation would have been really helpful.. ..The guidelines would not need to 
be specific, just enough to give us direction and to help us feel a little more secure in what 
we are doing. 

It is clear that she is still not totally comfortable with the process and a large portion of her 
insecurity probably lies within her concern with her grades. She a high achieving student and 
always puts a great deal of effort into her work; pleasing and meeting the expectations of her 
instructor was still paramount. The text analysis was a graded assignment and as such, though we 
tried to leave the project as open as we possibly could, the fact that we as instructors still held the 
power of evaluation created some stress and discomfort among the preservice elementary teachers. 
This is a empowerment dilemma with which we continue to struggle. 

Changing Portraits of Research 

Beyond the methodologies utilized, this exploration was a way of knowing, an 
empowering experience through questioning and revisiting our own ideas as well as the preservice 
elementary teachers’ ideas of research and the values associated with it We found ourselves 
rethinking research as this study evolved. Jen a preservice teacher, said it best, “ Research is 
science,.. .it is questioning everything and never taking an answer to be true. ..as research is always 
a way to find out something.” Jen was on target The root of the word research, search, means to 
look intently for something, but it also means looking around at things. So research is looking 
again and paying attention to things in systematic ways. Teacher research is a way of knowing, a 
way of finding out The preservice teachers did not enter this course with the idea that they would 
be doing research. In fact, it was never addressed verbally. It did come out in conversations, 
journals, and interviews. We found patterns emerging from the data while preservice elementary 
teachers participated in and completed the text evaluation as well as other activities that related to 
their constructions of research. They began with images, we as instructors had not imagined, and 
left the course with self-reported changes in those images. Their ideas of research ranged from 



ERIC 




594 



being surrounded by books in a library and drawing upon them and the expert knowledge they 
hold, to images of research as something they never thought they could or would be able to do. 
Midge portrays the first image vividly, 

Research is hard, going to the library and having to look things up, having to get 
in-depth, get right at what your looking at When I think of research, I think of magazine 
articles, and research, like big thick books, and that’s where you get it all from, the stacks. 
Barb, another preservice teacher, connected this image and stated further that research was 
something she would never do. It was “beyond her reach and something that only professors 
do... not something that teachers do.” A few preservice elementary teachers implicitly connected 
research to scientific skills and processes. One saw research as beginning with a question, 
collecting data, and analyzing data, working toward a goal. 

It appears preservice elementary teachers hold a variety of myopic views about research as 
they enter the course, but as they reflected upon activities such as interviewing children and doing 
the text evaluation they verbalize changes in their views. They moved away from notions of 
research as a synthesis of knowledge found in books or something only scientists or professors do 
to something that they as teachers can do. Jay who held a “library image of research” revealed a 
change in perspective in the following: 

The textbook analysis doesn’t match up with my previous ideas of research because I was 
doing it myself, I mean, I was taking this book and using my own criteria to judge it by 
and not necessarily what somebody else had set. All I had was this book and I had to 
decide on my own. ..well, as a group we decided on our own how it matched our criteria 
that we came up with ourselves so it is nothing like what I thought about research. When I 
researched [before] it was like you had a question set for you and it told you what to find 
and you had to go out and find it And this way it was like...here’s a book now, do it, 
which was actually better because this way I got to notice my own things instead of having 
to notice what someone else wants me to. 

Debbie reflected upon her changing images in similar ways to Jay in the following: 

We had to stop and think about what would be relevant, what would be important, what 
would be necessary for a textbook. And we were the only resource that we had for 
that...so we had to decide that amongst ourselves, we couldn’t go to a book that said, you 




■618 



595 



know, this is what a textbook is supposed to be like, that’s where we used ourselves as a 
resource. 

Not all preservice elementary teachers found the activity one that prompted change in their notions 
of research. Jose saw the experience through different lenses, he stated that his background in 
science was strong and though the text analysis was beneficial it did not significantly reshape his 
ideas about research. Many of these reflections mirror preservice elementary teachers’ past 
experiences. They recall passively doing “research papers.” Now they are actively “doing 
research.” The pedagogy and philosophy we use in our methods course and its activities are 
designed to challenge prior concepts of research, science, and science teaching using a conceptual 
change approach. Some pro service elementary teachers gain a new awareness and make new 
connections between research, science, and science teaching. This is summarized by Stefan, “It 
was not like any research that I have ever done, it was not big words, going to the library. Science 
to me is, well in this class, I found, is more hands on and the research was that.” 

For some students, there were new understandings about the dilemmas and limitations of 
research. While in the process of generating class criteria for evaluation across the textbooks, the 
preservice elementary teachers decided upon four main areas: pictures, activities, content, and 
organizational layout & terminology. These criteria were determined by stated operational 
definitions quantitatively which any individual in the team could use to get similar results. They 
recognized the need to use criteria that others could use for comparable, reliable results. For 
example, several groups decided to count the numbers of males versus females represented in 
pictures in the texts. Even though they found difficulty with defining other criteria in operational 
terms, they were not willing to give them up. It appears that the struggle to balance what they 
personally felt was important but not readily operationalized quantitatively (i.e. relevant activities 
connected to a child’s experience, alternative extensions across subject areas, visually appealing- 
colorful and exciting, open to alternative assessments, etc.) fostered reflection about the objectivity 
vs. the subjectivity of science and research. 

The following snapshots give insights into personal struggles and solutions to this 
dilemma. Chris wrote, 




This project helped me to see that we are instinctively subjective, but science needs to be 
more objective so that it has universal meaning. I struggled with this because I felt the 
subjective issues were important ones. 

Chris viewed “objective” as quantifiable, but wasn’t willing to give up the criteria whose data was 
not numerical. Clearly she found herself in the midst of the quantitative versus qualitative debate. 
Another student, Debbie reflected on the same issues noting that when she was doing picture 
counts of males vs. females in the text, she found that it wasn’t quite as “black and white” as she 
thought She cited the example that in the text they evaluated, the numbers of males vs. females 
was roughly equivalent, but that the majority of the females were not found until the last quarts’ of 
the book, which she noted, many teachers may never get to before the end of the semester. She 
found the only way to give a clear picture of the gender balance in the book was to include with the 
totals a descriptive section of data, presenting her findings she previously mentioned. Jen also 
found the the nonnumerical criteria challenging, recognizing that by its nature is one that could be 
open to multiple interpretations. She stated: 

When I was writing my individual accountability paps, I was surprised at how many real 
life applications I found. Really, many aspects of science can be related to children’s lives 
in some way. It was interesting to hear how other people did their evaluations. Everyone 
approaches things in different ways. It’s neat to see how one thing can be seen in so many 
different ways. 

In the words of Cochran-Smith & Lytle (1993), “Whs teachers conduct research 
themselves, they make problematic what they think they know, what they see whs they 
observe...and what they do with the disjunctures” (p.64). For our preservice elementary teachers, 
the “disjunctures” were finding ways to maintain within their research those criteria that wse not 
easily quantifiable and more descriptive in nature. They find themselves struggling with the same 
issues researchers across the disciplines face. As with any research endeavor, the choices and the 
selection of important elements interface with the human factor to create a research design that is 
relevant and important to those doing it In their defiance to not give up the less quantifiable 
criteria, the preservice teachers were thrust into the realm of qualitative research to seek resolution 
to some of the disjunctures in their textbook analysis.

As participants in this research we find ourselves guided by the words of Boomer (1987) 
who argues that “to learn deliberately is to research.” Preservice elementary teachers here appear 
deliberate in thoughts about their own learning and the knowledge they possess. They clearly state 
what they know and how they came to know. It is a vital critical connection between the knower 
and the known. The connection becomes the initial step in conceptual change-facing your prior 
notions while restructuring new and more complete concepts. This is a novel way of knowing and 
according to Cochran-Smith and Lytle (1993), it is learning that does not necessarily involve new 
information but rather interprets information one already has— what she calls “REsearching” 
(Berthoff, 1987). Teacher research and research in teaching has the potential to challenge the 
predominant views of preservice education as a transmission model of knowledge by providing 
opportunities for the generation of knowledge through problematic inquiry within the various 
stages of becoming and being a teacher (Cochran-Smith and Lytle, 1993). 

Importance of the Group Process 

The use of group design for this project came as a result of having limited numbers of 
textbooks as well as a need to provide a supportive mechanism for the text evaluation project This 
strategy brings up its own set of dilemmas and solutions by team members. The importance of the 
group process is described in part by false starts and unexpected turns in accomplishing their 
goals. Reconstructions here as elsewhere in this paper are tentative, unclosed and open to 
variables left unmentioned or unobserved. Fifteen teams were formed for the text evaluation and 
as part of the documentation, their decisions and decision making processes were included in the 
reports. Numerous data sources revealed that the preservice teachers felt that group dynamics were 
a central component in the development and conduct of the text analysis. 

The actual process of analyzing the textbooks began as members of teams chose areas to 
evaluate determined by their preference and perceptions of the difficulty of the analysis (based on 
amount of time and effort). Equal work and effort were central to decision making. For instance, 
the following clips are representative of the preservice elementary teacher’s documentations. 

Joshua described the process in these words, “We decided as a group who would do each part, 
giving everyone equal work loads. We decided to do a more elaborate check on one another as a 
change in our design.” Alexandria documented the process in the following way, “First, we let 
whoever wanted to do an area do that area. On the basis of equity, we determined that by how 




598 



much material needed to be covered. For example, the content seemed to be more material than the 
rest, so we had two people work on this area.” 

Other issues of the group process surfaced in the following reflections. For example, 

Chris wrote in ho- journal, 

I learned that working with a team takes time. Everyone must contribute in order for 
everything to come together. I think we came close to this. ... When working 
in a group, it is so important to have those operational definitions so that 
everyone is on the “same page” so to speak. Even though subjectivity is 
important to everyone, it is crucial to have objectivity when working in a group, 
otherwise there would be too many discrepancies. 

Darcy found the negotiation of meaning challenging and exciting. She expressed that, 

The feature most important was realizing that this process was universal in meaning. This 
activity challenges the minds of an entire group, forcing them to come together as a unit. 
The one part of our group that I liked best was how each of us challenged each other’s 
thoughts and made us back up our finding with an explanation. Terrific! ! ! 

The documentation of the process revealed the issue of time being a critical component for the 
project by every group. The preservice teachers also reported that working toward consensus 
regarding the operational definitions of criteria was demanding, frustrating, and sometimes difficult 
to surmount Continued communication among team members fostered a collaborative spirit 
whereby working definitions for data collection emerged. 

There were groups in which the dynamics were not seen in a positive light. Some group 
assessments revealed tensions regarding individuals who were perceived by team members as not 
doing their jobs nor meeting their deadlines. In analyzing the dynamics within the two (out of a 
total of 15) groups that experienced difficulties, some patterns began to emerge. Field 
observations and informal conversations revealed that members within these two groups exhibited 
a tremendous diversity. In one group, there was an older married non-traditional student 
(returning to school after a hiatus), a male that described himself as a non -conformist (relishing in 
doing things that provoked response, like wearing his hair in pigtails and coming to class 
barefooted), one student who was openly very dedicated to his Fundamentalist Christian beliefs, a 
more traditional female student and a student that was experiencing personal problems and ended 



up not working with the group at all. The second group consisted of a single mother, a student 
who was also experiencing personal difficulties, a lone male that kept himself somewhat separated 
from the other group members, a female who was an only child and admitted to finding it difficult 
to work within a group setting, as well as two traditional female students. 

A lack of communication seemed to be a pivotal contributor to tension within the groups. 
Debbie, a nontraditional and verbal member of the group voiced her concerns stating, 

They just didn’t seem really interested in it..I don’t think that they took it seriously 
enough and uh...I never did get it and I never did ask (she chuckles, ruefully). I didn’t 
want to say what I was thinking, but the day before what really made me mad was the first 
time we met, Doug told me 3 or 4 times, now don’t forget to be here tomorrow and he’s 
telling me and then he doesn’t even show up! And the next time I saw him, I said well, 
you weren’t there, so this is what we told you to do, this is what you’re doing and he said 
ok...no, oh God, I’m sorry.. .my car broke down or my house burned down...nothing, no 
explanation.. .just well, I knew you guys’ d take care of it... that seemed to be the attitude of 
both of them. 

Stephanie, another member of the same group wrote in her journal, “I don’t feel that our group 
analyzed our series very closely as a group [sic]. The other groups seemed a lot more ‘tight’ with 
each other...Was it obvious in our presentation that none of us were very close?!” In the groups 
that experienced difficulties, this ‘tightness’ was lacking and they never really came together as a 
group, though each managed to produce an acceptable analysis of the text they were given. 
Contrast this to a comment made by Jason, a student in a group that functioned very effectively 
together: 

We didn’t have a difficult time, we just jumped right into it and got started, (interviewer 
asked why he thought that this was) We all got along, we knew each other, and nobody 
was upset about what they got and we all wanted to work together. We trusted each other 
and were easy going with each other. I think everybody felt like they did an equal amount 
It was hard to get time together.. Jenna had the most difficult schedule so we worked 
around ha- schedule. We thought about not doing this as a group, but we decided to keep 
going.

The groups did have the opportunity to evaluate their team members a part of the process and in 
the 2 groups mentioned previously, the dissatisfaction with how they functioned was evidenced in 
their ratings of each other. Field observations and reflection of the instructors highlight factors in 
group dynamics which seemed to promote collaboration. These included “knowing one another” 
which refers to reciprocal understanding of what team members really think and believe, a personal 
connection between members that extends beyond the classroom, and a tolerance of self and 
others—all of which facilitate ongoing, open communication and a true collaboration. In the groups 
that experienced difficulty, the common thread between them was the inclusion of members, who 
due to personal difficulties, were rendered dysfunctional. It is clear that group members can 
overcome these difficulties if there is an awareness of the circumstances that impact the functioning 
of one within a group. For example, Sarah while discussing her frustrations with a group member 
that failed to complete her portion of the text analysis reflected, 

I realize Terri has personal problems, but I only know that because someone [else] told me. 
Otherwise, I might think that she did not care or was lazy. I wish she would at least say, 
look, I am having some problems, I can write my paper if someone else will type it, 
because I would have. 

Summary and Implications 

If inquiry is to be an integral part of the professional life span of elementary science 
teachers, we need to initiate them into the research process using social and organizational 
structures supportive of be ginnin g teachers’ learning and collaboration (Cochran-S mith and Lytle, 
1993). The research originated with this notion as well as preservice teachers’ requests to examine 
elementary science texts more closely. We provided the supportive social and organizational 
structure, and what unfolded was much more than the simple examination of science texts. 

As this paper suggests, the preservice elementary science teachers found themselves 
examining their skills in working with others to determine what was important to them in 
elementary science textbooks. Reflections of group dynamics revealed notions of trust, 
“tightness,” mutual commitment to a shared goal, and communication as essential elements to 
highly successful team projects. Other teams, recognized that some of their problems stemmed 
from a lack of one or more of these factors and voiced them. As Connor said, “The team provides 
support, but at the same time, pressure to do accurate work.” In the role of researchers, the 




601 



pre service elementary teachers felt the frustration of not knowing where to begin. They reflected 
upon the difficulty of using nonquantifiable criteria, including it despite the challenge it presented. 
Lastly, they felt a satisfaction and “confidence” in designing, conducting, and completing an 
endeavor that generated knowledge that was valuable to them. Every group reported a high degree 
of confidence in their textbook results, while including ways to improve the research. In this 
moment, they became reflective practitioners. 

In addition, as researchers of our own practice, the exploration of how preservice 
elementary teachers interpret the events surrounding their research of elementary science textbooks 
was especially pertinent to us. Pre service elementary teachers were undergoing self critique 
regarding the assumptions they held of research, science and elementary science teaching. Their 
images of research, science, and the roles of elementary science teachers changed. Within a 
conceptual change framework, examining their early perceptions allowed them to challenge their 
assumptions and open themselves up for a broader vision of what they can be and do. This 
represents the initial stage in conceptual change whereby individuals recognize and challenge the 
inadequacy of their understandings. Though there was some resistance the teaching methodologies 
utilized in this process, overall the preservice teachers reported a sense of accomplishment and 
confidence in their products as well as a positive response to the teaching strategies utilized. The 
immersion into the text analysis project offered them opportunities to restructure their conceptual 
understandings of research, science, and science teaching by providing meaningful alternatives for 
understanding, as well as useful applications within the realm of education. 

As preservice elementary science educators, we too, examined our own underlying 
assumptions of what preservice elementary education is and what it should be. Our discomfort 
came from resisting the traditional expectations, recognizing the potential of being blasted by 
student evaluations and accusations of not teaching them anything of value. It would tetve been 
easier to give them guidelines, but we persisted in being part of the change. Change is difficult, 
even for those willing to change because they face moment to moment decisions that influence their 
perceived roles and those of their students. This recognition made us tentative and uncomfortable, 
but at the same time was empowering, as we shed the “false consciousness” that limits how we 
perceive our roles and expectations. We had accepted the “given” that beginning preservice 
elementary teachers have so much to learn regarding science and science teaching that they don’t

have time to explore their chosen practice as a researcher. We challenged this “given” by 
embedding the researcher role within the structure of activities included in the science methods 
course. We found this invaluable. Preservice elementary teachers made the connection that what 
they were doing was research and were aware of the power within it This has wider implications 
for reform and change in education. Before reform is systemic, it must take place on many fronts 
simultaneously. We, as university science educators represent only one front Research in 
science teaching and learning should be informed by all those in the profession who work within 
these fronts. This includes inservice teachers, student teachers, preservice teachers, 
administrators, and university educators. When these professionals merge research findings they 
will produce a knowledge base that will be greater than anything we presently have regarding the 
preparation of science teachers and their continued progress within the profession. 

In closing, in a publication of the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education, 
Knowledge Base far the Beginning Teachers, Reynolds, (1989) said: 

Knowledgeable teachers are not technicians, but professionals worthy and able to make 
reflective decisions or judgments and plans based upon principled knowledge that is 
adapted to the particulars of their teaching situations, their students, their unique 
experiences, their special insights, self knowledge, values, and commitments (Cochran- 
Smith and Lytle, 1993, p. 41). 

Reynolds portrays our view of science teacher education and the words implicitly suggest a 
journey that must start early within teacher preparation. Offering opportunities for preservice 
elementary science teachers to do research, within university teacher preparation programs, can 
provide them with a way of generating knowledge while fostering a confidence in knowing that is 
their own. Therefore, “REsearch” becomes the intellectual tool that informs perceptions of their 
roles in teaching science to children that resists the traditional viewpoints and embraces change 
through their own critical inquiries.

ENHANCING UNDERGRADUATE SCIENCE INSTRUCTION 
THROUGH SCIENCE EDUCATION PARTNERSHIPS: THE G-STEP MODEL 



William F McComas, The University of Southern California 
Anne Marshall Cox, The University of Southern California 

It is common practice, particularly in research-oriented higher education institutions, to 
employ graduate students as teaching assistants whose responsibilities involve instructing 
undergraduate science laboratory classes and facilitating discussion sections. Unfortunately, most 
of these teaching assistants (TAs) have little or no preparation for their roles as instructors and 
have varying levels of experience and background (Nyquist & Wulff, 1996). This lack of 
preparation may explain why many first year graduate students in the sciences are apprehensive 
about their initial teaching assignments (Allen & Rueter, 1990). 

Pickering (1983) outlines both advantages and disadvantages of having TAs instruct 
undergraduate courses. Advantages include the ability to offer smaller class sizes and the 
realization that graduate TAs often identify better with undergraduate students, and therefore, 
serve as strong motivators. However, disadvantages often include the lack of competence due to 
inadequate teaching skills. In addition, most classes conducted by teaching assistants involve 
lecture-oriented instruction since the only teacher training comes from the modeling of their 
professors Since many TAs will become professors, an effective and positive experience as a 
teaching assistant may help support these professors-in-training for their future roles. 

To address these vital issues of TA training and instruction, manuals (McKeachie, 1986; 
Nyquist & Wulff, 1996) and training seminars (Gilreath & Slater, 1994; Lawrenz, Heller, Keith, & 
Heller, 1992) have been proposed and many institutions require that TAs attend some form of 
orientation program before taking positions as instructors. As shown in Table 1, the nature of the 
help and support provided to teaching assistants in general varies widely depending on the 



university or academic department. This chart is derived from the literature relating to the 
training of teaching assistants in many disciplines, but will be discussed from the perspective of 
science education. The levels represent our view of the kind of increased support that should 
result in higher degrees of teaching competency.

The laissez-faire approach exists when there is no formal training offered by either the 
university or individual science departments. Students are forced to draw upon their previous 
experiences and the expectations and examples of colleagues. Unfortunately this common 
practice often results from the widespread belief that anyone can teach if they know the content or 
that pedagogy is not something that can be learned. The next level involves the delivery of 
generic workshops, usually for a few days at the beginning of each academic year. These 
workshops are often conducted by the university for all TAs, regardless of their future assignment 
or responsibilities. The third level, the discipline-specific workshop, is often designed by individual 
departments such as the biological or physical sciences. TAs are required to attend a series of 
workshops related to their own discipline focusing on specific procedures and expectations that 
should be followed during the year. These workshops may range from generic safety issues to 
delivering laboratory instruction. The fourth level, professor-specific mentoring is patterned after 



the apprenticeship model, where TAs work closely with an individual professor. At this level, 
professors become colleagues with their teaching assistants and help these young instructors 
become both professional researchers and effective teachers. The final level involves the formation 
of partnerships between science education students who have experience in science teaching 
methods. These science education students offer instructional support and mentoring to TAs 
during an academic year. This is the model we will present in this analysis. 

Although the ideal TA program would incorporate a variety of assistance modes, little 
systematic research exists to show how TAs are best trained and which training schemes are most 
effective. In one study, Lawrenz, et al (1992) found that a discipline-specific physics training 
program resulted in high student satisfaction for sections of courses taught by trained teaching 
assistants. As part of the training, TAs attended instructional seminars focusing on cooperative 
learning techniques and constructivist approaches for teaching physical science. Although 
pedagocial issues were addressed, these TAs did not experience discipline-specific guidance or 
science education mentoring, nor did they have an opportunity to collaborate with science 
educators. 

Nyquist, Abbott, Wulff, and Sprague (1991) described indicators of TA developmental 
stages in the process of moving from novice to professional levels, as a teacher or scholar. They 
named these stages the Senior Learner, Colleague-in-Training, and Junior Colleague. The ultimate 
goal is that each TA reach the Junior Colleague stage and demonstrate reflective thought about 
students and instruction, exhibit professional actions and attitudes toward students and engage in 
collegial discourse with authority. Nyquist and Wulff (1996) outlined ways of helping students 
reach the Junior Colleague stage by learning their specific discipline and engaging in professional 
dialogue and collaborative projects; however, methodological issues were not addressed. The 




608 



formation of partnerships with science education students coupled with pedagogical seminars may 
provide the missing link when helping TAs move toward the goal of becoming junior colleagues. 
The Graduate Science Teacher Enhancement Program (G-STEP) Model 

Overview 

In recognition of the limitations found in those few teaching assistant training programs 
that have been reported, coupled with the fact that many TAs aspire to become effective 
instructors, we have designed, implemented, and evaluated an innovative model to assist TAs with 
the instructional aspects of their university experience. The G-STEP (Graduate Science Teaching 
Assistant Enhancement Program) is a unique project designed to provide formal opportunities to 
engage in professional experiences by linking science teaching assistants with science education 
majors. 

The goals of G-STEP include: 

1) Enhancing undergraduate instruction while helping science teaching assistants and 
science education graduate students develop as professionals; 

2) Providing science education graduate students experience as mentors; 

3) Introducing science TAs to current science education research and instructional 
methodology; 

4) Creating collegial partnerships between science education students and teaching 
assistants from university science departments. 

As illustrated in Figure 1, the G-STEP model is somewhat complex with participation 

from education faculty and students and teaching assistants from various science departments. 

The roles and responsibilities of each of the key people involved are discussed in the following 

sections.

Half-dav Workshops 

The most formal element of the G-STEP model includes a series of half day workshops, 
held on Saturdays, conducted by the first author, a science education professor, who presented 
pedagogical implications of current science education research. Informed by both the needs 
expressed by TAs and current research-based trends in science education, we chose the themes of 
inquiry, teachers' knowledge, constructivism, and presentation skills for the four workshops. 

The inquiry workshop focused on suggestions for enhancing laboratory teaching 
(McComas and Colburn, 1995). This workshop was most appropriate since the majority of the 
teaching assistants have responsibility for instruction in the laboratory environment, although most 
did not have role in selecting or designing the activities themselves. The workshop on the nature 
of teacher's knowledge (Shulman, 1986) was an introduction to the range of issues, experiences 





610 



and information that an effective science instructor should have at his or her command coupled 
with assessment strategies. In the constructivism workshop, we discussed the range of 
possibilities for teaching models including the application of constructivism in instruction (Brooks 
& Brooks, 1993; Tobin, 1993). Finally, the presentation skills session, during interactive 
presentation by an outside specialist, provided opportunities for participants to examine their 
personal learning styles while designing instruction appropriate for the range of such styles 
(Gardner, 1993). Each of these workshops included cooperative learning activities, and the 
discussion of relevant journal articles associated with each topic. They provided opportunities for 
ongoing peer dialogue between science teaching assistants themselves and between science 
teaching assistants and science educators. 

Science Teaching Assistants 

Following the receipt of external funding to support the modest costs of G-STEP, and in 
cooperation with the university office of instructional enhancement, the program was designed 
and invitations were sent to teaching assistants in each of the science departments describing 
general goals and expectations of the program. Interested science teaching assistants completed 
an application which asked for a discussion of prior teaching experiences, reasons for wanting to 
participate G-STEP, and candidates’ personal expectations for the program. Responses to the 
G-STEP application reflected a genuine need for enhanced teaching methods at the undergraduate 
level. For example, one science TA wrote, "Since my ultimate goal is to teach at the college level, 
I would like to do everything possible to enhance my skills as an instructor." Another student 
wrote, "I would like to take advantage of any worthwhile programs offered by the university that 
would allow me to become a more effective teacher. " At the conclusion of the G-STEP program, 
science TAs received a small stipend and a certificate of participation. During its first year, 




611 



G-STEP involved 1 5 teaching assistants from biology, chemistry, and geoscience departments. 
During the second year, G-STEP involved 16 teaching assistants from biology, physics, and the 
geosciences. 

Science Education Graduate Students 

The graduate science education students act as instructional mentors to the teaching 
assistants. Potential mentor participants are experienced classroom teachers in both elementary 
and secondary schools and who completed a formal graduate education course in advanced 
science teaching methods. A central feature of this advanced science teaching methods class 
included a series of activities in which students viewed videotaped presentations of science 
teachers and created assessment schemes based on what research recommends in support of high 
quality science instruction. In addition, several sessions were devoted to methods of clinical 
supervision. These two elements, rationale and research-based observation coupled with clinical 
supervision strategies helped to prepare science education majors to be effective mentors when 
interacting with science teaching assistants. The science education mentors received three units of 
tuition remission for their participation. In its first year, G-STEP involved five science education 
students and four science education mentors in its second year. 

Partnerships: Linking Science Educators with Science Teaching Assistants 

Partnerships between science education students and science TAs are mutually beneficial. 
Not only do TAs gain from the teaching experience and insights from the science education 
majors, but the science educators were able to apply what they learned in class and from their own 
professional experiences by performing authentic clinical supervision and providing peer support. 

Teams were formed consisting of one science education student, and three to five science 
TAs. Teams are generally discipline-specific in reference to the science educator's expertise. This 



was helpful when discussing policies and expectations within specific departments. Each team 
member was assigned specific responsibilities during the year Responsibilities of science 
education mentors and science teaching assistants varied slightly (see table 2). 

Table 2. 

The role and expectations of the science education mentors and the 
science teaching assistants participating in G-STEP. 



Science Education Mentors: 

1) Observe one class during the fall semester and two classes during the spring semester 

2) Organize a pre-conference before each class visit 

3) Plan a post-conference after each observation 

4) Organize two informal seminars for team members 

5) Communicate regularly with team members 

6) Attend and participate in half-day G-STEP workshops 

Science Teaching Assistants: 

1) Work with your mentor/mentors to schedule class visits 

2) Participate in pre-conference and post-conferences 

3) Attend two informal seminars for team members 

4) Communicate regularly with team members 

5) Attend and participate in half-day G-STEP workshops 

Mentoring Opportunities for Science Education Students 

Throughout the academic year, partnerships between science educators and science 
teaching assistants were continually enhanced during the workshops, pre- conferences about 
classroom visits, observations, and post-conferences. Informal seminars also took place each 
semester over lunch, coffee, or in graduate student offices. The purpose of these sessions is to 
discuss reflections from the workshop series, discipline-specific problems in laboratory or 
discussion sessions, or to discuss teaching methodology not covered in the half day workshops. 

Observation pre- and post- conferences were usually conducted individually by education 
mentors and science TAs. Occasionally, more than one mentor observed a lesson and provided 



additional feedback. The purpose of the pre-conference was to discuss what the science TA 
would like the mentor to look for during the classroom obersvation. Since science TAs have 
varying abilities, some participants needed different types of assistance. For example, if the TA 
has difficulty encouraging students to participate during post-lab discussions, the mentor may 
observe the population of students, types of questions being asked, and the seating arrangements 
of students to offer suggestions to help the TA remedy the problem. Suggestions were offered 
during post conferences. 

Translating Knowledge Into Practice: An Evaluation of G-STEP 

Qualitative survey data were collected from both the teaching assistants and science 
education mentors in an attempt to gauge the impact of the program, how G- STEP enhanced 
science instruction, and what areas of the model should be revised. Since surveys were 
anonymous, it is impossible to link application essays with the final survey results, but participants 
were asked to restate their initial goals and indicate the degree to which these goals were met 
during the program. 

Each participant revealed that their goals were met to some degree and many participants 
volunteered that their personal expectations for the program were exceeded. Specific categories 
were generated from these surveys indicating that TAs found five workshop components most 
useful. These included discussions, reviews of teacher videos, discussion of learning styles and 
questioning strategies, and the creation of student-centered learning environments. During each 
workshop, time was allotted for TAs and Science Educators to discuss current topics and share 
problems. Teacher videos were utilized for viewing diverse instructional styles. An introduction to 
various learning styles and questioning strategies was the focus of two different sessions that 
included Gardner’s theory of multiple intelligences and the practice of rephrasing convergent 




614 



questions during lab instruction. Procedures for creating student-centered classrooms were salient 
features at each workshop and pre and post-conferences conducted by science education students. 

The result of G-STEP workshops and mentoring varied in reference to how participants 
applied instructional information to their current teaching position. Three specific categories were 
generated from information provided by TAs commenting on the usefulness of the G-STEP 
experience. Each of these categories corresponded with useful workshop components discussed 
earlier. These categories included Learning Modalities, Student-Centered Labs, and Student 
Collaboration. Participants reported including visual aids, videos, and music in their lessons in 
ways not previously attempted. Student-centered labs entailed less “cook book” type instruction, 
more divergent questions with “wait time”, and more active participation from students. Student 
collaboration was enhanced by encouraging cooperative groups and allowing students to choose 
partners for support. 

Excerpts are included below indicating various methods learned and applied as a result of 
G-STEP. 

TA #1 : "I learned not to give students authoritative ‘correct' answers and allow them to 
think more for themselves ..." 

TA #2: "Wait time — it is not easy, but it really does work!" 

TA #3: "... Using follow-up or closure at (the) end of (a) lab instead of just letting the 
lab end with no recap." 

TA#4: "... I will also apply different methods of teaching to appeal to different methods 
of learning." 

TA #5: "I've tried to give a little less cookbook-type instruction, as suggested This seems 
to work well." 





615 



TA #6: "Active participation, asking questions, and turning some of the responsibility of 
learning on the student." 

Science education students found that they were able to review many important strategies 
and methodologies for teaching science by attending G-STEP workshops. In addition, they 
indicated that the opportunity to gain mentoring experience and to work with science teachers at 
the undergraduate level enriched their development as a science educator. 

Conclusions 

Responses indicate that TAs learned to apply a more interactive style in their laboratory or 
discussion sections and generally broadened their repertoire beyond that typically seen in the 
undergraduate teaching arena. In addition, these science teaching assistants have developed a 
stronger background and rationale for applying various instructional strategies for teaching 
undergraduates. Science education students gained mentor experience which enhanced their 
professional development. 

G-STEP is a model that capitalizes on blending the pedagogical strengths of science 
educators with the content expertise and desire to improve that often reside in science teaching 
assistants. This partnership has been shown to be an important and effective tool in the 
development of science educators as supportive mentors and teaching assistants as the professors 
of tomorrow while improving science instruction at the undergraduate level today.

Abstract 



It is rare that university-based teaching assistants (TAs) attend professional development 
workshops designed to acquaint them with appropriate pedagogical models. Thus, these new 
instructors typically engage in ineffective instructional methods based on their experiences rather 
than on research-based rationales. The poor teaching at universities both by faculty and teaching 
assistants has been widely criticized in spite of some attempts to remedy the situation. This paper 
is the report of a low cost, innovative partnership model, G-STEP (Graduate Science Teaching 
Assistant Enhancement Program), designed to assist both TAs and science educators with 
personal professional growth and to enhance instruction delivered by science teaching assistants.

MR. REINKENS’ NEIGHBORHOOD: CAN YOU SAY 
‘CONCEPTUAL CHANGE?’ 

Valarie L. Dickinson, Oregon State University 
Kirk A. Reinkens, Washington State University 

Introduction 

Current reforms in science education focus on the need for students to 
conceptually understand science rather than knowing a breadth of science facts (AAAS, 
1993; NRC, 1996). These recommendations are for students of all grade levels, from 
Kindergarten through high school and beyond. Understanding science necessitates 
conceptualizing content. To understand science conceptually means to know the ideas of 
science and the relationships between them. It includes knowledge of ways to use the 
ideas to explain and predict other natural phenomena, and ways to apply them to other 
events (NRC, 1996). Developing understanding presupposes that students are actively 
engaged with the ideas of science. The reforms suggest scientific understanding can be 
gained through inquiry instruction generated from student experiences. 

According to Kelly’s (1955) theory of personal constructs, thought processes are 
psychologically developed by experiences that serve to help the person anticipate future 
events. Prior experiences form background knowledge that people use to inform 
inferences made from future experiences. Thus, in any science classroom, it can be 
expected that children will have had experiences that helped them develop stable and 
functional constructs about the world. These constructs, or ideas, will influence 
interpretations made of explorations in science. Children’s ideas are defined as experience- 
based explanations constructed by the learner to make a range of phenomena and objects 




619 



intelligible (Wandersee, Mintzes, & Novak, 1994). Children’s ideas are stable and resistant 
to change (Carey, 1985; Driver, Guesne, & Tiberghien; Novak, 1988; Stepans, 

Beiswinger, & Dyche, 1986). As long as the idea serves the learner in making sense of the 
world, it will remain the learner’s theory (Driver, et al, 1985; Osborne & Freyburg, 1985). 
Children’s ideas develop very early, and by the age of 5 or 6 children have evolved a 
robust and serviceable set of theories about their world (Carey 1985; Gardner, 1991; 
Piaget, 1929). The reforms have recommended conceptual understanding of science. 
However, student ideas will influence their understanding of science concepts. 

Young children’s ideas have been studied for many decades, with Piaget (1929) 
pioneering their study with the development and use of the clinical interview method. 
Science educators have adapted the clinical interview method to explore children’s ideas in 
a plethora of science content areas (Osborne & Freyburg, 1985; Posner & Gertzog, 1982; 
Thier, 1967). Results of the study of children’s ideas show that school children can 
proceed through their school careers and retain misconceptions about many science 
concepts (Anderson & Smith, 1986; Bar, 1989; Bishop & Anderson, 1990; Griminelli 
Tomasini, Gandolfi, & Pecordi Balandi, 1990; Hashweh, 1988; Hesse & Anderson, 1992; 
Nussbaum & Novak, 1976). The kinds of science instruction children are receiving do not 
seem to be effective in helping students change their conceptions toward the scientific 
convention. Students may be presented with evidence that their ideas are incongruent 
with an experiment or problem and reject the evidence, or reinterpret it differently within 
their own beliefs (Osborne & Freyburg, 1985). Even when students present what appear 
to be correct responses, they continue to harbor their own ideas (Driver, et al, 1985; 
Erlwanger, 1975; Herscovics, 1989; Osborne & Freyburg, 1985). Perhaps instruction has 




620 



been ineffective in changing children’s ideas because, though there have been many 
studies delineating the kinds of ideas children hold, there has been little impact of these 
ideas on classroom practice (Hewson, Bell, Griminelli Tomasini, Pecordi Balandi, 
Hennessey, & Zeitsman, 1995). The impact of children’s ideas on classroom practice 
should be studied to see whether knowledge of students’ ideas can influence teacher 
practice. Teachers with knowledge of student ideas may be influenced to develop 
instructional activities that would help students’ ideas move toward scientific conceptions. 

What is necessary to help children’s ideas develop toward the scientific convention 
and the visions of the reforms? Posner, Strike, Hewson, and Gertzog (1982) theorize that 
students will remain committed to their ideas unless they are shown the necessity of their 
modification. The student must be dissatisfied with the existing conception, meaning the 
child’s idea must no longer make sense to the child in explaining the concept. A new idea 
must be intelligible as well as plausible. Finally, the conception must be fruitful, and make 
sense in many situations. Strike and Posner (1992) reiterated that their theory of 
conceptual change is not a prescription for instruction, but only conditions necessary for 
ideas to change. A possible way for teachers to help students change ideas would be to 
scaffold them to a more accurate level of understanding (Rogoff, 1990; Vygotsky, 1991). 

There are many factors that influence teaching elementary science. These factors 
are: (a) teacher perception of the importance of science in an elementary curriculum, (b) 
limited content knowledge held by elementary teachers, and (c) limited experience through 
formal coursework in participating in and presenting, hands-on science. Elementary 
teachers do not often see science as a pertinent topic, but rather as something to be taught 
only when other subjects have been covered (Abell & Roth, 1992; Schoeneberger & 





621 



Russell, 1986; Tilgner, 1990; Tobin, Briscoe & Holman, 1990). Administrators do not 
always see science as an important subject in elementary schools (Schoeneberger & 
Russell, 1986; Tilgner 1990). Seeing science as of little importance leads to less funding 
and support of elementary science (Stefanich, 1992). Because of lower funding, 
elementary teachers are likely to have inadequate equipment for teaching science. 
Inadequate equipment and limited time often inhibit teachers from providing in-depth 
instruction (Stefanich, 1992; Tilgner, 1990). 

Elementary teachers lack confidence in their abilities to teach science due to weak 
content knowledge (Borko, 1993; Enochs & Riggs, 1990; Smith & Neale, 1989). Even 
elementary science enthusiasts who effectively teach concepts for which they have good 
background knowledge, have difficulty teaching other science concepts because of 
inadequate content knowledge (Abell & Roth, 1 992). Lack of confidence and content 
knowledge is likely not unique to science, but in other curricular areas as well. 

Elementary teachers often have not had experience participating in hands-on 
science, and therefore are unsure of how it should proceed in their own classrooms 
(Bybee, 1993). Typically elementary teachers take introductory science courses in then- 
teacher preparation programs, yet those courses often do not suit their needs or interests 
(Tobias, 1992). Even elementary teachers with a positive attitude and interest in learning 
science may find college science coursework inhibiting to their learning (Dickinson & 
Flick, 1996). Given the numerous barriers to teaching science, compounded with lack of 
administrative support, it is impressive that many elementary teachers forge ahead and 
provide effective instruction. 




622 



Despite these constraints, elementary teachers are recommended to teach science 
for conceptual understanding (AAAS, 1993; NRC, 1996). The question is how we can 
best help elementary teachers provide the most effective instruction for their students, that 
would lead to better science achievement in the elementary grades. It is necessary to 
know what kinds of knowledge about teaching science to children would allow teachers to 
meet the science standards at the primary and elementary grade levels. 

Method 

Subjects 

This case study investigated the efforts of one preservice elementary teacher in his 
efforts to effect conceptual change in his intern setting. The preservice teacher selected 
did not have as many constraints to his teaching of science as other elementary teachers 
may have. He had strong content knowledge, holding a bachelor’s degree in electrical 
engineering, with six years of research experience. He was in a preservice teaching 
placement that valued and supported his strength in science. In addition, the subject had a 
strong interest in implementing conceptual change in his fifth-grade internship placement. 
He had a background in conceptual change research literature, and was using that 
education to design ways to know students’ conceptions, strategies he could use to help 
change those ideas, and ways to assess conceptual change. 

Kirk was enrolled in a Master’s in Teaching program, and earned a Master’s 
degree in teaching, as well as a K-8 initial teaching certificate. He was required to 
produce and defend a final research project on his teaching. He chose to see whether he 
could create a “Neighborhood of Science” in his internship position. “Neighborhood of 



Science” referred to establishing a community of learners for which science was the focus 
of the classroom. Kirk sought to know how he could identify student conceptions, create 
activity and interactions that challenged their ideas, and evaluate student progress toward 
scientific conceptions within the neighborhood of science. 

The class in which Kirk was placed for his internship was a fifth grade self- 
contained room in a middle class neighborhood. There were 23 students in the class, 1 1 
girls, and 12 boys. The supervising teacher had 10 years of teaching experience, mostly at 
the fifth grade level. She had no expertise or interest in science. Her teaching of science 
was not observed as part of this project. However, Kirk described her as having a “well- 
oiled? class, with excellent classroom management skills and the ability to keep students 
actively engaged in the activities at hand or working on assignments with little 
distractions. Kirk also stated she was delighted to have a science person in her classroom. 
In fact, the teachers in her school decided to capitalize on Kirk’s science background and 
interest, and requested he develop the Chemistry Unit for fifth grade. Kirk seized this 
opportunity as a way to allow him to develop and teach a unit he believed would influence 
conceptual change. This event allowed him to include in the unit the elements he believed 
to be important in knowing student conceptions, planning activities and interactions that 
would lead to conceptual change, and in assessing student ideas. 

Data Collection 

As Kirk engaged in his own investigation of his teaching, an outside researcher, 
not currently in connection with the university at which Kirk was enrolled, studied the 
methods developed and used by him. The data collection period took place over the 
1995-1996 school year, as Kirk began planning to teach for conceptual change, and 




624 



concluding with his assessment of his success. The data collection instalments included: 
(1) email correspondence tracking the development of the conceptual change chemistry 
unit, (2) interviews of the teacher’s views of conceptual change and science teaching, (3) 
videotapes of six episodes of the teacher’s science teaching, (4) a collection of journal 
reflections by the teacher, (5) copies of student journals and student work, (6) a copy of 
the teacher’s report of his analysis of the effectiveness of his conceptual change strategy. 

Data collection began with Kirk’s planning for influencing conceptual change 
during his internship. Kirk contacted the researcher via electronic mail with a request for 
assistance in planning his conceptual change unit. Subsequent weekly email 
correspondence and journal reflections were shared between the researcher and teacher. 

In addition, four face-to-face interview meetings took place. Notes were made of 
interactions between the researcher and preservice teacher during the meetings. At the 
meetings Kirk was interviewed for his ideas about conceptual change and science 
teaching, and the progress he was making. Because the researcher provided Kirk with 
input in conceptual change teaching during his planning, this is a limitation of the study. 
Kirk may have designed his unit differently had he not made and maintained contact with 
the researcher. 

Data Analysis — the researcher 

Data analysis began with an examination of all data collected, using 
correspondence and teacher journal entries as the primary sources, and observations, 
interview, and student work as secondary sources. Triangulation of these sources provided 
protection against threats of validity. The researcher searched for patterns within the data 
using a constant comparative method (Taylor & Bogdan, 1984). The data was then 




625 



categorized as patterns emerged. By a constant comparison of incidents in the data 
sources the researcher refined the concepts and explored their relationships to one 
another. The concepts were then integrated into a whole picture of the teacher’s method 
of identifying student ideas. The researcher searched for evidence of (1) conceptual 
change teaching, (2) uncovering student ideas, (3) assessing student conceptual change. 

As a final step in the data analysis the researcher engaged in discounting the data 
(Taylor & Bogdan, 1984). In the process of discounting, the data were looked at in the 
context of which they were collected. Data that was solicited and unsolicited were 
identified as such. Unsolicited responses from the teacher were viewed as valuable in 
determining how the teacher was identifying student ideas, or in leading to explaining any 
trouble with identifying ideas in a classroom setting. Next, the researcher’s effects on the 
teacher were identified. It was presumed the researcher would have some effect on the 
teacher, since the teacher sought out the researcher with the purpose of receiving input on 
the design of his conceptual change teaching. The researcher’s effect on the teacher was 
described. Finally, the researcher’s comments and observations were noted as such in the 
body of the data collection, in particular field notes, as “O. C.” The notation allowed the 
researcher to identify any personal observations, and when analyzing the data, to 
differentiate personal notes and inferences from actual observations. 

Data Analysis — the preservice teacher 

Kirk engaged in his own data analysis process. He kept his own journal of 
reflections on his teaching and its effectiveness. In his journal he recorded observations of 
his students, his thoughts while reading students’ work, his thoughts while viewing 
videotapes of his teaching, and comments made by students to him as they worked. He 





626 



also recorded his decision-making process for selecting activities, and daily and weekly 
reviews of entries that discussed project progress and notable data. These journal entries 
were shared with the researcher. Kirk used this data to assess student feelings about the 
“Neighborhood of Science,” and changes in their ideas about chemistry concepts. 

Data analysis included reviewing and coding all data as they were related to the research 
questions set out by the preservice teacher. Some data were used to address more than 
one research question. The research questions for the preservice teacher were: 

1. How do my teaching methods contribute to my students’ comfort levels in the 
neighborhood of science? 

2. Which classroom activities are effective and contribute to the neighborhood of 
science? 

3. How do my teaching methods contribute to achieving conceptual change? 

4. How effective am I at identifying and addressing students’ misconceptions? 

5. What types of activities promote students to change their conceptions of a science 



Comparisons were made of the researcher’s and teacher’s analyses of the teacher’s 
effectiveness at influencing conceptual change in students. Any discrepancies were 
analyzed for their differences.

a description of the preservice teacher’s analyses is discussed. Third, a comparison of the 
researcher and preservice teacher’s results is reported. 

Researcher Observations 

Several patterns have emerged indicating the areas Kirk believed were important in 
influencing conceptual change in his students. First, Kirk was very concerned with student 
ideas about chemistry throughout the entire project. Concern and awareness of the 
importance of knowing student ideas began with his proposal for his Master’s in Teaching 
research project. He wrote: 

They (teachers) need to be continuously aware of student conceptions, methods, 
and activities for addressing those conceptions, and recording student work and 
achievement. It is also the responsibility of the teacher to ensure that these phases 
of instruction are presented in a manner which is helpful in promoting the 
conditions identified as necessary for conceptual change by Posner, et al. 

Kirk’s concern with student ideas and wish to help students develop their ideas 
began with his planning of the unit, proceeded through the implementation of the unit, and 
continued during the assessment of students and his own success with the unit. Kirk used 
several methods to help him know his students’ ideas. He used journal entries to 
encourage students to write about their individual ideas, class discussions to encourage 
exploration of ideas together, questioning techniques to help students focus on their ideas, 
and hands-on activities to help them confront their ideas. 

However, Kirk was confronted with the difficulty of getting students who were 
accustomed to parroting back information to think about, and share their ideas, about 




628 



what they were learning. He was frustrated at their unwillingness to discuss their ideas. 
This frustration was evident in Kirk’s journal entry about his first day of teaching (Feb. 1): 
Getting their ideas. Yeah, right! That’s just sarcasm. I’m not so sure if it is 
getting their ideas or observations in this case. I really emphasized I wanted their 
ideas while we were doing experiments. Most don’t seem to be sure they have 
ideas of chemistry at all. They appear to be looking for someone to give them the 
answer so they can learn it? 

Kirk was sometimes less than pleased with the journal responses. Though he 
promised students As on their journals if they discussed their ideas, only some students 
explained their ideas in writing. For students who did not describe their thinking, Kirk did 
not give As. Students received as low as D- on their journal entries. To encourage these 
students to share more about their own ideas, Kirk would ask questions such as “what do 
you think happened,” and “why did you think that happened?” In later journal entries Kirk 
showed increased frustration at not getting students to describe their ideas. He wrote 
comments on student journal entries such as “you must tell me what you saw, “ or “you 
must explain why you think it happened.” Though the journal assignments were 
successful in getting some students to share their ideas in writing, they were not effective 
for all students. 

Class discussions were another means for Kirk to identify student ideas. He 
presented topics for discussion, and asked students to respond with their ideas. During 
one such discussion, students described what they thought the difference was between 
physical and chemical change. Kirk was careful to accept all student ideas and wrote 



student responses on an overhead transparency. He did not reinforce “correct” ideas, nor 
reprimand those that were “incorrect.” He hoped by accepting all ideas he would 
encourage more students to share their true conceptions. Following the collection of 
student ideas about physical and chemical change, students were asked to think of 
examples of where they had seen these changes, and how they could identify the type of 
change. Kirk believed students would better express their true ideas if they related them 
to what they encountered in their daily lives. Students came up with many examples, some 
of which were not scientifically accurate. Kirk used these ideas to plan activities to help 
students become better at identifying the differences, and in explaining why certain 
changes were chemical while others were physical. 

Kirk planned daily explorations he hoped would encourage students to confront 
their ideas. Keeping with the spirit of the “neighborhood of science, usually these 
activities were collaborative investigations. While students were engaged in activities, Kirk 
would circulate the room, asking students to explain why they thought they were 
obtaining their results. This was in direct contrast to the supervising teacher, who often 
circulated the room while Kirk was teaching, but only asked students to explain what 
happened, not to offer explanations for why it happened. Kirk’s requirements for students 
to justify their responses encouraged students to think about their data, and confront then- 
ideas. It also enabled Kirk to note any erroneous ideas, and take them into account when 
planning future activities and interactions. 

Preservice Teacher Observations 

Kirk divided his analysis into areas addressing his research questions. He 
addressed his first two questions in the first section. He explained how his teaching 







630 



methods contributed to student confidence and comfort in the neighborhood of science, 
and which classroom activities he found to be effective in creating a neighborhood of 
science. He then addressed research results for his final three questions. In this section he 
discussed how his teaching methods contributed to student conceptual change, his 
effectiveness at identifying and addressing students’ conceptions, and the types of 
activities that promote students to change their conceptions. 

Research Questions One and Two 

Kirk found data describing the strategies he chose to develop a neighborhood of 
science, and student feelings and attitudes toward the unit. He also searched for data 
pointing to the effectiveness of his chosen strategies, and suggested alternatives that may 
be even better at contributing to a neighborhood of science. 

Kirk believed data showed he had a strong desire to make students feel 
comfortable sharing their ideas. He consistently gave students the opportunity to share 
their ideas without judgment concerning the scientific accuracy of their statements. He 
strongly believed effective oral and written communication in the room was necessary to 
foster comfort and confidence in science. Kirk focused on getting students to phrase 
questions concerning the science content to allow them to develop their understandings. 
He shares one student’s question: “How did they come up with the model [of the atom] 
since it can’t be seen?” 

He believed this willingness to phrase questions showed students’ comfort in 
sharing ideas. He also believed this question would not be as readily asked in a classroom 
that used a didactic approach because students would focus more on presenting the 
answer they thought the teacher wanted. His focus for developing a comfortable and 




631 



sharing “neighborhood of science” was open communication in the room. He noted that 
most students seemed comfortable and confident when sharing their descriptions of 
concepts and models. 

Research Questions 3. 4 and 5. 

Kirk had more difficulty searching the data for descriptions of conceptual change. 
To set up his conceptual change unit, he arranged activities to move from the observable 
concepts of chemical and physical change to abstract concepts like molecular and atomic 
structure. Students observed and recorded a variety of chemical reactions, and then 
shared their explanations for those reactions. Students were then introduced to the 
accepted models of chemical theory. Students were then given time to review the 
experiments and modify their ideas. 

Kirk was unsure of his success at influencing conceptual change. He thought 
perhaps students were undergoing a development of a concept, rather than a change in 
conception. He believed they had such little background knowledge in chemistry that he 
was helping them build, rather than change, a concept. He found it difficult to assess the 
success of his conceptual change methods because he was not sure whether his methods 
were in fact, influencing conceptual change. 

To improve on his methods at identifying student ideas and changing conceptions, 
he recommends using student journals in a different way. He thinks if they were more 
open-ended and required justifications for student predictions he would have a: 

better picture of what students think, and a better feel for their prior knowledge. 
By helping students improve their communication skills in science I can help them 
incorporate new concepts more readily. 



Kirk also recommends two other methods that would further influence conceptual 
change. First, allowing students to do more of the experimentation on their own, rather 
than having many teacher demonstrations. While this would require specific lab training 
for students, the time involved would likely be well worthwhile. Second, having students 
make oral or video reports of their work would encourage them to share their ideas as a 
group, and to become better communicators of scientific ideas. 

Comparison of Researcher and Teacher Analysis 

How effective was the teacher at identifying student ideas, and assessing change in 
ideas? The researcher believed the preservice teacher was somewhat successful at 
identifying student ideas. When asked, he was unable to provide examples of specific 
misconceptions held by his students. The inability to furnish specific examples could 
indicate he was not wholly successful at eliciting, or recognizing, student ideas. However, 
he was able to share butcher paper lists of ideas students had shared during discussions, 
indicating he had collected these ideas. As a preservice teacher, Kirk did have several 
constraints. He was constrained by time, having only three weeks to identify ideas, teach 
to change those ideas, and then to assess whether he had been successful. It is unlikely 
students would undergo substantial conceptual change in such a time period. Students in 
this class were not accustomed to sharing their ideas. Their reluctance to share ideas 
created a stumbling block at the outset, making it more difficult for Kirk to influence 
conceptual change in a short time period. In addition, due to being in a classroom not his 
own, he was constrained by the amount of time he could spend on science each day. 



Kirk himself, was confused as to whether he was focusing on changing 
conceptions, or on just helping students develop conceptions about chemistry. In his final 
report assessing his effectiveness Kirk wrote: 

I found that teaching for conceptual change is influenced by many things, 
including, but not limited to: the topic or concept under investigation, the 
students’ ability to communicate their conceptions effectively, my own “on the 
spot” and journal response questioning skills, and my knowledge of the material. 

Kirk spoke of being a little shaky in content knowledge regarding student ideas of 
chemical change. He felt he did not always know whether the examples given by the 
students were scientifically accurate. Upon reflection, he believed he could compensate 
for his perceived weakness in content knowledge by having students help him determine 
the scientifically appropriate answer. 

He believed that creation of a “neighborhood of science” within which students are 
comfortable and willing to share ideas and inferences is central to changing student 
conceptions. Both the researcher and teacher agree that Kirk emphasized students sharing 
their ideas, and that helping students become effective communicators will provide much 
needed information for the teacher in identifying student ideas and planning activities to 
confront them, and in helping students become more comfortable in their own abilities to 
understand and explain scientific concepts. 





634 



Conclusions and Implications 



Kirk, a preservice teacher with limited teaching experience, demonstrated an ability 
to develop an environment during which many students felt comfortable sharing their 
ideas. His success implies that given the drive and knowledge base, a relatively 
inexperienced teacher can create a classroom environment consistent with the reforms that 
allows students to share their ideas and engage in inquiry. It implies that preservice 
teachers can be aware of the importance of knowing student ideas, and that they can 
develop and carry out their own plans for influencing those ideas. 

If a preservice teacher can invoke such an environment in a short period of time, 
experienced teachers with more background and knowledge of pedagogy and content, and 
perhaps pedagogical content knowledge (Shulman, 1986), may be even more successful in 
developing their own methods of identifying student ideas. 

Kirk’s awareness of children’s ideas influenced his teaching in the areas of planning 
to identify those ideas, and planning to change those ideas. He sought out student ideas to 
inform his own teaching practice. He sought to use individual writing assignments and 
group discussions to identify and assess changes in ideas. He did not use individual 
interviews, nor pre- and post-tests to identify and assess those ideas. His choice to use 
methods that are different than those typically used by researchers implies that teachers 
may develop their own strategies that fit their students and teaching situations. Individual 
teachers may identify and address children’s ideas in different ways.

Further Development of a Comprehensive Undergraduate Science 
Education Program for Elementary and Middle School Teachers

In the November 1996 issue of NSTA Reports!, under the headlines Basic College Science 
Courses Filter Out Most Students, Says New NSF Report , the NSTA quotes the recently released 
NSF report, Shaping the Future: New Expectations for Undergraduate Education in Science, 
Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology (NSF, 1996; NSTA, 1996). According to the NSTA 
article, the NSF report's primary recommendation is that, "college science and math programs 
should be refocused in order to better educate the 80 percent of the students who do not major in 
the science disciplines. All students should learn these subjects by direct experience with the 
method and processes of inquiry. Furthermore, any sustained national effort to improve science 
and math teaching eventually must address the quality of teacher education at the undergraduate 
level. Because few teachers, particularly those at the elementary level, experience any college 
science teaching that stresses the skills of inquiry and investigation, they simply never learn to use 
those methods in their teaching." The report also states that America's science, math, engineering, 
and technology faculty must actively engage their students preparing to be K-12 teachers (as well 
as others) by assisting them to "learn not only science facts, but also the methods and processes of 
research, what scientists and engineers do, how to make informed judgments about technical 
matters, and how to communicate and work in teams to solve complex problems." The NSF 
report further charges, that "while some institutions already are making the changes needed to help 
them meet that goal, most are not." (NSTA Reports, 1996, p. 11). 

The traditional differences in philosophy and approaches to teaching and learning between 
colleges of education and sciences has been repeatedly cited as one of the major obstacles in 
providing appropriate teacher-training programs. In an effort to alleviate this problem, Wright 
State University (WSU) has fostered a unique environment through a collaboration between the 




640 



■663 



College of Science and Math and the College Education and Human Services (CEHS) by creating 
dual appointments for faculty within these two colleges. These faculty have the primary 
responsibility for the design, implementation and evaluation of science teacher education programs. 
The faculty, through their individual strengths and expertise in science disciplines and teacher 
education and a shared commitment to and vision of science teacher education, have formed a 
highly complementary and effective team. 

In our planning to revitalize the teacher preparation program in science we followed the 
guiding principles set forth in Revitalizing Teacher Preparation in Science: An Agenda for Action. 
(Glass, Russell, and Anderson, 1993): 

• "Every elementary-middle-secondary science education preservice student should experience 
the investigative nature of science." (p. 8). This translates into 1) "direct investigative activities; 
2) at least one open-ended investigation carried out over an extended period of time; 3) given 
opportunities to collaborate with others — do as scientists do — and develop team work habits.” 
(p. 9). 

• "Every elementary-middle-secondary science education preservice student should have 
classroom and laboratory experiences that focus on relatively few, but powerful, topics in 
biology, chemistry, earth/space science, and physics.” (p. 9). 

• "All elementary-middle-secondary science education preservice students should understand the 
interrelatedness of science disciplines and the connections between science and other areas of 
knowledge." (p. 10). Our roles are then to assist students in understanding the connections 
among areas of science and to recognize that the efforts to learn how natural science, social 
science, mathematics, philosophy, and literature complement each other. 

• "All elementary-middle-secondary science education preservice students should learn scientific 
content and thinking process in the context of contemporary, relevant, personal and societal 
issues and problems." (p. 11). This would be accomplished by designing courses that have 
application to the real world and by integrating scientific-technical and social issues. 




641 



• "All elementary-middle-secondary science education preservice students must have a sound 
understanding of the nature of learning and how it can be applied to the learning of science." 

(p. 1 1). Once again, courses and student learning experiences needed to include content and 
activities that are carefully selected to be appropriate and sequentially ordered to be cumulative 
and build over time using an exemplary hands-on, minds-on science curriculum. 

• "All elementary-middle-secondary science education preservice students should have several 
intense and extended clinical teaching experiences at a variety of grade levels in diverse socio- 
economic and cultural settings." (p. 12). These experiences needed to be grounded in theory 
and pedagogical knowledge, and students must receive regular and systematic feedback from 
practicing master teachers, professors of science, and science educators. Courses and teaching 
must reflect appreciation for different learning styles, and modeling of higher-order 
questioning, use cooperative learning, and problem solving strategies. And another key 
element was good communication in that this type of endeavor requires intense and lively 
cooperation between faculties in education ant the arts and sciences. 

The Science Education Program 

The science teacher program incorporates the five major key elements of the NRC 
standards for science education (NRC, 1996), the NSTA standards for science preparation of 
elementary teachers (NSTA, 1992), and the Ohio Model (Ohio Department of Education, 1994). 
These are: Processes and Inquiry of Science (historical perspectives, the nature of science); 
Physical Sciences, Life and Earth Sciences, concepts and applications, articulated with broad 
themes and ideas, unifying concepts; STS perspectives, all taught within a constructivist learning 
environment, integrating pedagogy with conceptual understanding and content knowledge (See 
Figure 1). The program is founded on current content-specific science education research, science 
curricular guidelines as outlined by the national science standards, published curricular materials, 
and feedback from master teachers and partnership schools. The courses in the program are taught 
within a cooperative, constructivist, hands-on and minds-on environment. Furthermore, the 





642 



courses integrate science content with content-specific pedagogy and employ authentic assessment 
strategies.

The specific goals of the elementary education science program are: 

1) Students acquire an in-depth conceptual understanding of the fundamental science concepts in 
each content area through the inquiry process. This requires the successful application of these 
concepts in a wide variety of real-life situations which connect these concepts through unifying, 
interdisciplinary themes; 




643 666 



2) Students develop science process, problem-solving, and critical analysis skills utilized not only 
in the scientific process, but also in everyday life and decision-making; 

3) Students develop appropriate attitudes toward science and science teaching, including the 
understanding of science as an ongoing process of questioning, designing experiments, 
implementing these experiments, and evaluating the results as opposed to a set of facts or 
procedures to be memorized; 

4) Students become effective life-long learners and collaborative workers capable of independent 
and cooperative problem-solving, as well as, self-directed and motivated analysis, decision- 
making, and action; 

5) Students will be able to effectively implement constructivist teaching methodologies and utilize 
content-specific pedagogical knowledge to enable their future students to achieve scientific literacy. 

All the courses were specifically designed emphasize science concepts and applications, 
constructivist pedagogy, pedagogical content knowledge, and science as a process. As such, the 
courses have a concise scope, in keeping with the philosophy of “less is more,” are articulated 
with themes and “big ideas,” include STS perspectives, and address student misconceptions. The 
courses are subsequently taught in a classroom setting of approximately 25 students who 
cooperatively work in small groups on hands-on inquiry activities. 

The Foundation Course. 

As shown in Figure 2, the introductory course is Foundations for Science Literacy and 
Problem-Solving, which provides the beginning student with a philosophical and experiential 
understanding of a constructivist, cooperative classroom environment. This understanding is 
acquired through introductory hands-on inquiry experiences within the context of fundamental, 
unifying, interdisciplinary science themes and core concepts such as systems and interactions, 
change and constancy, properties of matter. These experiences emphasize science as a process, 
problem-solving and critical analysis skills. Students are required to analyze their class 
experiences relative to their previous science experiences, the impending science courses of the

program, and their future science teaching practices. The goals of the course are to prepare the 
students for the subsequent science and education courses in the program by: 

1) developing skills and thought processes necessary to become a complex thinker; 

2) orienting students toward constructivist learning environment; 

3) developing understanding of core science concepts such as mass, heat, temperature, etc. 
through unifying themes of properties and interactions of matter and systems, forms of energy, 
and change; 

4) developing communication skills and the facility to utilize multiple representations; 

5) familiarizing students with the national and state science standards; 

6) developing appropriate student attitudes toward science and learning in general; 

7) developing cooperative skills to become an effective collaborative worker; 

8) developing skills and habits of mind that will enable the students to become effective life-long 
learners capable of independent, self-directed analysis, decision-making, and action. 

This course is additionally the writing intensive course (as part of the WSU Writing Across 
the Curriculum initiative) for the science program. This affords the students the opportunity to 
express their views and attitudes toward science teaching and learning methods, as well as, to 
develop necessary critical writing skills. This course affords the science educators the opportunity 
to begin tracking the students in areas of attitudes toward science process, science learning, science 
teaching, as well as. their own science literacy. Each of these components is assessed throughout 
the program, beginning in this course. 

Physics and Chemistry 

Following the Foundations course, as illustrated in Figure 2, the students next take their 
physics and chemistry courses. Since these subjects are typically the subjects that students have 
had the least experience in, developing positive student attitudes is imperative. The integration of 
mathematics with these courses, although many times a source of trepidation for the students, 
allows the students to develop a further understanding of applications of mathematical skills within 
the context of a science investigation. These courses utilize the learning cycle in a constructivist 





646 



way by providing a concrete science situation illustrating the science concepts first, then analyzing 
the “how do we know?, why do we believe. . component of inquiry, and finally investigating an 
application of the concepts in other situations. The students go through many learning cycles 
starting with concrete examples before they are expected to manipulate abstract ideas. This method 
affords opportunities to address student misconceptions and to allow the students to acquire a 
depth of conceptual understanding in such areas as motion, forces, and energy transfers. 

These courses emphasize development of science process skills and problem-solving skills, 
as well as, conceptual depth. For instance, in the physics course, students utilize multiple 
representations of physical situations to aid in the abstract analysis of the concepts within these 
situations, and to aid with applications of the concepts in many different situations. The science, 
technology and society component of the course is incorporated through the many real-life 
applications of the science concepts that the students experience. 

The students also have course projects in which they design, implement and assess 
elementary/middle level science activities. In their activity design, they not only emphasize correct 
science process and conceptual aspects, but also the constructivist and cooperative methods utilized 
in implementing the activity. The students facilitate their own activities for the class and the class, 
as a whole, helps in the assessment. 

Biology and Geology 

As illustrated in Figure 2, following the physical science courses, students enroll in their 
biology and geology courses. The Concepts in Biology course was specifically designed to better 
prepare teachers to teach life science in today’s elementary and middle school environments based 
on the national science standards and the state science teaching model (see Fig. 1). Two science 
educators with backgrounds in biology and biology teaching worked to develop a course which 
addressed the content needed to teach elementary science as well as middle school life science and 
to demonstrate appropriate teaching materials and methods. 

. First, we literally turned the course around from the traditional presentation of material — 
chemistry of the cell to the (usually rushed or omitted) ending point of ecology/ environmental 




647 



science. Discussions with previous students led us to believe that they felt more comfortable and 
familiar with the concepts presented in the ’’bigger picture” areas of biology — ecology and 
environmental science. This also made intuitive sense in terms of teaching because we would be 
starting with material that was part of the everyday lives of students, even if they had not fully 

made the necessary connections. It was our job to help them develop those connections and to 

~ -\ 

understand the underlying concepts in these, and other areas of biology, using an activities-based 
focus on broad themes (cycles, patterns and change, systems and interactions, etc.) incorporating 
science process skills. We then proceeded to weave in needed content such as: ecological 
concepts, diversity of living organisms, genetics, taxonomic classification and the characteristics of 
plant and animal life, animal body systems, cell biology, and finally coming full circle to study 
some environmental issues relating in a very interdisciplinary fashion to all of the life sciences. 

This ending point also provides a logical lead into the final capstone course. 

One goal of this course was to foster more positive student attitudes toward life science and 
to capitalize on both positive and negative experiences in helping students to see how teachers can 
influence students’ interest in science. Initial data was collected using a questionnaire and survey 
regarding students’ attitudes toward science based on positive and negative science experiences. 
Learning about students’ attitudes toward science and prior experiences with science were 
important starting points in developing positive, “let’s find out” approaches to teaching life science. 
One trend revealed in the data was that several of the students had had some degree of success in 
the traditional lecture and occasional demonstration format. Throughout the course, these students 
voiced a degree of discomfort and dissatisfaction with the opened-ended, hands-on format of the 
course. Students who had less success in traditional courses and initially had less positive attitudes 
toward science overall expressed near relief that biology could taught in a more interesting fashion. 
Based on the findings of this study, the biology course herein described continues to evolve and 
change to better accommodate students’ understanding of biological concepts and more effective 
approaches to teaching science courses. 





648 



Concepts in Geology was developed to meet the Ohio Competency-Based Science Model, 
and the National Research Council's content standards for Earth Science. Course topics begin 
with minerals, then progress to Igneous, Metamorphic, and Sedimentary rocks. The history of the 
Earth, geologic time, fossils, the interior of the Earth, and plate tectonics follow. The Interior of 
the Earth is studied using earthquakes and seismic reflection and refraction principles (introduced 
first in Physics). The theory of plate tectonics, the Earth-Moon system and Meteorology round out 
this course offering. This course is content based (the only Earth Science the future teachers will 
receive in their training) and so the topics may be thought of as traditional. But the treatment of the 
topics is not. Each broad topic noted above is accompanied by hands-on activities designed to 
enrich the student's understanding of the topic under consideration. Real-time data available on the 
Intemet/world-wide web is used to bring the nature of scientific inquiry alive for the future 
teachers. 

Students come to geology having heard of the theory of plate tectonics, but are unclear as 
to the details of the paradigm. Virtually none understand how, for instance, scientists determine the 
boundaries or the nature of tectonic plates. The following is an example of how this course uses 
intemet/world-wide web technology to bring scientific inquiry to the course in the context of plate 
tectonics. Students attending the university receive e-mail accounts and through their personal 
passwords, are able to access the intemet/world-wide web. During the first week of the quarter 
students are given two world wide web site addresses. One is for the National Earthquake 
Information Center (http://www.neic.cr.usgs.gov), and Volcano World 

(http://volcano.und.nodak.edu). They are also provided with a physiographic chart of the oceans 
complete with longitude and latitude. They then plot the occurrence of earthquakes and volcanic 
activity over the course of a ten week quarter, using different symbols to plot deep and shallow 
quakes. When the topic of plate tectonics is encountered late in the quarter the students have 
substantially delineated the boundaries of some tectonic plates. They begin to understand the 
reasoning that scientists use to determine plate boundaries. Since deeper earthquakes are common 
at converging plate boundaries and shallow earthquakes dominate diverging boundary settings 




6 « 072 



such as the Mid-Ocean Ridge, they internalize the concept of a thinner oceanic crust. The 
differences between volcanism at converging boundaries and intraplate volcanism (Hawaii) become 
topics for class discussion rather than professor's lecture. Geography and map skills are also 
enhanced. 

The Capstone Course 

Projects in Science, as the capstone course, is designed to be a culminating experience in 
which the students apply the science content and processes acquired through the previous classes 
in the design, implementation, evaluation, and communication of an investigation of their 
choosing. The projects are interdisciplinary in that the concepts and processes involved cut across 
discipline lines. For instance, students could choose to investigate the effects of pollution (air, 
water, or sound), including technological and societal impacts. The students would perform direct 
experimentation and data collection, utilize library and computer information resources, analyze 
and present their results. This course permits students to gain natural multidisciplinary, 
technological, and societal perspectives of how a science investigation is genuinely conducted. 

The students also are expected to explore the potential applications of how similar science 
experiences could be used in their future classrooms. The goals of the course are: 

1) to further develop student understanding of the scientific process; 

2) to develop students abilities to design, implement, evaluate, and communicate scientific 
investigations; 

3) to develop student understanding of the relationships between science, technology, and society; 

4) to further develop student understanding of the concepts learned in previous science courses in 
the program within an interdisciplinary, thematic, investigative environment; 

5) to further develop and apply problem-solving, critical analysis, and decision-making skills and 
abilities within an interdisciplinary, thematic, investigative environment. 

Further Science Education Preparation 

When students have completed this sequence of specially designed science courses (see 
Fig. 2), they begin their professional sequence of education courses and experiences. The 





650 



Elementary School Science: Methods, Curriculum, and Materials course is designed to provide the 
developing elementary teacher with the central concepts, tools of inquiry, and structures of 
elementary school science enabling them to create learning experiences that make science 
meaningful for their future students. In this course, the preservice teachers acquire an 
understanding of how to utilize a variety of instructional strategies to encourage their students’ 
development of conceptual knowledge, critical thinking, problem solving, and performance skills. 
Moreover, they learn how to plan for instruction based on knowledge of the national and state 
science standards, the nature of science, the nature of how students learn and develop, and how to 
accommodate differing approaches to learning such that the developing teacher can create 
instructional opportunities that are equitable and adaptable to diverse learners. The overarching 
goal of the course is to provide the prospective elementary teacher with a broad set of viable 
approaches to effectively teaching science. These approaches are couched within the framework of 
the nature of science and the nature of the learner. More specifically, this course is designed to 
actualize the following objectives: 

1) the ability to plan and implement a constructivist, inquiry-based science program which 
challenges student to accept and share responsibility for their own learning; 

2) the ability to select developmental^ appropriate science content, adapt and design curricular 
materials that recognize and respond to student diversity and encourages all students to participate 
in science inquiry and learning; 

3) the ability to design, manage, and manipulate the learning environment to create a situation for 
the student which is supportive of science exploration and inquiry; 

4) the ability to understand how to access resources and guide students as they use science 
equipment and everyday materials, media and technological tools in such a way as they facilitate 
the acquisition of both declarative and procedural knowledge within the context of a safe and 
productive classroom environment; 




651 



5) the ability to engage and motivate students to pursue science inquiry and to facilitate the 
development of a community of learners that reflect attitudes and social values that are conducive to 
science inquiry; 

6) the ability to design and implement instructional frameworks that provide opportunities for 
active explorations into the connections and interactions between science, technology, and other 
human endeavors such as mathematics, history, the arts, and humanities, and to explore those 
connections and interactions as they relate to personal and/or global issues. 

The teacher preparation program at WSU incorporates a wide variety of field-based 
experiences prior to student teaching. Another teacher preparation option for individuals with 
undergraduate degrees who wish to enter the teaching profession is the Professional Year Program 
(PYP) which is part of the Goodlad network. The PYP is designed for individuals possessing an 
undergraduate degree to enter an intensive year-long program of clinical experiences and closely 
related course work, and after completion of the program to have teaching certification as well as a 
master’s degree. An interdisciplinary science teaching master’s degree is in development to 
individually tailor the science teaching and content needs of inservice teachers. Another aspect of 
the program that is in the development stage is to systematically pair preservice with “best 
practices” inservice K-12 teachers. This pairing aspect of the teacher preparation program will 
enable us to better sustain teacher professional development on both levels by more fully involving 
exemplary science teachers in preparing the next wave of classroom teachers. 

Concluding Remarks 

Being on a 10 week quarter system has serious draw backs, particularly when addressing 
the science content needs of elementary preservice teachers. This aside, the science educators are 
presently more concerned with and continue to work on the middle level component of the program 
as that area of certification is designed within the CEHS. 

Regardless of the cognitive understanding students have of the science education standards 
and the need for process skills approach to science teaching to reach all students, departure from 
the lecture- memorization- regurgitation- teacher-centered- passive student model of science 



courses were not initially well-received by a number of students who have succeeded in that 
traditional mode. Recent data indicate that students are now, two years into the new program, 
more receptive and are actually welcoming the changes in the science courses. Perhaps we are 
doing a better job of explaining the importance to this type of science teaching, or perhaps the 
students early field experiences permit them to have a better conceptual understanding of children’s 
science learning, or it may be a combination of these and other factors. The program as we have 
described it is, as it should be, an evolving program, dynamic in nature. We are learning along the 
way and more than willing to revisit original ideas and to change, design and redesign to best serve 
the preservice teachers and the inservice teachers involved in our program. Also, as a large 
proportion of local teachers are retiring within the next five years we feel that with this cohesive 
science education K-8 teacher preparation program in place our graduates can make a significant 
impact on effective science teaching in the Miami Valley area.

Exploring the Use of Visual Learning Logs 
in an Elementary Science Methods Class

Visual Learning Logs 

Visual data such as photographs, drawings, and schematics play a vital role in the 
scientific enterprise. In the everyday world icons, symbols, and signs are pervasive and 
powerful forms of visual communication. As children learn to read and write they do so 
with the aid of pictures and photographs. In science teaching, learners interact with 
nontextual pictorial elements of instructional materials and are also often asked to sketch 
or draw their work. 

The literature research on visual literacy is related to curriculum and instruction 
(Braden, 1987), to visual-verbal symbiosis (Braden, 1993 ), to teaching visual literacy at 
the elementary, high school and college levels (Case-Grant, 1973; Beauchamp, 1991); to 
foreign language instruction (Morain, 1976); to international communication of ideas 
without words (Sondak & Sondak, 1991); and to interpretation of environmental signs 
(Horsley, 1988). Little was found on the role of visual literacy as a component of science 
literacy or of science teacher preparation. 

The importance of creating visual representations is supported by Paivio's (1990) 
dual coding theory. Specifically, Paivio (1990) proposes that there are separate visual and 
verbal stores in memory. From this perspective, learning could be considered to be more 
effective when both verbal and visual memory traces have been created. The use of 
visual learning logs as we have done in this preliminary study also incorporates the 
advantages of techniques like concept mapping, in conjunction with reflective journal 
entries. 



In this study we present work in progress that investigates the use of visual 
learning logs by preservice elementary teachers as one component of developing visual 
literacy for science teaching and learning. Visual learning logs (VLL) consist of free- 
form drawings (i.e., pictograms) produced by the preservice elementary teachers in the 
study in conjunction with weekly written journal assignments. The intent of VLL was not 




655 



to illustrate the written journals, but rather to serve as an alternative to textual 
descriptions, explanations, interpretations and reflections on the course learning 
experiences. 



Purpose 

The purpose of the study is to explore the use of visual learning logs (VLL) as an 
alternative mode for thinking and communicating about experiences in an elementary 
science methods course that emphasizes developmentally appropriate, constructivist 
teaching. The ultimate aim of VLL is to improve science instruction for young children, 
including prereaders, early readers and normative English speakers. Specific questions 
investigated are 

1 . What kinds of information can be conveyed using VLL? 

2. What kinds of ideas can be expressed better in VLL than in written journals? 

Methodology 

Subjects were 20 preservice teachers enrolled in an elementary science methods 
class at a university in Hawaii. Two were males. The class was culturally diverse, 
representing the four major ethnic groups in Hawaii: Caucasians, Japanese and Filipino 
Americans, and Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders, plus other ethnic groups. For this 
preliminary study, results are aggregated. 

Procedure 

The preservice elementary science teachers were instructed to submit a visual 
learning log in conjunction with a written journal entry each week throughout a semester. 
Their specific instructions were to "draw a pictogram (a visual learning log) showing 
what you learned and what it means to you. Include feedback on your feelings about your 
learning experience." They were told to regard their VLL as an alternative form of a 
journal. That is, their visual logs should convey their ideas visually and not be dependent 
on information in their written journals. 

The preservice teachers were free to develop their own nontextual representational 
forms to depict and interpret their learning experiences. For affective representations, the 
class discussed the possible use of visual affective symbols such as a smiling face or 
other facial expressions, or stylized affective ratings such as thumbs-up or thumbs-down 
symbols. To connect the learning activities with time and place in memory, students were 




656 



encouraged to visually link their classroom experience with something noteworthy about 
each day. 

Preliminary work reported in this session examines VLL collected over a sampled 
two-week period, plus end-of-semester written comments from the students on the 
usefulness of VLL. To determine the kinds of information preservice teachers considered 
important in their visual representations of the science methods class, a categorization 
system was devised by the authors to carry out content analyses of the VLL. The 
categories are listed under Data Analysis and Findings. 

Students were asked at the end of the semester to look back over both drawn VLL 
and written textual journals and respond to "What kinds of ideas can you better express 
using a pictogram, not a written journal?" Responses were analyzed using a modification 
of the coding system used for VLL content analysis, then summarized. 

Data Analysis and Findings 

Data analyses consisted of calculating frequencies for each of the content analysis 

categories which were treated as mutually exclusive. Results indicated that the majority 

of VLL images consisted of depictions of science activities carried out in class (22%), 

group learning activities (22%), affect (13%), and science education concepts (11%). 

Images in other categories with lower percentages included descriptions of events in the 

daily environment (10%), nature of science (8%), activities chosen by groups (5%), 

* 

general education concepts (5%), and science teaching resources (3%). Uncodeable 
responses were less than 1%. 

These coded VLL findings indicate that preservice teachers are experiencing and 
remembering science teaching in their methods class as active learning. Additionally, 
science is experienced as a social learning process and science content and process are 
connected to real world situations. These findings are consistent with course objectives. 

Examination of written comments at the end of the semester revealed that students 
felt that compared to written journals, VLL better express 

1 . An immediate way for the teacher to see at a glance what the learner has experienced 
and selected as important. Commented a student, "When I look at the picture it 
reminds me and I can clearly picture the activity done in class that day." 




657 S8 Q 



2. Affective and aesthetic dimensions of science teaching and learning. They 
particularly noted that young prereaders could provide affective feedback with such 
images as smiling or frowning faces. One preservice elementary teacher said, "Using 
a pictogram, you can express aesthetic, emotional responses to activities and lessons 
that cannot otherwise be expressed in writing. Another said, "You can also tell what 
lessons were great for students because of the ratings that are used on the drawings. " 

3. The steps or processes involved in a hands-on activity. Visual depiction makes the 
process appear more realistic than using words alone. As stated by a student, "I could 
express my ideas using a pictogram better by drawing out the activities done." 

4. Observations and details that are "hard to describe in words" including the use of 
realistic colors. As one student said, "You can show colors and results rather than just 
writing about them." Said another, "Pictograms show more detail on what something 
looks like." 

5. An alternative means of expression for visual, nonverbal learners. As one of the male 
students said, "I just think overall it helps students who have trouble expressing 
themselves with writing. I personally enjoyed the pictograms compared to our 
written journals." Others mentioned "Greater opportunity for individual expression" 
and "Greater variety." Another said, "This also helps children who have a different 
learning style through color/pictures rather than just words." 

6. Alternative methods for teaching and learning, including . 

- engaging nonreaders, prereaders and ESL students in science learning. 

- reviewing lessons and sequences of lessons 

- evaluating and monitoring student progress, and 

- teacher's self-evaluation of lesson effectiveness. 

Working Conclusions 

Within the context of the science methods class, elementary preservice teachers 
are often "science shy." They have limited prior experience in science courses, and most 
often these courses focus on traditional teacher-centered pedagogy including lectures, 
note-taking, and multiple-choice tests. Findings from this study suggest that VLL provide 
an alternative way to help preservice elementary teachers gain confidence in their science 




658 



teaching ability and to prepare them in use of unfamiliar constructivist pedagogies. 
Because VLL are not dependent on text, including the use of scientific or educational 
terminology, from the outset of the course methods students have a way of recording, 
reflecting, and conversing on what they learned, how it was learned, and how it was 
taught. VLL supported written learning logs and use of concept maps in the methods 
class. Findings thus far suggest that VLL 

1. Create alternative ways for preservice elementary science teachers to meaningfully 
depict their science methods class experiences and to portray their own emerging 
understandings of science teaching and learning. 

2. Support constructivist approaches to science teaching and draw upon multiple 
modalities for learning. 

3. Provide a means of combining minimal verbal oral and written expression with 
concrete visual representations of complex ideas. Suggested here is that learners can 
engage with complex ideas before and during the process of mastering associated 
verbal learning. 

4. Allow an outlet for succinct affective feedback. This is an area where young children 
often lack effective verbal skills. This suggests that visual learning logs may be a 
useful tool for young children as well as their teachers. 

5. Can be used to promote reflection, for summary or review, and for evaluation. 

These preliminary findings point to the need for further research on the 
effectiveness of VLL as heuristic devices both in elementary science methods classes and 
with prereaders, nonreaders and ESL students. Research is needed comparing the 
effectiveness of VLL and written learning logs in preservice elementary science methods 
classes. Research is also needed on the links between visual literacy and scientific literacy 
and on the learning effectiveness of dual coding using visual and verbal memory. 
Additional research is needed on preparing teachers for visual dimensions of science 
teaching and learning.

CONSTRUCTIVIST TEACHING PRACTICES: 

PERCEPTIONS OF TEACHERS AND STUDENTS 
Sandra J. Moussiaux, Wayne State University 
Dr. John T. Norman, Wayne State University 

Constructivis t Practices 

Years of research on change in schools have provided elements of practice that work 
and do not work. The process of change involves three phases (1) initiation: deciding on 
an agenda and beginning work; (2) implementation: putting the change process into 
action; and (3) institutionalization: change becoming embedded into the curriculum with 
continuous learning and improvement taking place (Stiegelbauer, 1994). 

Systemic reform aims to change teaching and learning practices (Cohen, 1995). 
Constructivist teaching practices in science and mathematics classrooms are intended to 
produce much more challenging instruction for students and thus, produce improved 
student learning. Structural changes have a high symbolic value. It communicates that 
schools are serious about change. However, research has shown that changes in 
structures are not directly related to changes in teaching and learning (Elmore, 1995). 

The key questions then are; ( 1 ) how to change instruction so that teachers teach 
differently and students learn more, (2) what elements of practice have to be in place for 
structure to work and (3) what evidence shows that changes in structure are actually 
related to changes in instruction and learning practices. 

Research shows that the relationship between structural change in schools and 
changes in teaching and learning are related to elements such as; knowledge and skills of 
teachers, professional values and commitments and empowerment (Cohen, 1995; 

Elmore, 1995). Many times teachers approach systemic reform with little background 
knowledge of the type of instruction that is necessary for change to occur. Most teachers 
learn to teach in a traditional manner. Reformers need to focus first on developing 
teachers’ knowledge and skills before they focus on changing structure. Teachers need 
the opportunity for staff development so they might leant to teach differently. In 




661 



addition, teachers need the opportunity to develop shared goals, expectations and beliefs 
about what good teaching is, how to carry out instruction and then create an 
organizational structure that coincides with those goals, expectations and beliefs 
(Elmore, 1995). A change has to be clear in its goals and procedures and have a role 
within an organization that will lend to long-term support (Stiegelbauer, 1994). 

Successful systemic reform depends on more than improved teacher knowledge and 
skills. It requires changes in values and beliefs of acceptable professional practices and 
students' achievement ability. Change has to be valued by the organization and by the 
members within the organization (Steigelbauer, 1994). The organization should develop 
a shared vision of what its change should look like. In addition, teachers must believe 
that students are capable of advanced work in science and mathematics. They must be 
committed to working with students in pursuit of improved learning. The early 
involvement of everyone in problem identification and the need for change helps develop 
commitment. This commitment increases as teachers master instructional practices and 
students' increase their capacity to leam. 

Research has also shown that empowerment has a significant impact on instructional 
practices and measured student achievement (Elmore, 1995). Empowerment means 
giving people within an organization responsibility and support to actualize that 
responsibility. When teachers share in decision making, they have a vested interest in 
structural change. Change has to have practical outcomes for both teachers and their 
students. 

These elements of practice: teachers' knowledge and skills of instructional practices 
and learning, professional values and commitments and empowerment are crucial to the 
progress of systemic reform. 

This study focused on the elements important to systemic reform. This study also 
examined constructivist classroom instructional practices as viewed by teachers and 
students. It was part of an evaluation effort after the second year of a systemic reform 




662 



685 



change process in a large urban school district. A constructivist vision statement was 
developed for science and mathematics teaching, learning and staff development. 
Constructivism leads to new beliefs about excellence in teaching and learning 
and about the roles of both teachers and students in the process. In constructivist 
classrooms, students are active rather then passive; teachers are facilitators of 
learning rather than transmitters of knowledge (Stein et al., 1994, p. 26). 

Extensive staff development seminars for science and mathematics teachers focused on 
the constructivist vision. The evaluation effort included teacher, student surveys, parent 
and unit head focus groups, observations of staff development sessions and case studies 
of selected schools. Teacher and student surveys served to probe perceptions of the 
frequency of use of various constructivist teaching and learning practices in keeping with 
the systemic reform goals. Findings from this study indicated both teachers and students 
were active participants in a changing school curriculum and (a) the curriculum covered 
the elements of constructivist teaching and learning, (b) the teachers implemented this 
curriculum on a regular basis, and (c) the students reported regular experiences with 
constructivist teaching and learning practices. 

Traditional Instruction 

In the 1970’s and 1980's research was a dominant source for ideas about how to 
teach. This resulted in direct instruction, where teachers directly instructed students on 
the content or skills to be learned and provided practice until the learning was 
internalized (Steffe & Gale, 1995; Riber, 1992). Direct instruction is effective when the 
goal of instruction is to have students reproduce factual knowledge. However, when we 
make a distinction between training (to direct learning by transmitting knowledge) and 
teaching (to facilitate learning through hands-on experiences) we see how direct 
instruction can be of limited value.

Constructivist Teaching 

Research shows that constructivist teaching has only been widely accepted in 
mathematics and science since the early 1 980’s (Steffe & Gale, 1995). Cognitive 
psychology has provided a basis for constructivist teaching. Piaget (1971) was one of the 
early contributors to this research. He suggested that new experiences are received 
through existing knowledge, a process of assimilation and accommodation. Learners 
construct knowledge as they attempt to bring meaning to their experiences. Glaserfield 
(1995) was another contributor of constructivist research. He explains that 
constructivism is a theory of rational knowing. Learners construct knowledge themselves 
on the basis of subjective experiences. 

Constructivist teaching emphasizes thinking, understanding, reasoning and applying 
knowledge while it does not neglect basic skills. It is based on the idea that learners 
construct their own knowledge, rather than reproduce someone else's knowledge. In their 
book. The Young Child as Scientist: A Constructivist Approach to Early Childhood 
Science Education. Chaille and Britain (1991) point out in a constructivist classroom the 
teacher is no longer the transmitter of knowledge but the facilitator of learning. The 
teacher as controller of students is a myth (Tobin & Dawson, 1992). The facilitator of 
learning needs to keep in mind that instruction will vary depending on the learners prior 
knowledge, current interest, and level of involvement (Chaille & Britain, 1991). A 
skillful teacher will understand that students have existing knowledge, which may be 
incomplete or wrong, but will guide perceptions and initiate understandings (Tobin & 
Dawson, 1992). 

Constructivist Teaching Practices 

Constructivist teaching is guided by five basic elements; (1 ) activating prior 
knowledge, (2) acquiring knowledge, (3) understanding knowledge, (4) using knowledge, 
and (5) reflecting on knowledge (Tolman & Hardy, 1995). Activating prior knowledge is 
very important since what is learned is always learned in relation to what one already 



knows. When teachers are familiar with a students' prior knowledge they can provide 
learning experiences to build on these existing understandings (StefFe & D'Ambrosio, 
1995). Prior knowledge can be activated in many ways for example, by asking students 
what they know, by brainstorming, by doing semantic mapping, by predicting outcomes 
or by performing some skill or process. As Simon (1995) points out in his article, 
"Elaborating Models of Mathematics Teaching", teacher's knowledge is constantly being 
constructed as he or she interacts with students. Gurney (1995) states that articulation of 
prior knowledge acquaints teachers with students' thinking, affording insights from which 
to plan instruction. 

Research has shown that students must acquire their own knowledge in a way that 
helps them determine the extent to which it fits their existing knowledge. Shchlenker, 
Yoshida and Pery (1995), describe a lesson, ("Muscle Building"), where students' build 
their own model of a muscle. In each step, students have to interpret new knowledge in 
the context of what they already know. 

Once students have been exposed to new knowledge, the process of understanding 
knowledge begins. Teachers can assist in this development by providing many 
experiences that motivate students to explore this new knowledge and have them 
communicate their interpretations of it. Research indicates that communicating 
knowledge is essential for understanding (Fensham & Gunstone, 1994). There are many 
ways in which knowledge can be shared for example, conferencing between teacher and 
student, small group activities in which students voice their interpretations, oral reports, 
projects, role playing and demonstrations. 

Students must activate prior knowledge in order to extend and refine this knowledge. 
The most effective activities for knowledge use are problem-solving activities (StefFe & 
Gale, 1995). This encourages students to continue to examine and build on their 
knowledge. When students work in groups to solve problems, it is more useful than 




when they work alone because they have the opportunity to constantly voice ideas and 
receive feedback (Chaille & Britain, 1991 ). 

Reflection refers to understanding what one knows. This requires providing 
activities that ask students to look back at what they have learned (Tobin & Dawson, 
1992). Journal writing is an especially good technique to promote reflecting. 

Purpose of the Study 

The purpose of this study was to examine and compare the frequency of use of 
selected constructivist classroom instructional practices as perceived by teachers and 
students and to provide information about the process of systemic reform. Surveys were 
designed to assess the extent to which an Urban Systemic Initiative has been 
implemented within the schools. Significance for this study rests in four arguments: (a) 
establishment of baseline data on implementation of the elements of constructivist 
teaching practices (1996), (b) establishment of baseline data on students reporting 
experiences with constructivist practices (1996), (c) measuring changes in baseline data 
(a & b above) that will impact a large population (1997), and (d) extensive research. 

This study serves as a baseline for determining systemic reform change and future needs. 
Second, baseline data from this study will provide evidence of the implementation of 
regular constructivist teaching practices and learning experiences. Third, the findings of 
this research are likely to have implications for a large population and will be useful to 
science and mathematics educators. Finally, this study will attempt to examine 
constructivist instructional strategies used currently in science and mathematics 
classrooms. 

For this investigation, the researcher defined constructivist instructional strategies 
that support constructivist learning as active learning with hands-on experiences that 
emphasize process and constructing meaning from these experiences and from prior 
knowledge. Constructivist teachers facilitate learning by assisting students in 
constructing knowledge. Specific research questions examined included.

1 . How frequently do teachers report using constructivist practices in 
in their classrooms? 

2. How frequently do students report experiencing constructivist practices 
in their classrooms? 

3. How do the reports of teachers and students compare with regard to 
using constructivist teaching practices? 

4. Is there a difference in the school level (elementary, middle, high school) of the 
teachers with regard to the reports of using constructivist practices? 

5. Is there a difference in science and mathematics teachers with regard to the 
reports of using constructivist practices? 

6. Are there any differences in the responses of science and mathematics teachers 
reporting constructivist practices at various school levels (elementary/science, 
middle school/science, high school/science, elementary/mathematics, middle 
school/mathematics, high school/mathematics)? 

Method 

Sample 

The sampling units were existing fourth, eighth and tenth grade classrooms in a large 
urban school district. Fifty-four schools were randomly selected from a stratified sample, 
stratified by school level (elementary, middle and high school) and by tier (representing 
the degree of implementation of the systemic reform effort tier 1, 2 and 3). 

A two stage sampling process was used for teachers. The first stage was the random 
selection of schools by tier ( ten elementary, five middle and three high schools). The 
second stage consisted of asking all mathematics and science teachers within each school 
to complete the teacher survey (n = 570). 

In addition, a three stage sampling process was used for students. The first stage 
consisted of randomly selecting schools by tiers (ten elementary, five middle and three 
high schools). For the second stage, two homeroom classrooms from the fourth, eighth 





667 



and tenth grades were randomly selected from these schools. The third stage consisted of 
asking all of the students in each of these homerooms to complete the survey instrument 
(n= 1080). 

Response Rate 

Completed surveys were received from forty-nine of the fifty-four schools for a 91% 
school response rate. Completed surveys were received from two hundred eighty-nine 
teachers for a 51% response rate and eight hundred sixty-two students for a response rate 
of 80%. 

Design 

A teacher survey (33 items) and a student survey (39 items) were developed to 
determine the frequency of various instructional practices. The teachers marked their 
questionnaires by indicating how often they practiced these constructivist instructional 
practices by circling a response for each item (1 = almost never, 2, 3 = weekly, 4, and 5 
= almost daily). The students marked their questionnaires by circling a response to 
indicated how often they experienced constructivist practices for each item (1 = never, 2 
= sometimes and 3 = almost everyday). Teacher responses were collapsed into 
categories (#1 and #2 responses = 1 (never), #3 responses = 3 (weekly), #4 and #5 
responses = 5 (almost daily)). Parallel specific contructivist teaching survey items were 
selected from both teacher and student surveys and included the following areas: 

1 . The discussion of careers in mathematics and science technology. 

2. The use of manipulative materials and hands-on activities to discover principals 
and relationships in mathematics and science classrooms. 

3. The frequency of use of computers in mathematics and science instruction. 

4. The frequency of use of calculators in mathematics and science instruction. 

5. The frequency of discussing African-American and other minority groups 
(multicultural perspectives) in mathematics and science. 

6. The frequency of use of group activities in which students work cooperatively 




668 



in solving problems. 

7. The frequency of use of projects in mathematics and science classrooms. 

8. The frequency of writing in mathematics or science journals. 

9. The frequency of opportunities for students to make choices about what they 
study in mathematics and science classrooms. 

10. The frequency of maintaining portfolios of mathematics or science work to 
reflect growth over time and to document evidence of learning. 

1 1 . The frequency of personal conferences to reflect on progress and 

accomplishments in mathematics and science classrooms. 

12. The frequency of using models to represent concepts in mathematics and 

science. 

13. The frequency of opportunities to exercise mathematics or science skills. 

As a part of a previous study, teachers were asked to indicate their perceptions of the 
adequacy of curriculum in the areas of mathematics and science (teachers survey section 
B) in 1993 and again in 1996. Teachers indicated how adequate they felt the curriculum 
was by circling a response for each item (1 = not at all adequate, 2 = somewhat adequate, 
3 = adequate enough). The following items appeared on both surveys: 

1 . The development of problem solving skills. 

2. The development of relationships between mathematics, science, and other 
disciplines. 

3. The adequacy of how the curriculum relates to the needs of urban students. 

4. The preparation of students for a college education. 

5. The preparation of students for local and national science tests. 

6. The preparation of students for future jobs. 

7. The development of practical skills to use scientific instruments, calculators and 
computers. 




669 



8. The adequacy of how the curriculum relates to social issues relevant to the 
student. 

Teachers' opinions about the adequacy of the curriculum has changes over this three 
year period during the implementation of this systemic reform process. Overall, teachers 
reported significant improvements in the science and mathematics curriculum between 
the 1 993 and 1996 surveys. Significant improvements were noted in the adequacy of the 
curriculum in all areas, (p < .05) except for mathematics teachers in the area of 
preparation of students for local and national test and relating the curriculum to issues 
relevant to students. Table I provides a comparison of teacher views from 1993 to 1996.

Instrument 



The researcher used a teacher and student survey developed to determine the 
frequency of high quality curriculum covering elements of constructivist teaching 
practices. These instruments were found to be reliable using internal consistency 
techniques. The teachers instrument had an internal consistency reliability coefficient of 
.91 and the students instrument had an internal consistency reliability coefficient of .78. 

Data Collection and Analysis 

Using the teacher and student survey, average responses of constructivist items on 
the teacher survey were calculated and compared with similar items on the student 
survey. Next, similar comparisons were made by school level (elementaiy, middle and 
high school) and by subject area (mathematics and science). 

Results 

Data taken from the surveys were analyzed for each research question. 

Question 1 . How frequently do teachers report using constructivist practices in their 
teaching? 

In answering this question, data obtained from the teachers survey titled "Curriculum 
and Practice" (section IA) served as the primary source of information. From the data it 
was learned that the frequency of using constructivist practices at least weekly was 50% 
or greater in all areas with one exception, using computers in mathematics and science 
instruction (28%). It should be noted that technology resources are being phased in 
across the school district and at the time this data were collected, these resources were 
not currently available to all students. 

The majority of teachers (93%) report that they regularly (weekly or more often) use 
group activities in which students work cooperatively to solve problems. This data 
indicates that most teachers tend to provide a range of activities to promote active 
learning. Table II gives a breakdown of the percentages of instructional constructivist 
practices used by teachers weekly of more often.

Question 2: How frequently do students report experiencing constructivist practices in 
their classrooms? 

Classroom student surveys, asking how frequently they experience constructivist 
practices, "In Their Mathematics Classroom" (student survey sections I) and "In Their 
Science Classroom" (student survey section II) provided data for this question. Student 
survey responses were separated by subject (student survey section I mathematics and 
section II science). These data provided information on the amount of constructivist 
instructional practices that students experienced in their classrooms. These data revealed 




672 



the majority of the students do experience constructivist practices in their classrooms. 
The percent of students experiencing these constructivist practices at least weekly was 
greater than 50% for twenty of the twenty-six items. The only exceptions found were 
using computers in science class, (29%) using computers in mathematics, (42%) using 
calculators in science class, (39%) integrating multicultural aspects into science 
instruction, (48%) and integrating multicultural aspects into mathematics instruction 
(44%). Table III provides a distribution of constructivist learning experiences. Based on 
these findings it is clear that students are not passively absorbing information, but are 
actively involved in constructing meaning from many experiences.

Question 3: How do the reports of teachers and students compare with regard to 
using constructivist teaching practices? 

The researcher compared certain teacher responses, "Curriculum and Practice" 
(teacher survey IA items) and student responses, "In Your Mathematics Class"(student 
survey I items) and "In Your Science Class" (student survey II items) to determine the 
relationship between their perceptions of the frequency of constructivist practices in their 
classrooms. The researcher could not do analysis to correlate these responses since 
teachers could not be linked with their respective students. Instead the researcher 
compared average responses of teachers and students for each of the specified questions 
(see Table IV). 

Based on these data there are strong relationships between teacher and student 
reported perceptions of the frequency of using constructivist practices in their classrooms 
in the areas of group activities, (teachers = 93%, mathematics students = 85%, science 
students = 93%) and making choices, (teachers = 57%, mathematics students = 61%, 
science students = 52%). 

Minimal differences were noted in all other areas with the exceptions of computer 
use, (teachers = 28%, mathematics students = 42%) calculator use, (teachers = 63%, 
mathematics students = 90%, science students = 40%) projects, (teachers = 56%, science 
students = 71%) writing in journals, (teachers = 79%, mathematics students = 50%, 
science students = 55%) portfolios, (teachers = 54%, science students = 70%) 
conferences, (teachers = 54% mathematics students = 79% science students = 79%) using 
models, (teachers = 90%, mathematics students = 64%, science students = 78%) and 
doing exercises (teachers = 97%, science students = 73%).

Question 4: Is there a difference in the school level (elementary, middle, high school) of 
the teachers with regard to their reports of using constructivist practices? 

To address this question data were collected from teacher surveys and then separated 
by school level (elementary, middle school, high school). An examination of this data 
revealed the following distribution of the frequency of constructivist practices used by 



0 

ERIC 



676 



teachers at different school levels (see Table V). Elementary and middle school teachers 
report using constructivist practices in their classrooms most often (50% use it weekly or 
more often in all areas with the exception of computers 43%). The percentage of use of 
constructivist practices was highest for the elementary school level. Overall, high school 
teachers reported using constructivist practices least often, with only seven of the thirteen 
areas being greater than 50%. 

There was a notable decrease in reported constructivist teaching practices from 
elementary to high school with regard to the use of computers, (elementary 43% and high 
school 23%) multicultural aspects, (elementary 91% and high school 49%) projects, 
(elementary 63% and high school 48%) and portfolios (elementary 61% and high school 
46%).

Question 5: Is there a difference in the responses of constructivist teaching practices in 
subject area (science or mathematics) of the teachers with regard to the 
reports of using constructivist practices? 

Data for this question were examined by separating teacher certification (science, 
mathematics) and looking at their responses to survey items, "Curriculum and Practice" 
(teacher survey section IA). The tally on subject area and use of constructivist practices 
is shown in Table VI. In these classrooms the only differences found were with the use 
of calculators, (survey item IA-13), integrating multicultural perspectives (survey item 
LA-14), and the use of projects to observe students at work (survey item IA-19). Science 




678 





teachers integrate multicultural perspectives into their curriculum and use projects more 
often than mathematics teachers. Mathematics teachers use calculators with their 
instruction more often than science teachers. 

Question 6: Are there any differences in the responses of teachers reporting 

constructivist practices after combining grade level and subject area 
(elementary/science, middle school/science, high school/science, 
elementary/mathematics, middle school/mathematics, 
high school/science)? 

The data shows some significant differences with regard to constructivist practices 
after combining grade and subject area (see Table VI). In the elementary level noticeable 
differences in frequency of use of constructivist instructional practices were found for the 
use of calculators (elementary/mathematics 66%, elementary/science 53%). At the 
middle school level the following differences were noted in the frequency of use of 
constructivist practices; the use of calculators, (middle school/mathematics 76%, middle 
school/science 51%) integrating multicultural aspects, (middle school/mathematics 54%, 
middle school/science 63%) use of projects, (middle school/mathematics 45%, middle 
school/science 54%) writing, (middle school\mathematics 73%, middle school\science 
84%) and using portfolios (middle school/mathematics 56%, middle school/science 
48%). Differences were also noted at the high school level with the use of projects (high 
school/mathematics 32%, high school/science 62%) writing, (high school/mathematics 
76% high school/science 88%) and making choices (high school/mathematics 46% high 
school/science 56%).

Discussion 

Understanding the elements of practice which influence the success of systemic 
reform opens the door to improving teaching and learning practices. The findings of this 
study document the nature and extent of growth and future needs of a systemic reform 
process, resulting from extensive staff development seminars and intensive classroom 
constructive instructional practices. One form of systemic reform growth was evident in 
the teachers' opinions about how the adequacy of the curriculum has changed during the 
implementation of this process (see changes in teachers views from 1993 to 1996, Table 
I). It is our speculation that the reported improvements are associated with a number of 
components including; 1) adoption of a shared vision statement, 2) broad support 
involving the school and community in the systemic reform process 3) staff development 
workshops focusing on constructivist instructional techniques and where constructivist 





680 



teaching strategies were modeled by workshop instructors, 4) administrative support (unit 
heads, principals, area office and central office supervisors) and 5) continuous 
monitoring of the change effort. 

Another evidence of systemic reform process can be found in the use of 
constructivist practices by science and mathematics teachers. Teachers identified the 
frequency with which they implemented various elements of constructivist teaching 
practices (Table II). These data indicated that teachers implement constructivist 
practices regularly in their classrooms. The frequency of implementing constructivist 
practices weekly or more often was 50% or greater in most areas. The only exception 
was using computers (28%), although this was due to the fact that computers are just now 
being phased in across the school district. These constructivist elements consisted of 
providing hands-on experiences using manipulative materials, using computers in 
instruction, using calculators in instruction, integrating multicultural aspects into the 
curriculum, providing group activities for students to problem solve, using projects to 
assess student learning, offering opportunities for students to write and communicate 
their experiences, maintaining student portfolios, providing several one-on-one 
conferences to discuss student progress, using models to teach concepts and offering 
many opportunities for students to do exercises. 

The responses of teachers about their use of constructivist practices were validated 
by student responses (see Table III for student responses). Students generally agreed with 
teachers about the frequency of use of constructivist instructional practices (see Table 
IV). The most frequent instructional experience reported by students was working in 
groups (mathematics students 85%, science students 93%). This supports the research on 
the value of group learning (Steffe & Gale, 1995). These findings suggest that minimal 
differences in perceptions of teacher and student responses are present. 

The reported use of constructivist instructional practices was further examined by 
school level. Strong relationships in the perceptions of teachers and students were 



ERIC 



681 




present in the areas of group activities and making choices. In general both teachers and 
students agreed that constructivist teaching was taking place on a regular basis (see 
"Constructivist Practices as Reported by Teachers at Various School Levels", Table V). 
The percentages of use of constructivist practices was highest for elementary school 
level. High school level reported using constructivist practices least often. This 
difference in school level might be attributed to the heavier emphasis on subject matter 
content over process as one progresses from elementary school to high school. Higher 
grade level teachers might feel the pressure to teach more traditionally to cover the more 
extensive amount of content at that level. 

In addition, differences in the response of science and mathematics teachers were 
examined with regard to their reported use of constructivist instructional practices (see 
Table VI). These findings suggest that science teachers use constructivist practices more 
often than mathematics teachers. However, mathematics teachers use computers, 
calculators and conference with their students more often than science teachers. 

The reported changes and use of contructivist instructional practices will be 
monitored in successive years of the systemic change process. The preliminary evidence 
provided here indicate that teachers are using constructivist instructional practices and 
have changed their views about the adequacy of the curriculum during this systemic 
change process. 

Conclusion 

The findings of this study provide evidence that; 1) teachers feel the science and 
mathematics curriculum is much more adequate since the implementation of the systemic 
reform process, 2) teachers report using a variety of constructivist strategies in their 
classrooms (weekly or more often) and 3) students also report experiencing constructivist 
practices in their classrooms. Overall, teachers and students report using several 
constructivist practices in their classrooms. 



The necessary elements of systemic reform and constructivist practices appear to be 
present in this school district. Teachers and students report using activities that support 
activating prior knowledge. In addition, teachers appear to be aware of the most current 
research, that students must acquire their own knowledge as a part of the constructivist 
theory. The majority of teachers report using models (90% weekly of more often) and 
hands-on experiences (90% weekly or more often). Dialog between teacher and student 
through conferencing is essential for a student to understand knowledge. Teachers and 
students reported conferencing 54% weekly or more often, having group activities (93%) 
and using projects (56%). Students use their new knowledge through problem solving 
(93% weekly or more often) and reflect on knowledge through writing (78%). 

A curriculum built upon constructivist beliefs is concerned with the aspects of 
learning in which students make sense of experiences in terms of existing knowledge. 
Research has shown that much can be gained by the infusion of constructivism into 
instructional design. It can provide environments in which learning is achieved through 
discovery and inquiry. It offers promise in the development of successful learning 
experiences by producing students who think, apply knowledge and solve problems. 

Future Research 

Inferences can be drawn from these findings, if teaching, learning and staff 
development are planned with a shared vision, then it is possible to make changes in 
classroom instruction to improve the learning environment. Research associated with 
improving student outcomes indicates that constructivist practices are educationally 
advantages for all students. However, additional research is needed to continue assisting 
science and mathematics teachers, and indeed all teachers, to demonstrate competency in 
constructivist teaching practices. A constructivist approach to in-service teachers may 
require us to elicit prior knowledge held by teachers about teaching and learning. 
Additional follow-up studies will help us determine what is necessary to provide teachers 
with the skills and motivation needed to enable them to continue experiencing growth in 



developing the knowledge base characteristic of experienced and competent

promote more change with upper grade level teachers, which elements of the systemic 
change process were most critical for effecting changes in teachers views about the 
adequacy of the curriculum and indeed about the change in instructional practices.

FIFTH GRADE STUDENTS' PERCEPTIONS ABOUT SCIENTISTS 
AND HOW THEY STUDY AND USE SCIENCE

Introduction 

Studies assessing students' images of scientists (Krause 1977; Chambers 1983; Schibeci & 
Sorenson 1983; Fort & Varney 1989; Huber & Burton 1995; Finson, Beaver & Cramond 1995) 
have shown that students possess interesting stereotypic images of scientists. For example, 
students generally perceive scientists as being white males and view scientists as individuals who 
work alone in a laboratory. Chambers (1983) and Schibeci and Sorenson (1983) found that as 
young children progress through successively higher grade levels, their images of scientists 
become more and more stereotypic until they reach fifth grade. At this time, their stereotypic image 
of a scientist appears to be fully developed. 

The most common technique used to assess students' images of scientists has been the Draw-A- 
Scientist Checklist (DAST-C), developed by Chambers (1983). In using DAST, investigators ask 
students to reveal their image of a scientist through a drawing. To provide a reliable and efficient 
format for analyzing students' drawings, Finson, Beaver, and Cramond (1995) developed the 
Draw-A-Scientist Checklist (DAST-C). Each item on the DAST-C represents a stereotypic 
characteristic derived from reviews of literature relating to students' images of scientists. During 
the analysis of a student's drawing, the more items "checked" on the DAST-C, the more 
stereotypes appear on the student's drawing. Although the DAST and the DAST-C are useful; 
tools in gaining insight into students' concepts of scientists, Finson, Beaver, and Cramond (1995) 
identify two cautions in the use of these instruments: 

Maoldomhnaigh and Hunt (1989) reported that students may posses more than one definition 
of the word scientist, and this may results in students drawing different images at different 




688 



711 



times without having their perceptions changed by a particular treatment. Additionally, 
Maoldomhnaigh and Mhaolain(1990) found that changing the wording in directions given to 
students can alter the types of drawings produced. Such results underscore the importance of 
having a standardized procedure, including standardized instructions, to follow when 
administering the DAST. In addition, although the DAST-C appears to yield results similar 
to those obtained through structured interviews (indicating it accurately assesses the students 
perceptions of scientists), it may fail to elicit all the richness of data possible through 
interviews, (p.204) 



The Portrayal of Scientists in the K-12 Curricula 

Since the early 1970's, concerted efforts have taken place to present inclusive images of 
scientists and to show how they engage in the scientific enterprise. For example, in K-12 science 
programs, women and ethic minority groups are depicted as having active roles in science. In 
features like "Ask a Scientist" in Addison-Wesley Science, scientists are portrayed as "regular 
people" who dress in everyday clothes and are able to communicate about their scientific activities 
to children (Barman, et.al. 1992). Science related careers are highlighted in Destinations in 
Science (Brummett, et.al. 1995), Discover the Wonder (Heil, et.al. 1993), and 
MacMillan/ McGraw-Hill Science (Atwater, et.al. 1993) to show students that "doing science" 
occurs in a variety of occupations. In addition, some science programs have incorporated features 
that show students how science occurs in their everyday lives. For example the "Back Home" 
feature from Destinations in Science (Brummett, et.al. 1995) invites students to use their home or 
neighborhood to study science and the "Technology and Society" feature in the 
MacMillan! McGr aw Hill Science (Atwater, et.al. 1993) shows students how science knowledge 
and the applications of science relate to the everyday life of themselves and their family members. 

The way students studied science has also been an area of concern for science educators and 
curriculum developers. The main issue has been to find ways for students to be "doing" science 
rather than just reading about it (Kahle 1992). Therefore, most recent K-12 science materials have 




689 



712 



included a variety of activities that encouraged students to engage in the same processes that 
scientists use. In these activities, students describe objects and events, ask questions, construct 
explanations of natural phenomena, test those explanations, and communicated their ideas to 
others. 



Procedures 

Because of the concerted efforts since the 1970's to provide students with a realistic image of 
scientists and how they go about "doing science," we are interested in addressing three specific 
questions related to the way students view science. Specifically, we will focus on the following 
questions: (a) What are the current images that students have of scientists? (b) How do students 
perceive they study science in school? and (c) Do students perceive they are using science outside 
of school? To address these questions, we devised a protocol that incorporated the current 
methods of DAST, some techniques to take into account the cautions suggested by Finson, 
Beaver, and Cramond (1995) which relate to using a standardized procedure and structured 
interview questions, and procedures that we felt would further enhance our ability to understand 
the students' perceptions of scientists and science. 

An initial concern that we had about DAST was related to asking students to make a "forced 
choice." If you ask students to draw a scientist, does this force them to make a choice between a 
male or female? Or, if you asked students to draw two scientists, would this provide them with the 
freedom to depict both sexes? To answer this question, we randomly selected two groups of ten 
fifth grade students. Each group had an equal number of boys and girls. Group A was asked to 
draw two scientists doing science while Group B was asked to draw one scientist doing science. 
In Group A, 7 students drew two male scientists, 2 students drew a male and female scientist, and 
1 student drew 2 female scientists. In Group B, 7 students drew a male scientist and 3 students 
drew a female scientist. Because the drawing of two scientists took each students twice as long to 
complete as the drawing of one scientist and because there appeared to be no major differences in 




690 



the results of groups A and B, we decided to develop our protocol with students drawing only one 
scientist. 

We also wanted to provide students with an opportunity to draw scientists from different racial 
backgrounds. Therefore, we provided each student with a set of colored pencils or crayons before 
they were asked to draw a scientist. 

Each student was given the following directions and asked questions individually. Even though 
each student was asked a set of standard questions, each interview session was informal enough to 
allow the investigator to gain additional information about the students' drawings and to clarify any 
of their responses. The responses were audio-taped and later transcribed for further analysis. The 
set of directions and questions used in each interview session are: 

1. Will you please draw a picture of a scientist doing science? When you are finished, 

will you please explain your drawing? 

2. On another piece of paper, will you please draw a picture of yourself doing science in 

school? When you are finished, will you please explain your drawing? 

3. Can you think of some ways you use what you leam in science outside of school? 

Sample 

One hundred seventeen fifth grade students (57 males and 60 females) from the midwestem 
and southwestern parts of the United States were chosen for this study. Eighty-seven of these 
students came from one private school and two public schools in a large midwestem city. The 
remaining 30 students came from a private school in a large southwestern city. The students 
enrolled in the private school in the midwest were primarily from middle to upper income 
families while the students from the private school in the southwest were mostly from middle 
income families. The two public school from the midwest contained students primarily from 
low to middle income families. In terms of ethnic background, 73 students were Caucasian, 40 
students were Afro-American, and 4 students were of Asian descent. 



Analysis 

The students' drawings of scientists were analyzed using the DAST-C. Each drawing was 
rated for specific stereotypic images and additional information obtained from the student 
interviews was compiled and reviewed (table 1).

The drawings of students doing science were grouped into two main categories: (1) those 
who pictured themselves as passive learners such as reading about science or taking notes at a 
desk and (2) those who saw themselves as active learners (table 2). Additional information 
obtained from interviews was also compiled and analyzed.

Data related to students' perceptions about using science outside of school were gathered 
from the interview transcripts. These data were categorized into four main groups: (a) students 
who think they can use science but are unsure how, (b) students who only see themselves using 
science by repeating activities from school, (c) students who could generalize the use of science 
knowledge and processes to everyday situations, and (d) students who did not see any use of 
science outside of school (table 3).

Results 

Perceptions of Scientists 

As shown in table 1, the students in this study had similar images of scientists to those 
revealed in previous studies (Chambers 1983; Fort & Varney 1989; Finson, Beaver, & 
Cramond 1995; Huber & Burton 1995). Generally, the students perceived scientists as being 
white males who do their work in some type of laboratory. 

A few other items worth noting about the students' drawings of scientists are related to the 
scientists' clothing and their facial expressions. Scientists wearing regular clothing such as 
bluejeans and t-shirts are depicted by 20% of the students while 26% pictured the scientist in a 
lab coat. In regard to showing any facial expressions on the scientists, most of the students 
depicted scientists with no expression. However, 23% of the students did draw scientists with 
smiles on their faces. When asked to explain this aspect of the drawing, the students generally 
indicated that the scientists enjoyed doing their work. 

Perceptions of School Science 

When students were asked to draw a picture of themselves doing science in school, 56% 
drew themselves at desks either reading a science book or taking notes. When asked about their 




694 



717 



drawings, several of the students said that they usually sit at a desk and read their science book. 
However, these students also indicated that they would prefer to do some type of activity during 
science. Doing some type of science activity was depicted by 27% of the students while 17% 
drew themselves outdoors looking for insects, leaves, rocks, or plants. 

Perceptions About Using Science Outside of School 

The majority of the students (60%) viewed the use of science outside of school as an 
extension of their school experiences. Students cited specific school activities that they did at 
home such as mixing vinegar with baking soda. Several students stated that they were able to 
help one of their younger siblings with their science homework because they had been given 
similar assignments. It was felt by 26% of the students that they never use science outside of 
school and 5% thought they probably use their science knowledge and skills outside of school, 
but they were unsure as to how they use the knowledge or skills. 

A total of 9% of the students were able to connect the skills and knowledge they gained from 
science to everyday activities. For example, these students cited how they use problem solving, 
making observations and inferences, identifying small animals and plants, predicting weather, 
and caring for plants and pets in their everyday lives. 

Discussion 

Although steps have been taken by curriculum developers and science educators in the last 
few decades to highlight women and minorities in science, most of the students in our sample 
perceive scientists as white males who practice science in some type of laboratory. This points 
to a continued need to search for ways to show K-12 students that scientists are represented by 
both genders and are from a variety of ethnic backgrounds. In addition, scientists should be 
portrayed as everyday people. Therefore, teachers need to be encouraged to use the special 
features in science textbooks that highlight science careers, depict scientists as everyday people 
who are capable of sharing their work with non-scientists. Resources, like Dragonfly (Project 
Dragonfly 1996), could also help teachers present students with an inclusive image of science 



and scientists. Dragonfly is a publication in which students interview scientists and publish the 
procedures and results of studies they have conducted. In addition, this magazine highlights the 
work and daily lives of scientists. 

The most recent K-12 science curriculum programs include activities to engage students in 
"doing science." However, a large number of students in our sample perceive their school 
science experience as either a reading exercise or a time to listen to someone lecture about 
science. The National Science Education Standards (National Research Council 1996) has 
explicit recommendations about teaching science as a process of inquiry. Teachers need 
professional development which provides dialogue and concrete examples designed to help 
them put these recommendations into classroom practice. 

Videotapes featuring scientific expeditions and investigations would present scientists in a 
dynamic mode. Inviting women and minorities to talk with the class about how they leant about 
and use science would offer opportunities for students to broaden their ideas about scientists on 
a more personal level. Building on these experiences, pointing out the scientific contributions 
by females and minorities would continue to broaden student perspectives. The historical 
sequence in the development of our understandings about the way things work would help 
students gain an appreciation for the personalities of scientists as "real people." 

Our findings in this study indicate that most students do not see a connection between what 
they learn in science and how it can be applied to their everyday lives. Students need to be 
presented with concrete examples that demonstrate the connection between school science and 
what they do outside of school. For example, teachers could engage students in activities that 
show them how specific skills like observing, measuring, and classifying are used in everyday 
activities (Mercier & Ostlund 1996). Students could be encouraged to make collections of 
things such as rocks, leaves, insects, etc. in order to discover patterns and to develop 
classification skills. 

Engaging students in product testing is an effective strategy for learning how to use the skills 
of science. As students conduct a "fair test" for various products they will learn how to control 





696 



variables in an investigation. This may help make science more relevant for students. 
Additionally, involving teams of students in long term investigations will help them get a feel 
for the work that scientists do. These projects simulate what scientists do, e.g., working 
together to formulate a question, making observations, gathering data, drawing conclusions, 
sharing and challenging conclusions drawn from data, and finally trying to reach a consensus. 
Additionally, making connections with math and communications creates a realistic view of 
doing science. 

Science classes could also incorporate live communication with scientists. For example, 
Internet connections can involve classes around the world in conducting research and sharing 
data on phenomena such as the pH of rain. The Jason Project is another way students can 
engage in doing science with active scientists. 

Final Note 

The next step is to plan and implement a pilot program using some of the ideas presented 
above. Since assessment often drives the curriculum, if students' ideas about scientists and 
how they use science everyday is evaluated, teachers will be more likely to employ strategies to 
increase realistic perceptions. The information that we obtained in this study has been limited to 
a few schools in the midwest and southwest. We encourage others to use the protocol 
discussed in this paper to gain insights about how students in different parts of the United States 
perceive science and its relevancy to them. We also believe that the protocol discussed in this 
paper should be used on a continual basis by teachers to collect information about how their 
students' views regarding science change over time. These data would provide valuable 
feedback to teachers regarding whether students are developing a realistic perception about 
science and its usefulness to them. This information could serve as an evaluation tool for 
teachers to assess the effectiveness of their science instruction.

A UNIVERSITY GRANT PROJECT ON SCIENCE EDUCATION FOR 
STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES: TEACHING ELEMENTARY 
SCIENCE IN INCLUSIVE CLASSROOMS 

Katherine I. Norman, California State University San Marcos 

Students with disabilities are now being integrated into general education classrooms. 
Elementary teachers are expected to teach these students all academic areas, even though they have 
received limited training in working with students who have disabilities. Many elementary teachers 
have not had professional development experiences in either science content or science methods. 

The science learning needs of many students with disabilities are not being met in regular 
classrooms, as evidenced by the failing or borderline passing grades. Yet science has been 
identified as one of the most valuable subjects that can be taught to students with disabilities. 
Advantages of science include the concrete, hands-on learning activities; less focus on language 
skills such as reading and writing; high level of group interaction and participation; and the 
promotion of interest and inquisitiveness. 

There is a need to focus on the training of teachers to adequately prepare them cognitively 
and affectively to accept and instruct students with special needs. An additional need is to involve 
more elementary teachers in science so that they are able to engage all students in science 
experiences. This program is designed to fill the need for instruction for preservice elementary 
teachers in science education and special education. 

Description 

Teaching Elementary Science in Inclusive Classrooms is a science education program at 
The University of Texas at Brownsville designed to prepare elementary teachers to teach science to 
students with disabilities in inclusive classrooms. It is funded by the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration (NASA), the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston. Program 
participants are preservice teachers enrolled in two undergraduate courses: Teaching Children with 
Disabilities in Inclusive Settings and Teaching Science to Special Populations.

Teaching Children with Disabilities in Inclusive Settings presents information on inclusive 
education for students with disabilities. Characteristics of various handicapping conditions are 
examined as well as appropriate instructional modifications related to science. The participants are 
taught adaptations to use in teaching students with disabilities so that they may obtain and use 
scientific information. An emphasis is placed on the contributions to the field of science made by 
individuals with disabilities and particularly those from minority backgrounds. Participants gain an 
appreciation of the untapped abilities of future South Texas scientists. 

Teaching Science to Special Populations includes information on teaching inquiry science in 
classrooms of diversity. Topics include adaptations and modifications of science curricula, 
activities to engage all learning modalities and multiple intelligences, cooperative groups in lab 
investigations, planning for safety in the science laboratory, and strategies and techniques for 
disruptive behaviors. Participating teachers take part in hands-on science activities designed for 
students with disabilities, and assist elementary students in the design of science projects. The 
course includes a field experience component during which students work with cooperating 
teachers to teach science to students with disabilities in inclusive classrooms. 

During the two courses, participants develop science instructional modules for use in public 
schools. The modules include science activities for elementary school students with learning, 
visual, hearing, orthopedic, mental and emotional disabilities. In addition, participants implement 
interventions using modifications in science lessons for students with disabilities, and they 
document their efforts in case studies. The case studies and science modules are presented and 
discussed during a panel presentation at the University at the conclusion of the year-long program. 

Objectives 

The objectives of this project focus on helping preservice teachers develop a knowledge 
base about individuals with disabilities and about best practices in meeting the needs of students 
with disabilities in the science classroom. The four project objectives are listed below. 



1 . To familiarize prospective teachers in elementary general education to the characteristics of 
students with disabilities. 

2. To enable prospective teachers in elementary general education to develop adaptations and 
modifications of investigations in science to facilitate the inclusion process of students with 
disabilities. 

3 . To develop science modules for use in public schools, on teaching elementary school science to 
students with disabilities in inclusive classrooms. 

4. To create a mechanism to disseminate the model for this program and its products. 

Special Education Categories 

For those not familiar with special education, the categories of disabilities and terminology 
associated with these disabilities can seem overwhelming. The various categories of disabilities and 
impairments are summarized in this section. 

Learning Disabilities 

A learning disability refers to a disorder in one or more of the basic psychological 
processes involved in understanding or in using language (spoken or written) which may manifest 
itself in an imperfect ability to listen, think, speak, read, write, or do mathematical calculations. 

The term includes perceptual handicaps, brain injury, minimal brain dysfunction, dyslexia, and 
developmental aphasia. The term does not include children who have learning problems which are 
primarily the result of visual, hearing or motor handicaps or mental retardation, or emotional 
disturbance, or of environmental, cultural or economic disadvantage. 

Speech or Language Impairments 

Speech disorder 

A speech disorder is an impairment of voice, articulation of speech sounds, and/or 
fluency. These impairments are observed in the transmission and use of the oral symbol system. 

A voice disorder is defined as the absence or abnormal production of vocal quality, pitch, 




702 



loudness, resonance, and/or duration. An articulation disorder is defined as the abnormal flow of 
verbal expression, characterized by impaired rate and rhythm which my be accompanied by 
struggle behavior. 

Language disorder 

A language disorder is the impairment or deviant development of comprehension and/or 
use of a spoken, written, and/or other symbol system. The disorder may involve (1) the form of 
language (phonologic, morphologic, and syntactic systems), (2) the content of language (semantic 
system) in any combination. 

Mental Retardation 

Mental retardation refers to substantial limitations in present functioning. It is characterized 
by significantly below average intellectual functioning, existing concurrently with related 
limitations in two or more of the following applicable adaptive skill areas: communication, self- 
care, home living, social skills, community use, self-direction, health and safety, functional 
academics, leisure, and work. Mental retardation manifests before age 18. 

Serious Emotional Disturbances 

This term refers to a condition with one or more of the following characteristics displayed 
over a long time and to a marked degree that adversely affects a student’s educational performance: 

• An inability to learn that cannot be explained by intellectual, sensory, or other health factors 

• An inability to build or maintain satisfactory interpersonal relationships with peers and teachers 

• Inappropriate types of behavior or feelings under normal circumstances 

• A general pervasive mood of unhappiness or depression 

• A tendency to develop physical symptoms or fears associated with personal or school problems 
The term includes children who are schizophrenic but not children who are socially maladjusted, 
unless they are seriously emotionally disturbed. 




703 




Multiple Disabilities 



Multiple disabilities means concomitant impairments (such as mental retardation-blindness, 
mental retardation-orthopedic impairment), the combination of which causes such severe 
educational problems that they cannot be accommodated in special education programs solely for 
one of the impairments. The term does not include deaf-blindness. 

Hearing Impairments 

This disability refers to an impairment in hearing, permanent or fluctuating, that adversely 
affects a child’s educational performance but which is not included under the definition of 
deafness. 

Orthopedic Disabilities 

Orthopedic disability means a severe orthopedic impairment that adversely affects a child’s 
educational performance. The term includes impairments caused by congenital anomaly (clubfoot, 
absence of some member), impairments caused by disease (poliomyelitis, bone tuberculosis) and 
impairments from other causes (cerebral palsy, amputations, and fractures or bums that cause 
contractures). 

Other Health Impairments 

Other health impairments refers to having limited strength, vitality, or alertness due to 
chronic or acute health problems such as a heart condition, tuberculosis, rheumatic fever, nephritis, 
asthma, sickle cell anemia, hemophilia, seizure disorder, lead poisoning, leukemia, or diabetes that 
adversely affect a child’s educational performance. 

Visual Impairments 

Students with visual impairments represent a wide range of visual abilities. Consistent 
with IDEA, educators classify students with visual impairments by their ability to use their vision 
or their tendency or need to use tactile means for learning: 





704 



• Low vision describes individuals who can generally read print, although they may depend on 
optical aids, such as magnifying lenses, or other means to enlarge the size of the print A few 
read both Braille and print Individuals with low vision may or may not be legally blind but are 
able to use their visual sense for learning. 

• Functionally blind describes individuals who typically use Braille for efficient reading and 
writing. They may rely on their ability to use functional vision for other tasks, such as moving 
through the environment or sorting clothes by color before washing them. Thus, they use their 
limited vision to supplement the combination of tactual and auditory learning methods. 

• Totally blind describes those individuals who do not receive meaningful input through the 
visual sense. These individuals use tactual and auditory means to learn about their 
environment. 

Deaf-Blindness 

Individuals with deaf-blindness may have diverse combinations of vision and hearing 
impairments with normal or gifted intelligence, or they may have additional mental, physical, and 
behavioral disabilities. Because these individuals do not receive clear and consistent information 
from either sensory modality, a tendency exists to turn inward to obtain the desired level of 
stimulation. The individual may appear passive, nonresponsive, and/or noncompliant Students 
with dual sensory impairments may not respond to or initiate appropriate interactions with others 
and often exhibit behavior that is considered socially inappropriate. 

s 

Traumatic Brain Injury 

Traumatic brain injury refers to an acquired injury to the brain caused by an external 
physical force, resulting in total or partial functional disability or psychosocial impairment, or both, 
that adversely affects a child’s educational performance. This term applies to open or closed head 
injuries resulting in impairments in one or more areas, such as cognition; language; memory; 
attention; reasoning; abstract thinking judgment; problem-solving; sensory, perceptual, and motor 
abilities; psychosocial behavior; physical functions; information processing; and speech. The term 







705 



does not apply to brain injuries that are congenital or degenerative, or brain injuries induced by 
birth trauma. 

Autism 

Autism describes a developmental disability significantly affecting verbal and nonverbal 
communication and social interaction, generally evident before age 3, that adversely affects 
educational performance. Other characteristics often associated with autism are engagement in 
repetitive activities and stereotyped movements, resistance to environmental change or changes in 
daily routines, and unusual responses to sensory experiences. The term does not apply if a child’s 
educational performance is adversely affected primarily because the child has a serious emotional 
disturbance 



General Guidelines for Working with Students Who Have D isabilities 
There are numerous special education texts which elaborate on each of the disabilities, and 
make recommendations on how to teach students with each of these disabilities. However, the 
inclusive classroom may include many students with different disabilties, as well as students of 
various achievement levels who are not labeled “special education.” The general education teacher 
needs to know how to teach a class of students that is composed of students on these various 
ability levels and that have many distinct needs. Ten useful suggestions are presented below. 

1 . Empower the student to be an active participant in all classroom and school activities. 

2 . Do things with, instead of for, the student when he or she needs assistance. 

3. Include the student in conversations. Never talk about the student in front of her or him. 

4. Consider the age-appropriate expectations of classmates. Treat the student as you would her or 
his classmates. 

5 . Develop ways for classmates and teachers to include the student Be a model on how to do 
this. 

6. Be a part of the class. Work with all students. 



7 . Know, follow, and enforce classroom rules. 

8 . Watch classmate and teacher reactions to a potentially disruptive student Respond accordingly 
and problem-solve on the spot 

9. Point out successes and positive changes for all to celebrate. 

10. Be friendly but firm. Maintain consistency in your expectations and in your responses. 

1 1 . Adapt and modify materials and procedures to the special needs of each students. Try to 
incorporate into your lessons activities that engage all learning modalities —visual, auditory, 
tactile, and kinesthetic. 

12. Break complex learning into simpler components, moving from the most concrete to the 
abstract. 

13. Have students copy assignments for the week into a folder kept in their notebooks. 

1 4. Plan active learning activities that help the students connect what is being learned with their real 
world. 



Components of Effective Inclusion Programs 
Our experiences suggest that there are four necessary components to successful inclusion 
programs in teacher education: 

• Collaboration between general educators and special educators. 

• General adaptations for working with students who have disabilities. 

• Specific adaptations, as identified on the Individualized Education Plan (IEP). 

• Empathy, beginning with an awareness of who the students are, as well as their strengths and 
limitations.

KNOWLEDGE AND INCIDENCE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AMONG 
ELEMENTARY SCIENCE METHODS STUDENTS 



Claudia T. Melear, The University of Tennesse 



Introduction 

Science does not exist in a vacuum. Indeed, as proponents of the Science, Technology, 
Society focus for science education have said for many years, science education is embedded in the 
fabric of society. No one in the science education community would argue that science education 
should no longer be presented as a discreet set of memorizable facts and concepts. Most would 
now agree that the best science education utilizes both the prior experiences and cultural contexts of 
the learners. Equally as important is that science educators view their preservice teachers in exactly 
these same constructivists contexts: the lived experiences of those elementary science methods 
students influence their understanding of what is taught more than any other single factor. 

Feminist researchers have reported for years that female students feel alienated in most 
science courses. Efforts begun two decades ago that sought to increase the number of women who 
become scientists have not brought the desired changes. A partial solution may be to teach from 
the experiences and needs of the female student population. Clearly, the statistics that follow on 
domestic violence as well as the results of this survey show that large proportions of women and 
girls encounter domestic violence at some time in their lives, including those women who become 
teachers. Domestic violence is, above all, a health issue for women. The results of this study 
portend that twice as many women who are enrolled in elementary preservice science methods 
courses than the national average have experienced domestic violence. This result is alarming and 
demands that further research into the matter be conducted; curriculum may need to be developed 
that addresses the health aspects for all women in teacher education courses as well as for their 
future K - 12 students. The National Association for Children of Alcoholics (NACOA, 1986; 




708 



Allen, 1989) has developed such materials to address the needs of elementary education teachers 
and their students; NACOA’s model can be used as a guide for curriculum development for 
teachers and children who experience violence in the home. 

Multicultural science education has yet to confront curriculum development areas; that is, 
the topics selected as worthy of study—the content of courses—has yet to be colored by the 
multicultural lens. Melear (1995), however, has presented a multicultural framework for topics in 
biology that includes domestic violence, children of alcoholics, alcohol education, substance 
abuse, AIDS education, nutrition, prenatal care, disease prevention, contamination of water and 
environmentally associated diseases. Melear argued that some of these were topics of more 
importance to women and minority groups for the reason that women and minorities were more 
often the victims when, for example, domestic violence or alcohol abuse occurs. 

It may come as a shock to science education readers of this paper that anyone would 
propose such a topic as domestic violence for inclusion in the teacher education curriculum. So 
great has been the stigma and invisibility of domestic violence and its victims that such a topic has 
never been raised in the experience of this science educator nor in the experience of those surveyed 
for this study. However, in view of constructivists’ theoretical framework that undergirds science 
education research, the topic seems relevant. Also, in the view of James Rutherford, the director 
of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) reform effort in science 
education, societal problems such as violence are factors in the practice of educators. Rutherford 
(1992) writes that “For many children, daily life is confusing, unstable, even dangerous. . . . 
Schools need to see that children escape those conditions for at least part of the day,” (p. 5). 
Rutherford quotes chapter 14 in Science for All Americans, which explains that reform in 
education can improve America only if today’s worst social problems are ameliorated. He does not 
say that educators should reform society. Yet he says that “curricula of the future must wrestle 
with the question of what balance to strike between school and community” (p. 5). Also, 
Rutherford says that we stand a better chance of improving America as educators make headway in 




709 



732 



“instilling in its graduates a commitment to health (personal, family, community, and 
environmental)” (p. 5). 

Therefore, the topic of domestic violence is within the purview of scientific study for the 
impact it may have on science teaching and learning. The issue may be as important for teachers as 
for the children they teach. Allen (1989) reports that another group with history of abuse, children 
of alcoholics, are drawn to professions in which there is a care component, such as nursing and 
teaching. This phenomenon emanates from the dynamics of dysfunctional families in which some 
family members take over the responsibilities of the addicted or abusing partner. Children in these 
types of families adopt behaviors that they observe. We in the teaching profession may find an 
extraordinarily high representation of children of domestic abuse among our teacher education 
candidates just as Allen (1989) reported regarding children of alcoholics among the teaching 
profession. Indeed, this small study of two classes of candidates for teaching portends just that. 

Another salient link of the topic of domestic violence to science education is that domestic 
violence is a factor in the health of women (Rosenberg & Fenley, 1991). Not only do women and 
girls constitute 50% of the K - 16 population, but more than 75% of all teachers are women. Also, 
women comprise up to 95% of elementary teachers. Therefore, the topic then is a gender issue 
because it has differential implications for women than men, especially in teacher education. The 
teachers in this study were all elementary education majors; they were surveyed in their science 
methods courses, required of all elementary education majors. 

Both male and female children, however, are affected by domestic violence. A new report. 
Hidden Casualties , cited in NSTA Reports. 1996) finds that violence, both indirect and direct, has 
a considerable effect on learning ability and may limit cognitive ability and disturb physiological 
functioning. It is important for teachers to be able to detect when a child comes to school after 
witnessing an incident of violence. The constructivist framework demands that teachers 
understand the background and prior experiences of the learner. 

Tobin (1994) acknowledges that “The histories that these students bring to their chemistry 
class are an integral part of the learning environment that has not often been the focus of 




710 733 



researchers in science education” (p. 3). He suggests that in the chemistry class that he is 
observing that students have a problem with chemical addiction and their lives are touched by 
adults with substance abuse problems. He asks, “Why can’t the curriculum extend to 
investigations of the problems that afflict the lives of these students?” (p. 3) And, he states that “It 
is clearly possible to develop courses that are rigorous and that intersect with the lives and interests 
of students,” (p. 3). It is not that teachers are to be the designated social worker to intervene in a 
situation. Tobin’s population is described in respect to sociocultural factors, such as low family 
income, low level of employment of parents, high incidence of students from single-parent homes, 
and a high proportion of students from homes where English is not a native language. Domestic 
violence is not localized to just these sociocultural factors, however. 

The point is that if the statistics on domestic violence are to be believed and if the results of 
this study portend the size of the “iceberg,” this is a problem that affects many women and 
children. A societal problem that affects a large number of children needs to be acknowledged and 
addressed by the professional education community. Because domestic violence is an issue of 
women’s health (also children’s well being), it is an issue for science educators to study. 

Domestic violence is a topic worthy of research and curriculum development because elementary 
teachers in most schools teach all subjects. There are no health educators in most elementary 
schools; even if there were, science and health go hand-in-hand in importance in the lives of 
children. All of the preceding argument is for inclusion of domestic violence as a topic of 
sociocultural importance in science education. 

When we examine the traditional science curriculum, we see topics that have been chosen 
by the members of the science community; historically that has been members of one group, white 
men. Matthews (1992) in fact reports a masculine bias in science. We do not have to decide how 
that bias is displayed; it is enough to note that if men, in general, select topics of study, frequently 
they have not chosen topics of interest to women. For example, in science research, we have the 
well-documented and unarguable examples of males as exclusive subjects in heart-attack studies. 
Even though more women die from heart disease than from any other ailment, women were not 





711 



included in heart disease studies until the last decade. Selection of topics to study for science 
research has its complement in selection of science topics to present in a science class or for science 
education research. This paper suggests that through a multicultural lens, topics of importance for 
science curriculum development and science education research includes both domestic violence 
and substance abuse. The study that follows is the first attempt to bring the issue of domestic 
violence into focus in science education parlance. 



Domestic Violence Literature Review 

More than 3 out of every 100— or 1.8 million— women reported that they had been severely 
assaulted by male partners or cohabitants (i.e., they were punched, kicked, choked, beaten, 
threatened with a knife or gun, or had a knife or a gun used on them) during the preceding 12 
months (Straus & Gelles, 1990, cited in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, 1996). 
Stark and Flitcraft (1991) report that 20% of adult women in the United States— perhaps as many as 
15 million women— have been physically abused at least once by a male intimate. Clinical data 
from health care settings indicate that abuse may be the single most important source of injury 
among women (more than three times as many injuries as that received in auto accidents); that 
abuse is rarely an isolated episode; and that abuse is largely neglected by health researchers, 
including those specializing in injury. The CDC (1996) reports that one-half of all injuries 
presented by women in health care facilities were the result of a partner’s aggression. 

Abuse data may in fact be grossly underestimated because the presence of physical abuse is 
reported four times more often when women are asked about it directly in interviews than when 
they respond to questionnaires (O’Leary, Vivian, & Malone, 1992, in CDC, 1996). Stark and 
Flitcraft (1991) point out that personal interviews with victims of domestic violence are rarely 
done. 

Stark and Flitcraft (1991) define domestic violence as the category of acts under which 
spouse abuse and woman battering are normally defined. An operational definition of violence or 



O 

ERIC 



712 



735 



spouse abuse must rely on an inclusive notion of violence by an adult regardless of the severity of 
injury inflicted or whether it involves injury, psychosocial problems, or simply fear. The central 
concern is future health risks; and the important differentiation is between an anonymous assault, • 
mugging, or other street crime where further assault by the criminal is unlikely and assault by any 
social partner regardless of sex, age, marital status, or cohabitation. Clinically, in health settings, 
the definition of spouse abuse would include any act of force (including threats) for which social 
partners seek help. 

Spouse abuse indicates concern for males as well as females and for situations in which 
both partners are equally abusive. Equally important is violence among gays, lesbians or 
adolescent heterosexual dating partners. While survey and other data exist to demonstrate the 
frequency of woman abuse, there are no survey data indicating that men view husband abuse as a 
serious problem. 

Battering is a syndrome (Stark, 1979, cited in Stark & Flitcraft , 1991) that describes a 
range of problems following initial episodes of abuse. The battering syndrome includes a history 
of injury and often includes sexual assault, general medical complaints, psychological problems, 
and persistent help seeking. Women who are separated, divorced, or single are at the highest risk 
of battering. No process comparable to battering has been observed among abused men. This 
suggests that woman abuse (which leads to battering) is clinically distinct from mutual abuse, 
husband abuse, and the range of other tactics couples use to resolve conflicts. Woman abuse is a 
problem with an extremely low spontaneous-cure rate. Stark, Flitcraft, and Frazier (cited in Stark 
& Flitcraft, 1991) report that 85% of the women in their medical case load who have ever been 
abused remain at risk. Battering may be presented to health care providers through chronic and 
frustrated help seeking; nonspecific complaints of pain, injury during pregnancy, fear or anxiety 
associated with family conflict; isolation; and multiple psychosocial problems related to the stress 
of living in a violent home, including substance abuse, rape, child abuse, attempted suicide, and 
mental illness. The disproportionate risk of these problems among battered women appears 
primarily after the onset of abuse, which suggests that battering is the cause. 



O 



713 



The model favored by Stark and Flitcraft (1991) to explain why battering occurs is the 
feminist gender-politics model, though they describe the interpersonal violence and the family 
violence models as well. The gender-politics model contends that violence in the family is merely a 
special instance of a pattern of male control that extends from dating relationships through 
parenting and marriage to economic life. Violence is an option some men choose when they feel 
their privileged access to scarce resources (like money or sex) is threatened by female 
independence or when women fail to fulfill perceived domestic responsibilities. Women do not 
stay in abusive relationships because of psychopathology on their part Women stay in abusive 
relationships more because of fear, lack of emotional and economic support, interventions that 
blame them as victims, and because the absence of resources combine to make mere survival more 
practical than escape. Support for the gender-politics theory is compelling (Stark & Flitcraft, 

1991). Clinical data implicate male violence and control as the source of abuse to women. Single, 
divorced, and separated women are actually at a greater risk of abuse than married women; and 
women are injured as frequently by dating violence as by marital violence. 



Method 

Students in two elementary science methods classes CN. = 40) in a large regional 
southeastern United States university in the fall of 1995 were the subjects. The mostly all women 
(there were 4 men) were asked near the end of a class meeting to voluntarily and anonymously 
answer three questions regarding domestic violence. 1 . What personal knowledge do you have of 
domestic violence? (If you are not sure if what you know is really abuse, please list it; and I can 
decide). 2. What knowledge, other than personal, do you have of domestic violence? 3. What 
can elementary teachers do regarding this issue? No discussion of domestic violence had occurred 
in the class that day; indeed, the topic had never arisen. All students in both classes willingly 
participated, some taking great pains to stay after class to complete rather lengthy answers.

The following are sample remarks of students (S) from question 1: 

SI : I know someone who is extremely cruel to his wife and children. He has been violent 

towards both. He destroy(s) articles in the how (se). He takes away privileges from his 
oldest son fo(r) no reason. He even threw away the child’s comic books. Whatever brings 
anyone else pleasure he takes away. The children are withdrawn and fearful. Beneath the 
surface there is a burning hatred in the son. He has expressed a desire to kill his father. 

S2: I know of a woman whose husband ass(a)ulted her, then claimed she hurt him. She was 

the one with bruises not him. This same man, who I had been married to, verbally abused 
me. He had me feeling I couldn’t accomplish anything. He had to know where I went and 
how long I’d be gone, but he could do anything he wanted. He abused our children also. 
Physically he whipped excessively. Verbally they weren’t any good no matter what they 
did. 

S3: I worked with a woman last summer who was abused by her husband many times. She 

came to work with broken fingers, bruises, and other signs of abuse. My boss reported 
her husband for abuse, but I’m not really sure what was ever done to help her. 




715 



S4 Personal knowledge is that I was abused, threatened and very scared of an x-boyfriend. 

He would threaten to kill me if I did not do things. It got to the point where I was scared 
for my life to do anything, and the thing I wanted to do most is get away from him. At this 
point in my life I weight 125 pounds and was very attractive (very thin) and my nickname 
for 2 years was Chubby. Its funny now b/c he weighed about 230 pound and was 5’ 10” 
(FAT). I never thought that I would get in that type of situation b/c I have always been a 
very strong person. In this point of my life, I lost myself, my families support . . 
everthing that was and is important to me. I got out of this relationship 2 years ago and 
about 1 1/2 yrs ago he came to my apt. here in Greenville, broke in & trashed it . . .so 
everyday basically I am still somewhat frightened by him in fear that I may see him, or he 
may call. It is not fun, but I have my mom back as my best friend & I have a lot of suport 
from the rest of my family & all of my great friends!! [The student drew a smiley face.] 

S5: I have a female friend that almost died as a result of her husband ? s beatings. Also I have 

been told by many women that their husbands hit or slap them when he is angry or has 
been drinking. The manner in which they speak of this, suggest that they do not consider 
this domestic violence, but an occassional lapse in good judgement on his part 
S6: I have seen one of my goodfriends abused by her boyfriend. When they fuss, he would 

hit, kick, or push her. They finally broke up. My 2 little cousins were also thrown across 
the room by their stepfather. He said he threw them on the bed but they had severe bruises 
(age 15 mo. & 3 yr.). 

S7: I have never been abused but I have worked at (the) Women’s Shelter. The sites that I 

have seen will horify you. I have seen women & children so physically abused it was hard 
to tell exactly what they looked like. 

S8: I just know my grandmother was made to do extra work around the house. She cooked, 

cleaned, took care of the many children, etc., even with everyone at home. This is a little 
of both physical and mental. She also received severe discipline.

The following are sample responses to question 2: 

I know that domestic violence is usually about control issues. I also know that it happens 
often. The O. J. trial really brought out the whole domestic violence issue. I feel that it is 
something that needs to be addressed. (This response was from a student who has no 
domestic violence in her family but who knows someone who has been abused . 1 
Domestic violence is any type of abuse be it verbal, physical, or mental from a spouse, 
parent, child, boyfriend, girlfriend, or friend. It is anything that can hinder your train of 
thought in such a way that it makes you scared or frightened of another human being. It is 
anything harmful (physically) that can hurt you by another person. fThis was f rom one of 
the students who anonymously identified herself as having been personally abused . 1 
I hear about it on the news all the time. It’s definitely not rare. It’s not regulated to just 
physical abuse. 

Domestic violence has become a very “hot” item on TV talk shows. It always amazes me 
how some women believe this to be love! 

There are many forms of domestic violence but I do not know every one. I do feel strongly 
on knowing most of them. Such as: striking someone with the fist or any object, always 
blaming others for your actions, pushing others (for no reason) using force. Some people 
think only bruises & scars are proof of violence but any [thing] physical such as hitting or 
verbal abuse is considered a form of domestic violence. 

O. J. I know it is a big problem in today’s society. Men think they can beat their 
girlfriends and wives and get away with it. O. J. did! 

I’ve noticed recently with the O. J. Simpson case that women are not given much support 
or help from law enforcers. There are not a whole lot of laws that protect women from this 
abuse. 

Just the common knowledge--it occurs more than you would think--it is a terrible problem 
in our society.

S9: I can say I know what channels to turn to if a situation like this occurs[s] because of my 

education about this issue. This response mav be the best we could hope for. 

Table 6 displays the list generated by the preservice elementary teachers regarding what 
elementary teachers can do about domestic violence. Twenty-four (40.0%) said elementary 
teachers could teach about it. Seventeen (17) said elementary teachers can report it Eight (13.3%) 
said they could show support (to students presumably). Ten (16.7%) said they could notice signs 
(10) and one (1.7%) said to administer a questionnaire.

The following are sample remarks regarding question 3: 

SI: Teachers can keep their eyes open & be aware of signs of abuse. I don’t think that teachers 

should try to deal with this alone. I think if they suspect abuse, they should call on the 
guidance counselor or psychologist to help evaluate the suspected victim. They must also 
be careful not to wrongly accuse parents of abuse. It is really a touchy issue. 

S2: Elementary teachers can teach their students what real love consists of in the world. And 

be a friend so that students can be able to communicate their fears and anxieties to them. 
This area will fit well into “Character Education,” that is not being taught in the school 



systems. 



S3: Elementary teachers can teach about domestic violence in the classrooms. It can be 

explained simply as “this is wrong.” If someone sees this happen, they need to let an adult 
know. Teachers should also watch students & see if they look abused. 

S4: School teachers should be able to notice some problems w/children. All a teacher can do is 

support the child. If there is enough proof, I think they have to report it. The main thing to 
do is encourage the child, and let them know there is help. 

S5: Look for signs from students that something may be going on at home and refer the 

children you suspect may be experiencing this to the counselor. 

S6: Elementary school teachers should teach a limited amount of information concerning this 

issue. It all depends on what grade level and if they are ready for something of this nature. 

I believe the teacher needs to make sure that she will be able to discuss this with her class 
before actually doing it [italics added]. 

S7: I think the most important thing a teacher can do is make the child aware of what domestic 

violence is. It could be going on right in the very home, but if it is something that goes on 
all the time, the kids don’t realize the harm. Teachers should report any scenes of any kind 
of abuse or violence to the proper authority ! 

S8: They can talk about domestic violence and let the children know that it is abuse, but that if it 

is happening it is not their fault. Let them know where they can go to receive help. 

S9: Teachers should intervene to prevent or stop domestic violence. If it exists in a student’s 

home life, the teacher should report it. 

S 10: Elementary teachers can enlight[en] children to at least be able to recognize and address 

such abuse, i.e.: Where do you go for help. 

The following are sample remarks regarding teaching about domestic violence: 

SI : Just giving a basic introduction to the issue. Also make the environment feel relax & easy 

so if the children want to confide in someone. 

S2: We can teach students to recognize what it is.

S3: Bring the subject up in general during health class or have (a) book that may discuss this 

problem in the class. Having a speaker come in to address issues the class may have also 
gives children the feeling that they’re not alone. 

S4: They can teach kids more about it & how to prevent abuse. 

S5: Hard issue— teaching that violence/hitting is wrong is fine, but when kids see it happen at 

home, they may interpret it as OK. 

S6: Talk about the subject and let children know that it is something that they can talk about to a 

counselor or someone in the school. 

S7: Elementary teachers can talk to children and explain what domestic violence is. If any 

children want further information, they should be referred to a counselor. 

S8: Teachers can teach students that fighting and violence is never an option. Especially the 

boys. Teach respect for others. 

S9: Elementary teachers need to be cognizant of “signs” that children are living with a 

disfunctional family. Children who are scared to participate in class discussions, 
withdrawn into a shell, fear authority, etc. should be monitored closely, and social 
services via the principal made aware of the situation. Love, kindness, and patience are 
needed until the problems can be resolved. 

S10: Elementary teachers can try to produce a trusting atmosphere wherein students are 

comfortable sharing in a journal any problems or feelings they have. Most students will 
not tell, but good teachers will pick up on hints that something may be wrong. Then, the 
teachers should refer the student to the school psychologist 

S 1 1 : Teachers can educate people how to deal with this issue— if they are the victims, or if they 

know that a friend is in trouble. Also, teachers can instill good values & self esteem to lead 
to healthy-minded individuals.

Conclusions 



More than twice as many of the preservice teachers reported in this questionnaire format 
that they had personally been abused by a former male intimate than the national average (Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention, 1996). Physical abuse may be occurring among the 
preservice teachers to a much higher degree than twice the national average because of two other 
factors. One is the research of O’Leary, et al. (1992) which showed that personal interviews 
result in four times as many reports of abuse than questionnaire formats, as was used in this study. 
In addition, and alarmingly so, a well known phenomenon in social work is that when a person 
presents to a helping professional, they will frequently mask what is happening to them by saying 

“I have a friend who ” In this study of elementary education preservice teachers, five times as 

many (N = 15) of them reported that a friend or family member had been abused as they 
themselves reported personal abuse (N = 3). Finally, 40% of these preservice elementary teachers 
in science methods recommend that elementary teachers teach about domestic violence in the 
classroom, while only 10% reported that they themselves received their knowledge about it 
through education. 

Clearly there is cause for concern for elementary preservice teachers if this small study is 
indicative that (at least) more than twice the national average of incidence of domestic violence 
occurs among them. In addition, there is a glaring gap in the role education has played in the 
knowledge that these (mostly) young women have about domestic violence and the role of 
education they feel elementary teachers could play. Whereas only 10% of these preservice 
elementary teachers report receiving what knowledge they have about domestic violence in an 
educational setting, 40% report that elementary teachers can provide that education. Clearly, again, 
there is a role for curriculum development in this health care area for women and girls. 

One model for curriculum development exists that could be used as a guide. The National 
Association for Children of Alcoholics (NACOA) has developed numerous teaching units, video, 
lesson plans, and materials for elementary teachers in the last decade. The NACOA realized that 



children of alcoholics were “forgotten children” as described by Cork (1969) in a book by that 
name. Frequently, but not always, substance abuse is a factor in domestic violence. 



Violence in the presence of children is so traumatic, and may affect their learning to such a 
degree, that a separate training program and curriculum for teachers needs to be developed. We are 
just beginning to realize the prevalence of violence in our society; that is, many of us in education 
were removed from the scourge of the violence that today is present even in our schools. Those of 
us who hold the curriculum development keys should open the door to the discussion of violence 
in terms of the health of women and children. All of us know and have known that no learning can 
occur in the absence of safety; that is the bottom of the Maslow psychological needs model we 
learn as beginning teachers. Yet, none of us, like all the rest of society, wants to acknowledge the 
reality of the presence of violence among us, as indicated by reports (Allen, 1989) from the very 
teachers that we engage to study with us daily. 

Constructivists cannot ignore domestic violence just because it has been ignored in the past; 
we cannot begin to address the lived experiences of our teacher education students if two times the 
national average of them are or have experienced violence in their lives without acknowledging it in 
some way. Constructivists cannot ignore it because there is a stigma attached to even talking about 
it. Feminist theorists say that something has to be named to remove it from invisibility. This paper 
is a wake-up call that the issue of violence among teacher education candidates deserves a response 
from education researchers. Because health issues of women are legitimate topics of study in 
science, science education researchers should be involved in these curriculum development and 
research efforts. Finally, there are personal empowerment issues which surround all issues of 
abuse. The reform efforts in education are replete with calls for teacher empowerment. Perhaps 
personal empowerment should be given some attention before teachers are urged to change their 
practice. The data here suggest that many teachers may have far more urgent issues to address in 
their personal lives than those of classroom practice.

FACING THE CHALLENGES: FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE 
FACTORS INFLUENCING THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION 
OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT SCHOOLS 

Gail Shroyer, Kansas State University 

Melisa Hancock, Woodrow Wilson Elementary School, Manhattan-Ogden School 
District 

In 1986 the Holmes Group set out to: change the way they educate teachers, help construct 
a true profession of teaching, cooperate with school people in inquiry that transforms the schools, 
and restructure their own institutions to achieve these ends. Those of us involved in the Kansas 
State University - Manhattan-Ogden Professional Development Schools believe these are powerful 
goals for the improvement of schooling and teacher preparation. We also believe such endeavors 
are inherently difficult. In addressing these goals for mutual reform and improvement, several 
challenges have emerged. These challenges are related to the changing relationships between 
schools of education and school districts which are a natural consequence of implementing 
Professional Development Schools. 

Professional Development Schools 

The Professional Development School (PDS) is a key vehicle for creating communities of 
learners for the continuous development of our educational system. The PDS involves students, 
parents, preservice and inservice teachers, administrators, school board members, university 
faculty, and community representatives as educational stakeholders and members of the PDS 
community of learners. The PDS philosophy requires all such educational stakeholders to engage 
in inquiry and reflective practice to discover how to develop and maintain effective educational 
systems that support educational excellence and equity (Holmes, 1990; Richardson, 1994). 

The Holmes Group has defined PDS as regular schools working in partnership with a university to 
develop and demonstrate: fine learning programs for diverse students; practical, thought- 
provoking preparation for novice teachers; new understandings and professional responsibilities of 
experienced educators; and research projects that add to all educators knowledge about how to 
make schools more productive (Holmes Group, 1990). 




726 



The PDS is much more than a collection of people in a building. “It entails an attitude, a 
perspective, a professional predisposition that releases educators to share what they know and to 
improve the teaching of students and the preparation of future educators. It involves a willingness 
to ask questions about old habits and new trends and to suggest different ways of reaching old and 
new goals. Ultimately, the Professional Development School embodies a bent toward doing 
whatever is necessary to ensure that all children and youth become engaged learners under the 
tutelage of well-prepared teachers” (Richardson, 1994, p. 4). 

Six elementary and one high school PDS have been identified within the Manhattan-Ogden 
School District based on this vision. Currently, we are expanding our PDS model to include two 
local middle-schools and two additional elementary schools in neighboring rural and urban cities. 
All our PDS were established on the premise that education must be viewed as a continuum from 
preschool through university and that significant improvement in one part of this system is not 
likely without improvement throughout. As educators we cannot expect improvement in K-12 
schools until we improve the preparation of teachers and administrators; but, we cannot sustain 
even the best teachers and administrators until we have effective school systems. 

Our PDS model is based on the belief that teacher preparation and school reform are the 
joint responsibility of institutions of higher education and school systems. PDS participants have 
acknowledged that teacher preparation involves all groups of professionals who in any way touch 
the educational lives of teachers. Our aim is to create new roles for all participants to enhance the 
professional involvement of educators. This diversification of roles and responsibilities is a vital 
component of educational empowerment. 

We are implementing this belief by utilizing teachers, administrators, and faculty, as co- 
planners of courses and field experiences, seminar leaders, university co-instructors, evaluators, 
and supervisors and mentors of student teachers. Teachers, administrators, and faculty are jointly 
involved in school improvement efforts, curriculum development and program evaluation, 
professional development activities, and collaborative research projects. 





727 



Teacher preparation is an extremely complex process which must be viewed as a continuum 
of career-long experiences which mold and shape the ever changing behaviors of the classroom 
teacher. Our PDS have permitted us to restructure our teacher preparation from this complex, 
holistic perspective as opposed to disjointed, incremental reform efforts. The PDS facilitate 
systematic field experiences within realistically complex environments. These experiences have 
become a unifying feature of our students’ education by integrating content and pedagogy and 
providing a sense of relevancy for their studies. 

We intend for our PDS to be sites where teachers, students and university faculty create 
new knowledge and try-out, evaluate and revise practices. Our PDS have become living 
laboratories for study, observation, experimentation, and extended practice. We are researching 
new instructional strategies, curriculum materials and teacher preparation techniques under a 
variety of working conditions. Our intention is to explore how children leam, how teachers learn 
and how schools improve. Professional development opportunities offered within PDS have been 
designed to provide educators with the knowledge, skills, attitudes and resources to empower them 
to create teaching and learning environments to meet the needs of an increasingly diverse student 
population. Examples of such opportunities are school-based seminars and study groups where 
future and practicing teachers reflect on their teaching and learning with peers, administrators, and 
university faculty. 

Ultimately, PDS should exemplify the most current and best practices education has to 
offer. Classroom experimentation has included action research projects and "innovations in 
action". These experiences with collaborative inquiry have involved pilot testing and field testing 
new curriculum, technology, innovative teaching, and assessment techniques. Action research 
projects have been conducted to examine educational equity, parental attitudes, school change, and 
various indicators of school quality. Examples of "innovations in action" include: developing 
non-routine mathematical problem solving curricula; thematic teaching; peer coaching; team 
teaching; multi-age classrooms; and, alternative assessment strategies including authentic 
assessment, portfolios, non-graded report cards, and student-lead parent conferences. 



This climate of experimentation and risk taking has also extended to the university where 
faculty are taking on new roles and trying out new practices. This has helped to create an active 
problem-solving mentality and a shared commitment to improving education at all levels. 

The fundamental purpose for our PDS is to capitalize on the collaborative inclinations, 
experiences, and needs of the many educational partners in our community to demonstrate how to 
help students achieve high academic standards and enhance the quality of teaching as a profession 
at all levels of schooling. 

The Challenges 

Implementing PDS demands a high level of collaboration that can result in a great many challenges 
for all partners. “Professional development schools (PDSs) are organizations that cannot be 
created by either public schools or universities acting alone. They grow out of and depend upon 
collaboration for their very existence. Each partner brings a critical element to the 
relationship.. .joint work between these two kinds of organizations can produce cooperation, but it 
requires each to stretch to meet the other different, if not antagonistic, party” (Robinson & Darling- 
Hammond, 1994). The trials and tribulations of implementing PDS since 1989 has resulted in the 
identification of the following major challenges for collaboration and suggestions for addressing 
these challenges. These challenges and suggestions represent the concerns, perspectives, and 
recommendations of principals, teachers, clinical instructors, and university instructors involved 
within our PDS. 

Cultural Clashes 

Seymour Sarason described in 1984 what our participants have identified as a major 
challenge to implementing PDS, “I had come to see these collaborations as instances of ‘two 
cultures’ interacting - that is, two cultures misunderstanding and clashing with each other” ( p. 19). 
Robinson and Darling-Hammond (1994), summarize the factors that distinguish the cultures of 
public schools and universities as the uses of time, differences in norms and work styles, and 
traditions regarding status. Participants must work very hard to understand and appreciate one 
another. Plans should be made to discuss differences in norms, values, and beliefs of both 



organizations. The culture of each university and school will be different and they all can offer 
unique strengths while also creating limitations for the partnership. Participants should strive 
toward developing a blended PDS culture based on the best of both worlds. To do so, participants 
need the opportunity to study, plan, teach, reflect, and socialize with one another. 

Patterns of Power Relationships 

“Any educational reform that does not explicitly and courageously own up to issues 
surrounding changing patterns of power relationship is likely to fail. That prediction is based on 
the feckless consequences of educational reform in the past half-century.” (Sarason, 1991). 

Perhaps the greatest challenge we have faced while implementing PDS is addressing the issues of 
status, power and control inherent in our educational systems. We have a long history of well 
established roles, expectations, and perceptions which serve to separate teachers from students and 
their parents; while also separating practicing teachers “in the trenches” from teacher educators “in 
the ivory tower”. These established roles clearly differentiate the expected behavior and domains 
of control of each group and our perceptions create inequality of status, mistrust and at times even 
antagonism. Teacher educators perceive that they have the theoretical knowledge, access to 
research and the right to determine the future of teacher education. Practicing teachers perceive that 
they have the wisdom of practice, the experience, and the right to determine the future of education 
in practice. Neither group has adequately addressed the rights of students, parents, or other 
community members. The informal status hierarchy places teacher educators in a position superior 
to teachers and all teachers are assumed superior to their students. All of these educational 
stakeholders, in subtle and not so subtle ways, challenge the knowledge, the experience, the 
practices, the status, and the rights of the others. 

Genuine partnerships can only be created when we examine and challenge the expectations 
and the perceptions which support traditional patterns of power in our relationships. Teachers 
must be encouraged to utilize the enormous latent power they possess to reclaim teaching as a 
profession and to become active participants and decision makers in all aspects of the educational 
system. Students must also be empowered to become responsible for their own learning and the 



improvement of their educational system. And teachers, teacher educators, parents, and 
community members must become informed, reflective, responsible, contributing members of the 
learning community. 

Facing The Challenges 

A critical component of our ability to establish a successful collaboration has been our 
collective focus on organizational self-analysis and problem solving. This focus has allowed us to 
face the challenges we have been presented with and to find ways to address such challenges. The 
strategies which we feel have guided and enhanced our collaborative planning and decision-making 
process are synthesized into the following recommendations and trouble shooting guidelines for 
educators in a PDS. 

Create Genuine Partnerships Where All Participants Can Learn. Improve, and Grow Together as a 
Community of Learners. 

Collaborative partnerships must be created between all educational stakeholders including: 
practicing teachers, preservice teachers, teacher educators, administrators, paraprofessionals, 
children, parents, community members, social service agencies, and any other educational 
colleagues. This collaboration develops ownership among stakeholders and provides extra 
resources in terms of people, ideas, experiences, and support needed to meet the challenges 
educators must face as they help all students learn and strive to enhance the quality of teaching as a 
profession at all levels of schooling. 

Establish New Collaborative Roles and Responsibilities for all Professional Educators 

New creative relationships must be established between schools of education and school 
districts. Roles for teachers, teacher educators, and administrators within schools and colleges of 
education must be expanded and boundaries between these traditionally separated roles must be 
blurred. All educators should view themselves as reflective practitioners, curriculum developers, 
program planners, evaluators, researchers, decision makers, and change agents; responsible for 
themselves but also for one another and for teaching as a profession.

Enhance Ownership. Participation and Communication 



Educators are busy people who never seem to have enough time. In an attempt to limit time 
commitments and extra demands on participants, it is easy to inadvertently select strategies which 
limit ownership, participation and communication. No one wants an extra meeting or another 
committee to join. But collaborative projects live or die by participants’ involvement in all aspects 
of the project. All participants must feel respected and valued and have a sense that this is “their 
project”. Their voices must be heard, their concerns and suggestions taken seriously, and they 
must be a part of all major decisions. Multiple communication strategies should be established so 
all participants are constantly informed of project activities, planning sessions, and pending 
decisions. Major planning and decision making should be conducted by committees which 
represent all stakeholders. We have found it helpful to establish an advisory board for each PDS to 
coordinate within school activities and an overarching board to coordinate activities and 
communication across schools. We have numerous committees and meetings. The PDS 
coordinator and the clinical instructor from each PDS meet at least every other week. We also have 
established newsletters and handbooks within each PDS. Additional strategies to enhance 
ownership, participation, and communication can be found in the 1996-1997 PDS Goals attached 
to this paper. 

Ownership, participation and communication ensure that project goals are beneficial for all, 
enhance commitment, and help to establish a collaborative problem solving culture. Participants 
must plan for many opportunities to create a shared sense of responsibility for personal, 
organizational, and professional growth. These opportunities take additional time and effort but 
our experiences demonstrate that they are absolutely essential. The following Trouble Shooting 
Guide was developed by a PDS principal, Teresa Miller, to offer additional suggestions for 
effectively implementing PDS. 

Trouble Shooting Guide for Educators in a PDS 

1 . Remember that each member of the partnership is very important, needs to be valued by all, 
and needs to hear about his/her accomplishments. 




732 



755 



2. Remember that parents and students are partners in the project too. Give them opportunities to 
express their concerns, opinions, and suggestions. 

3. Advertise often that the PDS is mutually beneficial and help all stakeholders see those benefits. 

4. Gather data to show the benefits of PDS, especially those related to students. 

5. Anticipate problems and be proactive in avoiding them whenever possible. 

6. Remind participants that every solution has a problem. There will be difficulties, but they need 
not derail the project. Approach difficulties as problems to be solved and encourage group 
participation in finding those solutions. Remind participants that we will always be 
“becoming”, that this is an evolving process. 

7. Keep communication lines open so that participants feel able to confide in you when they need 
help in understanding the project. 

8. Pay attention to your building culture. Maintain a building goal of being growth oriented. 

9. Public school and university cultures are not alike. Work very hard to understand the culture 
of both entities and translate the differences to your staff members. 

10. People who work together need to like each other. To like each other, they need to have plenty 
of opportunities to get to know each other. Find creative ways to get collaborative time for 
planning, teaching, and socializing. 

We recommend that other institutions involved in a reform agenda consider these 
challenges and how to address them while considering their own unique sets of strengths, 
weaknesses, and environmental and social circumstances. Through the development of PDS and 
attention to these challenges, the Kansas State University's teacher preparation program has been 
enhanced, the teaching skills of participating teachers and faculty have been improved, and new 
collaborative relationships have been established between the College of Arts and Sciences, the 
College of Education, the Manhattan-Ogden Public Schools, and the local Manhattan community. 

“For teachers as well as for students trying something new often means initially 
experiencing discomfort. It may mean getting worse before getting better. The perseverance 
needed to get beyond adequate performance to efficient, graceful form can be staggering. Teachers

need to feel comfortable with their discomfort, knowing that they are supported in their growth” 
(Loucks-Horsley, 1987, p 9-10). We can not say that we have reached the efficient or graceful 
form of teaching through Professional Development Schools, but we have learned to become 
comfortable with our discomfort and to appreciate our own growth, the growth of novice and 
expert teachers practicing at KSU and within the PDS, and the growth of our collaborative teacher 
preparation program.

Teaching Teachers to Teach Technology Through TIES 

Walter S. Smith, The University of Akron 

Teachers of African American and Native American third through sixth graders are learning 
through the three year, NSF-funded TIES (Technology and Invention in Elementary Schools) 
Project to improve their teaching of technology (in the sense of applied science, as opposed to 
computers, etc.) along with invention and problem solving. TIES involves a cooperative venture 
between (1) schools serving a large minority population (Akron, Barberton, and Canton, Ohio, 
plus Bureau of Indian Affairs schools in New Mexico), (2) the University of Akron, (3) an infor- 
mal science center (Inventure Place: Home of the National Inventors Hall of Fame), (4) four For- 
tune 500 companies (BF Goodrich, GenCorp, Monsanto, and A. Shulman), (5) an environmental 
education center in a national recreation area (Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area), (6) a 
federal research laboratory (Sandia National Laboratories), and (7) the inventors of the magnetron, 
fiber optics, electron microscope, and pacemaker. 

Instruction occurs over a four week period each summer at the recently-opened, informal 
science center. Inventure Place, with follow-up during the subsequent school year on site at each 
school. TIES was planned and is guided by a team of teachers and science supervisors, university 
scientists and science educators, and informal science center education personnel. 

Teachers attend TIES in teams of four from the same building so that during the following 
year they may be supportive of each other during implementation and so that they may instruct their 
fellow teachers in the skills learned in TIES. At Inventure Place teachers receive instruction aimed

at teaching their students the following Benchmarks and National Standards: 

• Technology has always been a part of human life. In fact, regardless of Jane Goodall's 
studies of chimpanzees, one distinguishing feature of humans is their pervasive use of 
tools. (Other animals use tools; but humans do so consistently.) 

• Via technology a wide variety of processes and products are available to solve human 
problems. 

• There is no perfect process or product; these change over time as problems change and 
as new solutions are developed. 

• Even good designs fail, so steps such as pretesting, building in redundancy, and over- 
designing can be used to reduce failure. 

• Solving one problem frequently leads to other problems (and opportunities). 

• From some perspectives, technologies have improved human lives; but from other per- 
spectives, technologies do not always lead to improvement. 

• Technologies involve costs and benefits; there are always trade-offs such as safety, effi- 
ciency, effectiveness and appearance to consider. 

• Development of technologies frequently have intended and unintended consequences. 

• Technologies always operate within constraints, some of which are imposed by nature 
(e.g., friction, gravity, and characteristics of the materials being used) and some of 
which are imposed by society (e.g., environmental, economic, and safety issues). 

• Development of technologies frequently progresses through identifying a problem, 
proposing a solution, implementing the solution, evaluating the implementation, and 
communicating results. 

• Women and men of all ages, ethnicities, educational levels, and so forth, are involved in 
science and technology. 

• T earn work is f requendy involved in technology. 

TIES instruction takes major advantage of the Inventure Place resources, including lasers, 
electromagnetics, strobes, and so forth. Instruction is divided into ten units, each of which is 



738 



ERIC 




named for one of the National Inventors Hall of Fame inductees. Following are the names of the 
units, the numbers of days of instruction for each, the invention of the honoree, the TIES activity, 
and the unit's application in teaching. 

• Gertrude Elion unit (2 days). 

Invention : A Nobel Prize winner, she invented several drugs used in treatment of such diseases 
as leukemia and in facilitating kidney transplants. 

Activity : Using GEMS' Of Cabbages and Chemistry (Great Explorations in Math and Science, 
1991a) for grades 4-8, students will test materials' pH. COMETS Science (Smith, 1984) will 
be used to make connections to Rosalyn Yalow, who won the Nobel Prize for radioim- 
munoassey, another testing process. 

Application: Teachers will visit the production facilities of A. Shulman, a Fortune 500 company 
who make plastic pellets that are manufactured into a multitude of products and especially 
learn about Shulman's extensive on-site testing activities so that they might use this 
information in their classrooms. 

• Stephanie Kwolek unit (3 days). 

Invention : Polymers such as Kevlar, six times stronger than an equal weight of steel, used in 
bullet-proof vests. 

Activity : Using GEMS' Bubble Festival (Great Explorations in Math and Science, 1992) for 
grades K-6, teachers will investigate various bubble making formula to test for strength of 
their products. A second inventor, Waldo Semon, will be introduced here for his particular 
appeal to students — he invented both polyvinyl chloride (the pervasive PVC) and bubble 
gum! 

Application: Teachers will learn about the learning cycle and then apply the learning cycle at a 
Saturday morning inventors workshop for students from grades 3-6. 



James Hillier unit (2 days). 

Invention : Electron microscope. 

Activity : Using FOSS's "Ideas and Invention," (Full Option Science System, 1993) a 

third/fourth grade unit, the teachers will investigate the unknown through rubbings, carbon 
printing, color writing, and reflection. Then they will use the microscope, a technology that 
supports scientific investigation, as another tool for studying the unknown. 

Application : After this activity the teachers will converse with James Hillier about the process 
he went through to develop the electron microscope. 

Henry Ford unit (1 day). 

Invention : Improvements on auto transmission; but best remembered for devising mass pro- 
duction processes that greatly reduced the time needed to make a car. 

Activity: Teachers will do activities from "The World in Motion," provided by the Society of 
Automotive Engineers, of which Ford was an early officer, and learn to use this resource in 
conjunction with engineers and technicians from their own communities. 

An Wang unit (2 days). 

Invention : Improvements in computer memory. 

Activity : Using "Electrically Speaking" from COMETS Science , teachers will learn about elec- 
tromagnets and use Inventure Place's electromagnet workbench to explore their properties. 

Application : Building on the learning cycle instruction from the Stephanie Kwolek unit, the 
teachers will learn about authentic assessment procedures that can be used to assess inquiry 
learning. 

Charles Steinmetz unit (2 days). 

Invention : After immigrating from Germany, Steinmetz worked through his severely crippled 
condition to develop the underlying theories of alternating current, the basis of our power 
industry. 

Activity : Teachers will continue "Electrically Speaking" activities from COMETS Science with 
particular attention to motors that apply alternating current. 



Application : Teachers will be teamed together to learn about and then make plans for their CILC 
(Cooperative Invention Learning Corporation). 

Willis Carrier unit (3.5 days). 

Invention : Air conditioner. 

Activity : Using GEMS' Hot Water and Warm Homes (Great Explorations in Math and Science, 
1991b) for grades 4-8, teachers will investigate energy flow, especially within the home. 
Here and elsewhere, Macaulay's The Wav Things Work ( 1988) will serve as a reference. 

Application : Teachers will spend three days at the Cuyahoga Valley Environmental Education 
Center in water testing and so forth, particularly learning about intended and unintended con- 
sequences of technology which can have both benefits and costs for the environment. 

George Washington Carver unit (2.5 days). 

Invention : Developed successful crop rotation processes for poor farmers; but then, out of the 
necessity of needing to find a market for peanuts, one of the crops in the rotation, developed 
over 300 uses for the peanut. 

Activity : Using "Product Improvement" from COMETS Science, teachers will develop new 
uses of some common materials, including Elmer's Glue . 

Application : In small groups for two days, teachers will shadow the R&D personnel at Mon- 
santo, GenCorp, or Goodrich and, under the direction of these workers, engage in a project 
that illustrates the development work of those industries. 

Wilson Greatbach unit (1.5 days). 

Invention : Pacemaker. 

Activity : Using "Systems and Analysis," a fourth grade unit from BSCS's Science for Life and 
Living: Integrating Science, Technology and Health, Biological Science Curriculum Study 
(1992). Dubuque, I A: Kendall/Hunt Publishing, at Inventure Place's workbenches teachers 
will invent something and assess its effectiveness, thereby learning that "failure" can still 
have benefits and that problems can have multiple solutions. 



Application : After this activity the teachers will converse with Wilson Greatbach about the pro- 
cess he went through to develop the Pacemaker and continues to use to make improvements. 

• Percy Julian unit (2.5 days). 

Invention : Prior to artificial cortisone's development, natural cortisone, the only available form, 
was more valuable than an equal weight of gold. His development of artificial cortisone was 
honored on a U.S. stamp in the Black Heritage series. 

Activity : Teachers will make models of human joints which in certain afflictions are relieved by 
cortisone. 

Application : Teachers will develop units that apply the instruction they have been receiving and 
are designed to teach project content objectives. (Teachers will not be asked to completely re- 
invent the wheel. Their units will liberally rely on materials -- i.e., GEMS, FOSS, BSCS, 
COMETS - used in TIES.) 

TIES has been influenced in a major way by the work of Dunn and Larson (1990) 
regarding design technology; and their vision of a design technology classroom is reflected in the 
instruction provided for TIES teachers. Dunn and Larson envision a classroom something like a 
workplace with workers (i.e., students) engaged at workbenches as teams. They are pursuing 
solutions - as opposed to answers - to problems posed by the teacher or the students themselves. 
The problems are practical rather than theoretical. For example, the students may be challenged to 
make a wind driven land racer that most rapidly moves across the room driven by a fan and also is 
portable from school to home and back without being broken. And when the race is over the 
vehicles must be edible ! 

Students have tools and materials at their disposal. They have paper and pencil with which 
to compose their solutions prior to taking tool in hand. They work as teams on their design and 
manufacturing tasks. They receive immediate feedback about the success of their ideas — it works 
or it doesn't — and they have a basis for going back to the drawing board and modifying what they 
have produced. 





742 



Their work throughout the year progresses from problem to problem rather than from sub- 
ject to subject When difficulties arise in their pursuit of a solution, the teacher guides them to new 
skills that will help them -- and surprise, they are learning something else that is part of the 
school's curriculum. 

TIES participants spend two to three days in the workplace at the Fortune 500 companies 
learning how the skills they are learning to teach are applied on the job. Further, participants spend 
three days at the Cuyahoga Valley Environmental Education Center in the Cuyahoga Valley 
National Recreation Area learning about positive and negative effects of technology on the envi- 
ronment Recall that about 25 years ago the Cuyahoga River caught on fire in Cleveland and could 
not be extinguished for several days. This incident accelerated the development of a national 
recreation area along the Cuyahoga The river's health has noticeably improved. Technology can 
have both positive and negative consequences. 

Each summer two inventors of, e.g., the electron microscope and the pacemaker, infor- 
mally interact for a day with the teachers so they learn first hand about how honored inventors 
problem solve. During the subsequent year TIES instructors, supported in New Mexico by sci- 
ence educators from Sandia National Laboratories, visit each teacher at least four times, doing 
everything from teaching demonstration lessons, to co-teaching, to observing and providing feed- 
back, depending on the teachers' needs. 

TIES has woven together research on (1) encouraging underrepresented students in sci- 
ence, (2) teaching and learning problem solving skills needed in a post-industrial, global economy, 
and (3) changing the practices of science teachers. For example, based on the work of Kahle 
(1985), Lockheed (1985), Smith and Erb (1986), and Smith (1991) nine Cardinal Principles for 
encouraging underrepresented students in science are applied, including: 

• Teach science through firsthand (hands-on) experience, applying a constructivist 
approach. 

• Reorganize instruction to encourage cooperative leaminR . 




743 



76 * 



• Actively encourage underrepresented students to engage in science, math, and computer 



activities in and out of school. 

• Use language the students understand during instruction. 

• Develop students’ positive evaluations of their own competence in science. 

• Make science people oriented by emphasizing science topics that focus on personal utility 
and the altruistic/nurturing value of science. 

• Bring aesthetic appreciation into science. 

• Capitalize on girls' interest in and mastery of oral and written skills by including language 
activities and classroom discussions in science. 

• Incorporate community resources in instruction. 

TIES has been designed to apply seven characteristics of science programs that both teach 
and apply problem solving in science, including: 

• Start with practical problems; then move to causality issues. Children's interest in sci- 
ence experiments is heightened by starting in an engineering mode in which students 
investigate practical problems and then over time move to a scientific mode that focuses 
on causal relationships (Schauble, Klopfer, & Raghavan, 1991). 

• Problems need to be "practical" from the students' perspective. Children's problem 
solving skills are enhanced, if they feel ownership of the problem — i.e., they see the 
problem as relevant (Pizzini, Shepardson, & Abell, 1989). 

• Discrepant events with student questions and teacher guidance support problem solving. 
Discrepant events, accompanied by ( 1) student-generated questions and (2) teacher guid- 
ance on how to ask productive questions, support development of both problem solving 
skills and understanding of the topic at hand (Barr, 1994). 

• Children should be reflective about their problem solving efforts. Children's problem 
solving is improved, if they (1) are led by the teacher to reflect on the strategies they used 
to solve the problem and (2) they have standards by which they can evaluate their per- 
formance (Barr, 1994). 





744 



• Working in cooperative groups enhances problem solving. Cooperative groups in which 
students together investigate questions, propose and test hypotheses, and draw conclu- 
sions enhance development of both problem solving skills and understanding of the topic 
at hand (Johnson & Johnson, 1987). 

• Hands-on, process-oriented instruction yield higher achievement than textbook-oriented 
teaching. Regardless of teacher experience and school location, contrary to "back to 
basics," elementary students enrolled in process-oriented classrooms enjoy higher aca- 
demic achievement than students in textbook-oriented classrooms (Shymansky, Hedges 
& Woodworth, 1990; Shymansky, Kyle & Alport, 1983). 

• Academically or economically disadvantaged students appear to gain the most from 
activity-based elementary science programs (Bredderman, 1982). 

Finally, TIES takes into account research on the change process in education. In this 
regard we were very influenced by Taking Charge of Change by Hord, etal. (1987) and their 
Concems-Based Adoption Model. Further, Mohling (1993) found that professional development 
in science for elementary teachers of American Indians required both a period of instruction and an 
extended period of application before the teachers' primary concern moved from self concerns to 
concerns about the effectiveness of the innovation.

MENTORING THE BEGINNING SCIENCE TEACHER: 
FACILITATING THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
A REFLECTIVE PRACTITIONER 

Jeanie Roberson, Vanderbilt University 
Margaret W. Smithey, Vanderbilt University 
Carolyn M. Evertson, Vanderbilt University 

Induction Programs and The Needs of the Beginning Teacher 

New teachers enter the classroom with idealistic expectations about students, classrooms and 
teaching, but the transition from student to first-year teacher promptly shocks them into reality 
(Gold, 1992). Research has shown that the first few years of teaching can influence the quality 
and professional growth of the novice teacher for the rest of their teaching career (Huling- Austin, 
1990; Odell, 1989). “Without a bridge between theory and full professional practice and 
responsibility, learning on the job remains hit and miss, inefficient and painful, and the experience 
of entering the teaching profession continues to be largely a matter of sink or swim” (Johnson, 
Ratsoy, Holdaway, & Friesen, 1993, p. 298). It is clear that novice teachers need careful and 
systematic assistance during the beginning of their careers (Berliner, 1985; Johnston & Ryan, 

1983; Veenman, 1984; Thies-Sprinthall, 1990). 

Researchers have documented the perils of novice teachers who are not adequately supported 
during the first year of teaching. Providing support and assistance to new teachers is needed to 
change the tradition of “isolation, survival, and trial-and-error learning” (Feiman-Nemser, 1983; 
Wildman, Niles, Magliaro, & McLaughlin, 1989). Currently over 31 states have implemented 
mentoring and/or induction programs. The aims of these programs are to “retain and induct novice 
teachers, reward and revitalize experienced teachers, and to increase professional efficacy” 

(Huling- Austin, 1989, p. 5). These induction programs have contributed to the educational system 
in the following ways: improved retention of teachers, increased positive attitudes toward 
teaching, and improved performance of teachers (Smithey & Evertson, 1995; Feiman-Nemser & 
Parker, 1992; Huling-Austin, 1990; Klug & Salzman, 1991; Yosha, 1991).

Effective mentoring programs are designed around what leaming-to-teach research has revealed 
about novice teachers’ needs. Well-designed “mentoring interventions” assess the level of teacher 
development of the novice teacher and then facilitate the development of teacher expertise through 
construction of a teaching knowledge framework. This framework can be used by the protege to 
reframe their “novice” experiences from a more “expert” perspective (Odell, 1989). While this 
information provides the needed base for continued development of induction programs, further 
research is needed to provide field-based data regarding individual mentors’ contributions to 
interns’ learning to teach. Such information is essential if we are to understand how a supportive 
mentoring environment may contribute and even transform the process of learning to teach. 

Guiding Question 

Specifically in the context of science education, the findings generated from this study 
contribute to a more in-depth understanding of the trials and tribulations of beginning science 
teachers. Further, this study also contributes to an understanding of how a mentor can help his or 
her protege make the transition from “science student” to “science teacher.” Therefore, the 
guiding question of this study was, “How does an experienced science teacher (mentor) help a 
beginning teacher (protege) leam to teach?” 



Methodology 

To answer this question, a mentor/intem pair was observed four days a week for one semester. 
On a typical day the researcher would arrive at 6:45 a.m. and leave when the mentor or intern left at 
the end of the school day. 

Intemship/Induction Program 

The intern was enrolled in an intemship/induction program at a southern university. This 
program allows college graduates to earn a master’s degree plus certification to teach in 14 months. 
Interns are required to teach for a semester at two placements, i.e., one semester at a high school 
placement and one semester at a middle school placement. They share a classroom with an 
experienced mentor teacher who guides and facilitates the leaming-to-teach process. The mentors 




749 



participate in a week long inquiry-based workshop during the summer prior to having the interns 
share their classrooms. They also attend follow-up meetings twice during the semester. 
Participants 

The intern, Mike (pseudo-name), had graduated from an ivy-league school with a bachelor of 
science degree in biochemistry and took two education courses while he was there. After 
graduating, Mike spent one year in Europe teaching at a boarding school. He taught three classes 
including physics, algebra, and biology. After returning to the United States, he worked for two 
years as a program director for a summer camp before applying to the internship program. 

The mentor, Carol (pseudo-name), had taught science for 27 years. Her experience included 
elementary, middle, and high school level teaching. She was the recipient of many honors and 
awards, including the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science Teaching, the Tandy National 
Scholars Award, and the Presidential Distinguished Scholar Award. She was highly 
recommended by the director of science and health for the public school system of this southern 
city. He referred to her as the best science teacher in the county. During this research study she 
taught Honors Biology, Advanced Placement Biology, and Anatomy and Physiology. Carol also 
had extensive experience with teaching adults through conducting inservice workshops and 
through serving as a cooperating teacher for student teachers. 

Data Collection and Analysis 

The data analyzed in this study included field notes from observations, transcripts from video 
and audio tapes of interviews and observations, a dialog journal kept by the intern and mentor, a 
reflective journal kept by the intern, lesson plans and other intern-generated class materials, and 
email messages written by the intern to the researchers. Methods of qualitative data analysis (Borg 
& Gall, 1989; Lincoln & Guba, 1985; Miles & Huberman, 1994) were used from the beginning of 
data collection in order to facilitate the emergent design, grounding of theory, and the direction of 
later data collection phases. The researchers used the Constant Comparative Method developed by 
Glaser and Strauss (1967) to focus on the specifics that made the context unique and to generate 
the information upon which the emergent design and grounded theory could be based. 




750 



Findings 

Six mentor functions emerged from the data analysis that appear to have been essential for this 
mentor to effectively facilitate the growth of a beginning science teacher: gate-keeper, 
model/guide, reflective practitioner, co-planner, co-teacher, and co-leamer. Each function was 
used by the mentor in a unique way to help the intern navigate the dilemmas and decision points 
that comprise the complexity of teaching. 

Gate-keeper 



The beginning teacher, in essence, is entering a foreign land and the mentor serves as a 
gate-keeper to that land. As a gate-keeper, the mentor performs functions such as giving the intern 
a tour of the building and introducing him to key people or describing the history, culture, and 
politics of the school. 

In her role as gate-keeper, Carol was open, honest, and inviting. She first opened the door for 

her intern to her students and her classroom. Mike described this when he said, 

“She (Carol) immediately included me in her thoughts. From the simplest thing 
such as writing my name along with hers on the syllabus to asking me what I was 
interested in helping her with. The whole process was completely open. She gave 
me permission to ask questions directly and she was honest in sharing her own 
nervousness in having someone else in the classroom with her, which makes the 
whole year seem much more a team effort where both of us will learn. She set her 
expectations clearly, but without ever making me feel that I was on the outside of 
them. We talked about how she deals with students, past history of the school, the 
school culture, and the atmosphere she tries to establish in her classes. This was 
extremely helpful in providing me with some idea of what to expect on the first day 
of school. ” 

Carol also opened the door to the school and its traditions and she helped pave the way for 
Mike’s acceptance by the faculty. 

“I met with Carol at 9:00 A.M. and she showed me the building and her classroom. 

We then sat and talked about the history of the school, the make up of the students 
and traditions of the school. Before I even realized it, two hours had past. The 
atmosphere was light, excited about the coming year, and open for sharing ideas 
and personalities. ” 

The first faculty meeting of the year occurred the next day where Carol introduced Mike to the 
faculty and made sure that he met the key people of the school, i.e., the principals, the secretaries, 
and the janitors. As the semester progressed she continued to open doors for Mike by suggesting 




75i 774 BEST COPY AVAILABLE 



his name for special projects and encouraging him to serve on committees and participate in other 
activities that would look good on his resume. 

Another door that was opened was one of friendship. Mike described this when he said, 

“ From inviting me to dinner and a concert to simply talking on the phone regularly, 
she has quickly become a friend. She is the type of person who invites people into 
her life. She is a swirl of energy that is a whirlwind and a calm lake all in one. ” 

Typical of many first year teachers, Mike was alone and in a new city, away from family and 

friends. As a mentor, Carol took the time to show compassion and caring for this young teacher 

and began to build trust and friendship with her protege. 

Mentors can open gates to the school, students, parents, and other faculty members for their 
proteges. Without the benefit of a gate-keeper new teachers may have to endure some painful 
experiences before they learn the idiosyncrasies of the school’s culture. By introducing the protege 
to key people and informing the new teacher of the culture and politics of the school, the mentor 
can help prevent mishaps and misunderstandings and help smooth the beginning teacher’s entry 
into this foreign land. The function of gate-keeper is especially important during the beginning 
stages of the mentor/intem relationship. Equally important is the role of model/guide. By 
watching master teachers in action, novice teachers gain insights into the craft of teaching and are 
able to tap into the wisdom and experience of those teachers as they demonstrate and unpack the 
complexity of teaching. 

Model/Guide 

As a model/guide, the experienced science teacher demonstrates the full spectrum of thinking, 
decision making, and actions that occur in a science teacher’s professional life. This spectrum 
ranges from the intricacies of planning ahead for science labs so that supplies will be available 
when needed, to developing a classroom climate that is conducive to critical thinking and 
risk-taking. 

Planning for the beginning of the school year can be overwhelming for the beginning teacher. 
Mike expressed how beneficial it was to see how Carol prepared for the beginning of school. The 
following dialogue was from one of their first meetings before school started.

Carol: First of all we need to set up a filing system. Each class will have a different color so 
that at a glance you can tell if everything is filed right. We will have one set of folders 
for the students’ use and one set for our use. We color them by the rainbow so the first 
period will be red, second period orange, yellow, green, and blue. Independent study 
and student assistants will be purple. Our set of folders will be used to document 
behavior problems or even study problems. The students’ set of folders will be for 
absentee work. When they are absent we will put any dittos or activities that they 
missed in their folder. It will be their responsibility to look in their folder as soon as 
they get back to check for work they have missed. I also suggest to my students to find 
a buddy in each class. This needs to be a person that pays attention, not necessarily 
your best friend. Make sure and get his or her telephone number so that you have 
someone to contact if you are absent. It is the students ’ responsibility to make up their 
work within three days after they return, never more than a week. Another way we will 
help the students keep up is by putting out calendars each month with assignments, long 
term projects, and tentative test dates. Because this is an academic magnet, students can 
very quickly become overwhelmed by the number of assignments, so I try to encourage 
them from the beginning to be proactive and plan ahead to keep from getting behind. 

Carol went on to discuss decisions that must be made such as when to hand back tests when 

students are absent, how to encourage students to use their time wisely, and how to help ninth 

graders acclimate to high school. They also discussed such issues as lab fees, ordering lab 

supplies, and how to pass out textbooks. 

The administration at Carol’s high school had made the decision to try block scheduling which 
involved classes meeting every other day. Carol helped Mike think through the various 
implications of this type of scheduling. 

Carol: Planning for an hour and forty-five minute class is a whole different ball game than 
planning for a 45 minute class. You have to vary the activities to keep their attention. 
Also because in a normal week we will be seeing them every other day, we may want to 
have them take tests before school, during lunch, during independent study, or after 
school so that it doesn ’t take up so much class time. In weeks that we have field trips 
and special programs there could be large gaps of time between when we see certain 
classes and therefore it becomes very important that they have a clear understanding of 
what we expect from them. 

Throughout the semester, Mike expressed how much he was learning by watching Carol teach. 
Carol tends to use the Socratic method to lead discussions. She has developed an incredible style 
of asking questions that help the students move beyond superficial learning. In one journal entry 
Mike wrote: 

While I was teaching in Europe I felt a duty to cover the content almost to the point 
of losing sight of the broader goals of self-esteen, personal reflection, and deeper 
understandings of an interconnectedness with the world that we live in. Carol has 
successfully combined these elements, much is because of her ability to concept map in her 
head. From her years of experience, she has built frameworks of content and life-changing 



O 

ERIC 



753 



questions which she can access at will. Already this has influenced me to ask deeper 
questions about the content I am studying to teach. 

Another area that Mike described as invaluable was seeing Carol plan for, carry out, and 
evaluate laboratory experiences. She attempted to unpack and describe every detail of planning for 
a lab, i.e. ordering supplies, setting up the lab, designing questions that prime the students’ 
thinking without giving them the answers, facilitating and managing students’ learning during the 
lab and evaluating students learning during and after the lab. 

At the beginning of the semester Carol spent a lot of time modeling for Mike. This seemed 
important to help Mike get an idea of how things worked. Once he started teaching, Carol became 
more of a guide and resource especially in helping Mike reflect on his teaching. 

Reflective Practitioner 

Modeling is not enough; the mentor must provide opportunities for the intern to discuss the 
whys and hows of what has become second nature to the experienced teacher. Reflective 
discourse about students, effective teaching strategies which support students’ construction of 
knowledge, and classroom management are invaluable to beginning science teachers. 

During their planning session, Carol asked Mike to call role before each class on the first day of 
school. Mike had asked the students to tell something interesting about themselves when he called 
out their name. Because of the class size this was taking much too long. Between classes Mike 
asked Carol what he should do. Together they quickly brain stormed some alternative methods 
and he chose to have the students give an adjective that best described themselves. Mike described 
this in his journal: 

“Today in class / realized something was not working the way I wanted. I talked to Carol 
about changing it, and then proceeded to correct it for the next period. Having the chance 
to meld thoughts on the spot with someone so dynamic has opened my eyes to new ways 
of teaching. ” 

On other occasions Mike would ask Carol about the “whys” behind her teaching and decision 

making. After reflecting with Carol, Mike wrote this in his journal: 

While / need organization for myself as I am new to teaching, Carol has intuitively done 
this. Some of our working together will involve my getting her to verbalize these intuitions 
so that I can gain not only the information but also the process of internalizing the 

organization. 



Once Mike began teaching Carol would sit down with him during planning period or sometimes 
immediately after he taught a class and they would reflect on what went right, what went wrong, 
and other questions designed to help the intern unpack his lesson. On one occasion Mike had tried 
to teach the nitrogen cycle to his honors biology class. Because of his biochemistry background, 
the nitrogen cycle was very easy for Mike to understand, however, when he tried to teach it he 
realized how difficult it was for the students. The following dialogue is from the feedback session 
following this lesson. 

Mike: It seemed to me it turned much more into the teacher saying see here you should have 
known this beforehand. To begin with it wasn ’t good teaching. It wasn ’t well done. 

My plan was to focus on the bigger ideas but I got derailed, I got lost in all the little 

details. 

Carol: I get lost in the nephron. I understand. 

Mike: Part of that has to be with my being a first year teacher but I do think there are elements 
of it’s far too much detail to keep up with here and if I get lost how can I expect the 
students to understand it? And then I was going to use the carbon cycle where we 
developed that overhead by thinking about how it relates to us and then go into 
phosphates but I felt like I was running out of time and so I asked them if this type of 
teaching was working for them and they said no. So I wanted to pick back up with the 
nitrogen cycle and make it less complex but because I hadn ’t planned for this it made it 
worse. I couldn ’t think how to make it more simple. 

Carol: Let’s try to think how we could simplify this. You mentioned before that you like to try 
visualization techniques. Do you think there is a visualization technique we could do 
with the nitrogen cycle that they could relate to more ? How could we model what they 
need to do to understand it? 

Mike: Well see that is interesting because when I think of the nitrogen cycle I have chemicals in 
my mind because once you know the chemicals and get them moving around in a cycle, 
there isn ’t much more to know. What I was trying to do was to give them particular 
terms that they need to know such as ammonification, nitrification, denitrification, and 
nitrogen fixation. 

Carol: Okay, going back to the original thing of how you think they can do it, especially 

chemistry. This is the first thing they hit that is like that. What kind of activity can we 
do that would model their actually walking through the cycle? 

Mike: We could have one group that is a plant, one group that is an animal, one group that is 
whatever, and the individuals are the bacteria. 

Carol: And then we could thread the nitrogen hooked to someone else. ..and have signs saying 
plant or whatever, because we talked to them about picturing biomes but they may have 
a hard time visualizing molecules. 

Mike: Oh they were so lost and I wasn ’t defining things properly. Part of that was I was 
thrown off because I was going to originally use the overhead for the carbon dioxide 
and have them use that as a clue to trigger ideas and develop it and I couldn ’tfind it. I 
still don’t know where it is. 

Carol: That happens to me too. In fact it is a good idea to have a plan B or think about 
several ways you can present it in case plan A doesn ’t work. 

Mike: No it is not in the text and there are too many lines on it. I mean there are too many 
things that are going on. 




755 778 



Carol: Perhaps we could get some yam or string and make some signs and have the 

nitrogen molecule go through and have the oxygen come in where it needs to come in 
and then have them move into the membrane but not worrying about the pluses and 
minuses. I have not done it that way but that is one way to do it. Usually / will get a 
simplified diagram and actually walk them through step by step, really, really slowly. 
The students were saying they were confused and they needed help. Sometimes I will 
ask them what they have done to understand to make sure they have done their part to 
understand. Then I try to pinpoint where exactly they are having the problem. Another 
technique / have used is for them to get a partner and try to work through it together, 
sort of teach it to each other. You may decide to use a simplified diagram. You may do 
some modeling or you may just want to walk them through without any extraneous 
stuff. Just walk them through the steps. There are a lot of different ways to do it. You 
might even name the molecules. I use to talk about Fred the water molecule. Anything 
to help them focus. One of your strengths is that because of your background, you 
understand it so well. But sometimes when something seems easy for us, it is difficult 
to think back and understand why some people don ’t understand it well. 

Carol continued to try to help Mike come up with a way to reteach the lesson. At first he was 
very resistant to reteaching it. He even said that he didn’t think that the biogeochemical cycles 
were important enough that they warranted further frustrating the students. Carol patiently 
explained how the cycles are building blocks for further learning. This eventually resulted in 
breakthrough learning for Mike when he began realizing the vast gap between his level of 
knowledge and the students level of understanding. 

Reflection is a crucial part of learning to teach. Mike needed to be able to ask questions such as 
why did you respond to Susan in that way? How did you decide to go on a tangent with David’s 
idea but not with Nancy’s? It was also important for Carol to unpack her thought processes and 
discuss important factors of teaching that Mike may have missed completely. 

Carol not only modeled reflective practice, but also served as a mirror to help Mike think 
about his own teaching. Carol served as a “guide at the side.” Mike pointed out that it was very 
helpful to have another pair of eyes to view the classroom through. Carol provided a lens through 
which Mike could gain another perspective of a complex and dynamic process. 

Mike also mentioned how helpful it was to reflect on the developmental levels of the students 
and to learn how to use this knowledge in planning for instruction. Mike and Carol incorporated 
the knowledge gained from this reflection time into their planning.

Co-Planner 



As a co-planner, the mentor acts as a tremendous resource by making available to the intern 
years of accumulated materials and insight into how to effectively use these materials. The mentor 
has effective “hooks” that catch students attention and get them excited about science. These ideas 
and materials can serve as springboards to beginning teachers who can use them as is, modify 
them, or create new materials inspired by the mentor’s resources. 

From the beginning of the semester Carol wanted Mike to be a partner in the planning. Carol 
had decided to begin the classes with a demonstration that she had seen at a workshop led by 
Stephen Covey. She encouraged Mike to add any ideas and he came up with an activity from camp 
that connected perfectly. 

Planning can be a daunting task for a beginning teacher. There are so many aspects to think 
about, i.e. learning styles, developmental levels, time factors, scope and sequence, state 
frameworks. National Science Standards. Carol consciously attempted to give rationales and 
explicit details of her thought processes during her planning. 

Carol: I to have the ecology unit pretty well mapped out by Friday. I will do the same for 

chemistry, biochemistry, cellular function, membrane function and we will continue to 
do it unit by unit. This will give you a framework of what I basically try to explore with 
the students. I would appreciate any comments or suggestions from you. You have just 
graduated from college and I am sure you are aware of the latest research, especially in 
your area of expertise. 

Mike: There is so much information. We surely can ’t cover it all. How do you select what is 
important? Can you give me an idea of what your class looks like? How deep do you 
go? How do you organize it into a cohesive whole? 

Carol: What I have found that works for me is to take big ideas such as interdependence, 

homeostasis, form fits function, chemical structures in terms of biological function, life 
takes place in solution, proteins are us... anything I teach fits under those ideas and 
that’s how the natural world works. What is the saying? Don ’t give them a fish. Teach 
them to fish. Therefore, they need to learn the natural laws that are in the world and 
they are dependent on that. To me if everyone would teach them this now then the next 
generation would stand up and say don ’t mess with clean air. Don ’t mess with clean 
water. Let’s all work together for solutions. This is all one planet. It is an enclosed 
system. You have to start with things that they can relate to immediately. That is why I 
start with ecology. It is something they understand. They can relate to it. It ties 
together everything else. Every unit I teach I keep coming back to the big ideas. It 
explains everything. I’m teaching the same thing every unit with different content. This 
also helps them to be very predictive because once they start catching on to the big ideas 
the students can predict how the next unit will relate to these ideas. Other components 
of my teaching are: I can learn from every student; I am interested in what they think; I 
expect questions; I expect questions I cannot answer (those are the most important 




757 



ones). Hopefully they come out of my class believing they can do it. They can do 

science. 

Mike: That gives me the big picture. How do you plan for the details? 

Carol: I take the state framework, the science standards, textbooks, course outlines and then I 
see how it all fits with the big themes. Then I start planning when I need to schedule 
certain units. I have to consider how different units build on each other. I have to 
consider the seasons, i.e. the plant unit is good to do in spring or fall. Other things I try 
to keep in mind are time factors. How much time do I need to cover a unit? What about 
holidays and breaks and what does that do to the student’ s frame of mind? In Advanced 
Placement Biology we have to consider when the test date is and what areas must be 
covered by then to prepare the students. Next I break it down by weeks and then by 
lessons. I don ’ t necessarily do the same thing each year. I am constantly looking for 
new ways of presenting things or new activities to try. There is so much to choose from 
and the best thing to do is to try things and keep a notebook of what works or doesn ’ t 
work and why it does or doesn ’t work. I want to help you make a notebook for each 
unit and I will give materials to you that I have used in the past. This will give you 
something to start with when you are planning for your classes next year. 

Once Mike took over teaching completely, he expressed how wonderful it was to have Carol to 
go to for ideas. He described her as “a tremendous resource. It is kind of like having free access 
to a candy store. There is so much to choose from.” 

In the beginning Carol and Mike always planned together. Mike would describe what he 
wanted to do and Carol would help him think it through. She would provide scenarios of how the 
students might react and then let him try to think of how he would respond. She sometimes would 
say, “/ don ’t think this will work. ” She would proceed to explain her reasoning behind this 
statement, but if he still wanted to attempt his idea she would give him room to try. Sometimes 
this resulted in success and other times failure but in either case they both were humble enough to 
leam from the experience. 

During one planning session near the beginning of the semester Mike wanted to place students 
in groups for an activity. Mike explained what he wanted to do and Carol very briefly suggested 
that he take the time to make his expectations of group work clear to the students. Mike chose not 
to take the time to do this and the following dialogue came from the next feedback and planning 
session. 

Mike: I started off the class with a short discussion and that worked out great but when I 
divided them up in groups it disintegrated. 

Carol: What did you want to happen in the groups? 

Mike: I wanted them to work together and all participate. I wanted them to realize that they 
have a lot to offer and that they don ’t have to be silly to get attention. 




758 



Carol: Do you think it is time to talk about group process? What do you expect from group 
work? Make this clear to them. Talk about everyone 's rights and responsibilities. I 
have a right and a responsibility to contribute. I do not have a right to ruin the group ’s 
focus or disrupt the group. There are basic rules for cooperative learning and we need 
to discuss this with them. 

Mike: I thought the assignment was clear and they would just know what to do. 

Carol: Tomorrow why don ’t you pull them back together and have them think how groups 
should work together. 

Mike: I really don ’t want to spend too much time on it. I think I will just say, “Yesterday there 
were some interesting interactions between the four different groups. You may want to 
think about it as a group how you want to work and what your goal is. ” But I don ’ t 
know that I would go further than that. And I guess my question is do I need to go 
further than that? Because I generally at all cost avoid any confrontation with students. 

Carol: Part of thinking through this is putting yourself in their place. The students come from 
all over the city . They come from vastly different backgrounds. Some of them have 
very strict traditional training and some of them have been exposed to more open-ended 
type of curriculum. Some of them have gotten by with doing very little because they 
were the brightest in their class. As ninth graders they are worried about grades but they 
are also concerned about connecting socially. Also because they come from such 
diverse backgrounds they have various perceptions of what group work is and if there 
hasn ’t been clear expectations either developed with the students or just given from the 
teacher or taken from a cooperative learning book, then they are coming with whatever 
their idea of group work is. So when you say you don ’t want to spend a lot of time on 
it .. . there is not some clear cut frame of reference that we are dealing with when we go 
to groups then we are talking about maybe 24 different frames of reference for group 

work. 

Mike struggled with the ideas of control and confrontation. He was totally against teacher 

centered classrooms, but his understanding of the alternative was not clear. It took many reflective 

conversations between Carol and Mike to help him come to an understanding of what “ teacher as 

facilitator " means. Later in the semester he made this statement, 

“I am learning that students need guidance and they need a framework to operate within. 
That is not teacher-centered. It is being a facilitator of the students learning. Students 
have incredible thoughts and ideas to share but as a facilitator I must come up with the 
activities and questions to prime their pumps and the parameters for them to operate 
within. ” 

Mike described his planning sessions with Carol in this way, 

“It has been truly phenomenal to work with Carol on planning lessons. She does much 
of this intuitively storing in her mind the discussions we have and recreating them 
during class. She is great at leading open discussions and she has themes ingrained in 
her mind, in part from her vast teaching experience, but also from having read so widely 
that she can access vast quantities of relevant stories and thoughts seemingly 
effortlessly. She writes little down. I would like to get to that point. ” 

At the beginning of the semester Carol was careful to include Mike in every aspect of teaching, 
however, at first it was clearly much more Carol’s input. As the semester progressed Mike began 




759 



to contribute more and more until he was doing the major part of the planning. They soon became 
a cohesive team and they could pass the teaching wand back and forth during a lesson without 
missing a beat. As co-teachers and co-leamers they developed a synergistic relationship. 
Co-Teacher 

Finally, when the mentor and intern teach together, the mentor acts as a co-teacher. The mentor 
and intern plan and teach as peers and then reflect on the lesson as co-leamers. Each person can 
contribute from their own strengths and the students get the best of both worlds. The synergy that 
develops from this partnering creates a fertile ground for construction of teaching knowledge by 
the intern. The mentor plays an important part in facilitating this growth. 

Getting to the point where both mentor and protege can work as peers requires successfully 

clearing many hurdles. The mentor must leam to trust the protege enough to let go of his or her 

class. Carol expressed this in the beginning when she said that she was nervous about letting go 

of her time with the students. Carol had a deep love for the students and she felt a strong 

responsibility for their growth in her class. She wanted them to have the best opportunities to 

leam. Mike also picked up on this and describes it in his journal: 

“Carol has tremendous energy and knowledge. / need to consider what to bring to the 
relationship for my strength is in my creativity and interaction with the students. How is 
it possible to give back all the knowledge and energy she is providing me? Once I know 
Carol better I will feel more relaxed at helping her teach the class. I am fully confident 
with the content but / can see that she is after much more than that for her students. ” 

About a week later Mike continues on this same subject, 

“I had an incredible conversation with Carol today. It was amazing the amount of trust 
that developed between us during this conversation. For the first time I internalized the 
fact that she loves these kids to the point of being fearful of someone else coming in and 
taking them from her. As any great teacher she is protective of her time for she has 
proven that she is effective. Any time from her is almost a gap of possibility. Having 
her begin to let go of her students will not be easy. ” 

Throughout the semester there were visible signs of progress on Mike’s journey to becoming a 

teacher. On one occasion Mike described one of these mile markers. 

“I had asked a rather far-reaching question and I realized it was not in the flow of where 
these students were. Having this type of realization and gaining the ability to step aside 
and leave the issue for another day was an exciting step for me. Even more, being able 
to pick up immediately with some other aspect of the subject without referring to my 
lesson plan means I am slowly acquiring a teacher’s sense of where ideas are going. ” 




760 



783 



Later Mike described further growth when he said, 



“/ feel that I am slowly gaining an ability to go off on tangents that the students bring up 
while still keeping in mind some of the analogies and links that I want to make with the 
material and what the students are considering. ” 

Not too far into the semester Mike and Carol began to truly team teach where either could take 
the lead on a moments notice . . . 

”1 was grading papers when Carol suddenly had to leave the room so I stepped in and 
picked right up with the students next comments. That was an exciting moment to 
completely trust the process and let the students lead me where they were going in the 
discussion. I can think on my feet! ” 

Mike is describing his transition from thinking like a student to thinking like a teacher. 

At the beginning of the semester Mike was almost overwhelmed by the magnitude of Carol’s 
personality and ability in teaching. He tried to imitate everything she did. Another sign of growth 
and confidence as a teacher was when he realized that he didn’t have to be Carol’s clone to be a 
good teacher. 

“Carol works well without very established plans, but rather a vision of where she is 
headed and how she works with kids. I realize I have been subordinating my own 
personal vision to that of Carol’s as she represents the mentor with experience. But that 
is not quite the way to proceed. Instead, Carol offers insight into how varying styles 
can still produce wonderful results. She simply can do things that I am not comfortable 
with, interacting with the kids through means that do not come naturally to me. She is 
more comfortable and loose around them. She offers her life as a somewhat open book. 
These elements work for her because they work in her personality. It is easy to see that 
she is confident. This builds the students’ trust. I however need a bit of distance. It 
has been good to slowly come to the conclusion that I do not need to be like her. She 
has a tremendous amount to offer, but I am not her nor can I be her. ” 

Carol had expressed concern that Mike was trying to mimic everything she did. She tried to 
help Mike follow his own instincts and develop his own style of teaching. She continually 
reminded Mike that there were many ways to do things and she tried to encourage him to follow 
his own ideas and take risks. As his confidence grew, he began to follow his instincts and to see 
how his teaching style was different than Carol’s but just as effective. 

Mike’s confidence grew, as did Carol’s belief in Mike until it reached the point that she could 
turn her classes over without reservation. Carol expressed this when she said, “7 just realized that 
I have completely turned over all the classes to Mike and I feel comfortable with doing that.” 




Co-Learner 



Mike and Carol became co-teachers but they were also co-leamers. In the beginning Mike was 
mainly the learner but as the mentor/protege relationship became established and trust was built, 
Mike began sharing ideas and bringing in articles and materials. Carol talked about this during a 
conversation I had with her. 

"At the beginning of the semester it was almost overwhelming the demands of putting 
100% into my classes and then pouring all that energy into encouraging and guiding 
Mike. At times I wasn 't sure if it was worth it or if it was making a difference but 
quickly that changed and Mike began to blossom. I began learning so much from Mike. 
He brings great ideas from his methods class at the university. Some of which I am 
sure I will use next year. It is difficult to stay abreast of the latest in science. I am an 
avid reader of Scientific American and other science journals but it has been great to 
have Mike contributing new articles and his knowledge from College. I know my 
students have benefited too from having someone with different strengths. I think we 
made a great team. Our teaching styles complemented each other and in a way our sum 
was greater than our parts. Another growth area for me was having to rethink my 
teaching. / am basically a very reflective person but I have had to ask why about a lot of 
things that I have done automatically for years. It has been great to have another adult in 
the classroom to share and bounce ideas off. I have been asked to write a textbook for 
Anatomy and Physiology incorporating some of the new ideas of mind and body 
wellness and it has been helpful to have Mike to provide insight into some of the 
activities I have tried this year. All in all I believe / have learned as much as he has. ” 

Mike described being a learner when he said, 

"It has been good to watch Carol teach. Her ability is tremendous for she reads people 
incredibly well. Further, she transforms the academic questions into personal inquiries. 
I have learned so much from her. I could never explain everything / have learned. 

Carol was a friend, an advocate, a challenger. She pushed me but also provided a 
cushion when I fell. Her guidance and encouragement were invaluable. Even though I 
taught a year before I came into this program, I have learned so much more this year. It 
seems that sharing a classroom with such an experienced teacher and being able to hear 
her think, bounce ideas off of her, and draw from her wealth of knowledge and 
resources has multiplied my learning opportunities and therefore my learning. ” 



Summary 

Gate keeper, model/guide, reflective practitioner, co-planner, co-teacher, and co-learner 
emerged as important functions through which Carol mentored Mike. In this study the mentor 
seemed to provide the assistance that served as a bridge to the intern. Instead of allowing the intern 
to sink or swim, she carefully and systematically facilitated his movement toward professional 
efficacy. From the beginning of the relationship Carol carefully assessed the level of Mike’s 




762 7 85 



development as a teacher and then delicately balanced the amount of “supporting” and “challenge” 
to ease his development of teacher expertise. 

Unlike many first year teachers who have little time to process and reflect on their teaching, 
Mike was able to share the responsibilities of a classroom with a seasoned veteran. This not only 
provided more time for contemplation, but also another more experienced point of view. Mike not 
only had his “novice” frame of reference to process and reflect on his teaching, he also had Carol’s 
“expert” perspective to help reframe his experiences. 

Mike summed up the benefit he experienced from having a mentor when he said, “It seems that 
sharing a classroom with such an experienced teacher and being able to hear her think, bounce 
ideas off of her, and draw from her wealth of knowledge and resources has multiplied my learning 
opportunities and therefore my learning.” Instead of questioning whether he wanted to stay in 
teaching, Mike ended the semester looking forward to having his own classroom where he would 
continue his journey of learning to teach. 

Conclusions and Implications 

The use of a mentor is one answer to the problem of providing support for beginning teachers. 
Instead of isolation, survival, and trial and error learning, mentors offer novice teachers 
companionship, guidance, and opportunities for reflection which may ease the transition from 
student of teaching to teacher. For this to occur the experienced teacher must be willing to open 
doors, model teaching expertise, facilitate development, provide opportunities for reflection and 
collaboratively plan, teach and learn with their mentee. Fulfillment of the role of mentor requires 
an incredible amount of time and mental energy. There are many dilemmas for a novice entering a 
world of experts; therefore, it appears the mentor needs to be acutely aware of the intern’s needs 
and act in a manner that promotes personal and professional growth. For a novice teacher who has 
a need to be accepted, valued, and heard on a personal and professional basis, it appears that 
mentors’ investments of time and mental energy are invaluable. 

Case studies of mentor/protege relationships provide a lens into the world of learning to 
teach. They provide insights into how we can and cannot facilitate this process. These case 



studies also provide a glimpse into the minds’ of novice teachers allowing researchers/practitioners 
to see from the perspective of a beginning teacher. This information can be used to design more 
effective ways to increase positive learning experiences for beginning teachers. 

More case studies of both negative and positive mentoring experiences need to be available for 
both prospective mentors and proteges to read. The effect of this might be three-fold: 1) Teachers 
that are already mentors could learn from other mentor’s experiences; 2) Prospective mentors 
would become aware of the tremendous amount of time and energy required to be a mentor; 

3) Beginning teachers would become more aware of their role as proteges and how they can best 
ease the mentoring process. 

Finally, case studies can be used by administrators to learn more about the characteristics 
needed to be an effective mentor. Much of the past research is from broad studies that looked at a 
large number of mentors. Case studies paint vivid pictures of mentors who have learned to 
facilitate the growth of beginning teachers. 

I close with a quote from Daloz (1986), which summarizes Mike and Carol’s relationship and 

reiterates the ability of mentors to empower their mentees: 

For each of us tangled inside our own stories, the endings are hidden. Yet most of us 
spend the better part of our lives trying to assure ourselves that our tales are already told, 
even if not yet lived, and that they have a happy ending. The discovery that this might 
not be so can, in itself, lead to a profound transformation. But the appearance of 
someone who has already taken the journey can bring a sigh of relief to the best of us. 
That is where mentors come in. They have been there before, and we greet them with 
awe, and above all hope. (p. 27) 

Carol provided a vision of the possible for Mike. She assisted him in his development as a 
teacher. Mike in return provided additional opportunities for Carol to reflect on her development as 
a teacher. Both were changed through this mentoring relationship and time will only tell the affect 
of this change on their future students and society.

A CASE STUDY OF ALTERNATIVE ASSESSMENT: STUDENT, 
TEACHER, AND OBSERVER PERCEPTIONS IN A NINTH GRADE 
BIOLOGY CLASSROOM 

Peter D. Veronesi, State University of New York at Brockport 



Overview 

This single-site phenomenological case study at Suburban High School examined the 
perceptions of one teacher (Len) as well as his students, colleagues, and principal toward 
alternative assessment strategies and associated phenomena in Len's ninth grade biology 
classroom. Researcher perceptions are also included. Although there are multiple participants, 
the primary focus of this research was to understand and make sense of the world in which Len 
existed and where he viewed what he considered more meaningful assessment activities as 
alternative assessments. 

The research methodology employed for this report was a qualitative descriptive case 
study using a phenomenological perspective, which describes the world experienced by the 
participants in their own terms. Questions guiding this study sought to determine: 1) what 
happened in Len's biology classroom as he used alternative assessment? 2) Len's perceptions 
toward alternative assessments and his rationale for using them; 3) how his students viewed his 
assessment strategies and the associated phenomena they experienced; 4) what students 
perceived as primary determinants of their grade; and 5) what Len's immediate science faculty 
colleague's and principal's perceptions were toward alternative assessment. 

This study intended to contribute to the understanding of alternative assessment 
implementation by providing detailed, in-depth analysis of how Len, a 30 year veteran biology 
teacher, implemented and perceived assessment. Data reduced from interview transcripts, 
observations, and documents resulted in thematic perception generalizations of Len and the other 
participants toward alternative assessment at Suburban High School. Since it was the students 
who were being assessed, their thoughts and perceptions toward alternative assessment and their 
grades were also documented. After all, it could be argued that students' feelings and attitudes 




767 

790 



directly impact the success or failure of alternative assessment implementation. Similarly, since 
it was presumed that Len had significant contact and responsibilities with others in his school, 
there was also a need to discuss alternative assessment philosophies with his science teacher 
colleagues and the principal. 

Analysis of the data was not intended to support or refute claims made in the name of 
alternative assessment. Rather, this study was intended to provide a vivid description of the 
situation studied and delineate potential implications for using alternative science assessment in a 
lasting and meaningful way. The following generalizations were supported by the data and those 
directly connected to Len were each redefined by him: 

Case Generalizations: 

1. Len's goals for, and perceived responsibilities toward, his students played an important 
role in his implementation of what he considered alternative assessment. 

2. While Len used a variety of alternative assessment strategies, he still used the multiple- 
choice test format with essays as the primary source for individual student accountability. 

3. Len's early and on-going informal assessments of students' abilities and attitudes played a 
key role in his perceptions of any individual's work ethic. 

4. Len's involvement with professional development experiences had a direct impact on 
what assessments were used in his classroom. 

5. Positive role models during the first few years of Len's career had a very strong impact on 
his perception of teaching; ultimately influencing what assessments he used from year to 
year. 

6. "A work in progress:" Len's constantly evolving and continuing vision of his assessment 
future, coupled with his reflection on the level of his student's on-task engagement, 
fostered his acceptance and ultimate level of use of alternative assessment. 

7. Arriving early to school, staying late after school, working weekends, expending large 
amounts of physical energy, and possessing other qualities of an exemplary teacher, 
facilitated Len's use of alternative assessments within his standard 50 minute period. 



8. Len felt confident, yet alone and humble among his colleagues regarding his use of 
alternative assessments. Len felt he was a "Lone Ranger" regarding alternative 
assessment. 

9. Len had philosophical visions of alternative assessment use and the role it played in the 
life of a teacher, "In the ideal world". 

10. Past experiences of Len's students affected their current perceptions of assessment reality 
in his class. 

11. Students worked toward learning goals only if an extrinsic reward existed; either in the 
form of points or grades. 

12. Students felt they did best when they: worked in cooperative groups, took fewer tests, did 
projects, were active in class, and experienced less teacher talk. 

13. Ninth grade students were more comfortable when the teacher evaluated them than 
themselves or each other. 

14. Len's colleagues perceived alternative assessments as requiring too much time for the 
number of students they were responsible for. 

15. Len's principal had only limited knowledge about alternative science assessment but felt 
her science teachers were "moving in the right direction." 

Introduction 

"There is, I think, some mysterious unseen hand that shapes the consensus in 
American education. Almost overnight, assessment has become the focal 
point of a great debate about the purpose, shape, and control of American 
education." 

Marc S. Tucker (1991) 

Berlak (1992) argued for authentic academic achievement from students that challenges 

the narrow view of academic learning represented in almost all standardized multiple choice tests 

today. Some teachers have always sought to assess their students by creative, authentic means 

within the confines of the classroom. But, much assessment during the past decade has strayed 



far from what many would consider authentic measures of true student learning (Berlak, 1992; 
National Academy of Science and The National Committee on Science Education Standards and 
Assessment , 1996; Stiggins, 1991 a, b, c; Wiggins, 1993 a, b, c). 

The purpose of this research was to describe the nature and implications of alternative 
assessment strategies used in a biology classroom by one ninth grade teacher. As a result, this 
study describes the ways alternative science assessments were perceived and used by this teacher 
(whose pseudonym will be Len), perceptions of his role in assessment use, perceptions held by 
his students, colleagues, and principal toward alternative assessment, and perceptions of the 
researcher. 

This phenomenological, single-case study examined a ninth grade biology classroom 
within its complex, cultural setting. The study was prompted by the National Science Education 
Standards (1996) and the enormous number of calls for the use of alternative assessments in 
science classrooms (Archbald & Newmann, 1988, 1991; Berlak, 1992; National Academy of 
Science and The National Committee on Science Education Standards and Assessment , 1996; 
Newmann, Secada, and Wehlage, 1995; Rutherford & Ahlgren, 1990; Stiggins, 1991 b; Wiggins, 
1993 a, b, c.). 

Alternative Assessment: A Definition 

Most definitions of alternative assessment have similar notions that require a movement 
away from multiple-choice or standardized tests and a movement toward learner-centered 
assessment that relies on student generated responses (Wiggins, 1993 a). Alternative assessment 
1) includes alternatives to standardized or traditional tests for finding out what a student knows 
or can do; 2) is intended to show growth and inform instruction; 3) is criterion-referenced, not 
norm -referenced test (it compares performance against established criteria or standards, not 
against a peer population; 4) is authentic when it is based on activities that represent actual 
progress toward a broad range of instructional goals (not just cognition) and reflects tasks typical 
of classrooms and real-life settings; and 5) may include teacher observation, performance-based 
assessment, and student self-assessment (Pierce & O'Malley, 1992).

The Current State of Science Assessment 



Most science teachers at this time still continue to use some form of multiple choice test 
to assess and evaluate students (Stiggins, 1991c). To counter an over-use of traditional 
assessments. The National Commission on Testing and Public Policy (1990) recommended that 
testing programs currently relying too heavily on multiple-choice tests should begin a movement 
toward more alternative forms of assessment. More recently. The National Science Education 
Standards (1996) reform also suggested the need for alternative assessment methods. 

Alternative assessments are likely to be more authentic or real in nature than traditional 



assessments, and therefore, be more closely aligned with the true goals that teachers have for 
their students' learning. The primary rationale for an increased use of alternative forms of 
assessment is that they are thought better at providing teachers and administrators with a more 
complete picture of what each student might know and understand about a science related skill or 
concept rather than comparing the knowledge of individuals to a standardized norm. Alternative 
assessments also are intended to help students begin to self-assess and take responsibility for 
their learning (Haury, 1993; Mitchell, 1992; Stiggins, 1991 b; Vandervoort, 1983; Wiggins, 

1989, 1992, 1993 b & d). 

What is lacking, however, are reports using any acceptable research methods that 
measure or detail the impact of such alternative assessments (Jorgensen, 1993). 



Current reform movements in science education now make assessment a major issue 
(Jorgensen, 1993; National Academy of Science and The National Committee on Science 
Education Standards and Assessment , 1996; Tucker, 1991). Central to this issue is the 
movement toward higher order questions that provide a much greater portion of what a student 
might know and understand than has been the case in recent years. According to the National 
Science Education Standards (1996), students should be involved with exercises that closely 
approximate all the intended outcomes of science education. These alternative assessments

require students to apply scientific information and reasoning to situations like those they will 
encounter in the real world or that approximate how scientists do their work. The assessment 
tasks should be similar in form to tasks they will engage in during their lives outside the 
classroom. 

All alternative assessments are aimed at higher level thinking that requires more than rote 
memorization. Authors have used various forms of logical reasoning as they address the need for 
alternative assessment. Rationales such as constructivism, obtaining student generated 
responses, thinking of learners as individuals, and linking assessment to instruction have been 
used to support the use of alternative assessments (Darling-Hammond, Einbender, Frelow, and 
Ley-King, 1993; Glazer & Ogle, 1994; Haury, 1993; Herman, 1992; Jorgensen, 1993; Linn, 1994 
a &b; Raizen et al, 1990; Sheppard, 1989 & 1994; Stiggins, 1992; The National Academy of 
Science and The National Committee on Science Education Standards and Assessment , 1996; 
Wiggins, 1989). Many examples of alternative assessment have indeed been documented (Dana 
et al, 1991; Darling-Hammond et al, 1993; Glazer & Ogle, 1994). But, amid the stories that 
detail the use of alternative assessment in science classrooms, surprisingly little can be found in 
the literature regarding the effects, impact, or implications of using alternative assessments. The 
research literature prior to this study similarly offered precious little in the way of describing the 
perceptions of teachers and students toward alternative assessments. Only one study was located 
that dealt with assessment in a high school biology class (Stiggins, 1986). A few reports were 
located that covered alternative assessments in elementary and college situations and those 
focused specifically on performance assessments or portfolio assessments as methods in 
particular rather than their impact on teachers or students (Anderson, 1993; Darling-Hammond, 
1995; Reid et al, 1992; Sheppard, 1995). No reports were found with a phenomenological, 
conceptual framework as was the central focus of this research. In short, there is simply a 
research void in this area (Herman & Winters, 1994; Jorgensen, 1993).

Rationale for Research Methodology 



Descriptions of Len's classroom rationale for using alternative assessment were based on 
qualitative, naturalistic research methodology. Specifically, phenomenological methods were 
followed as closely as possible so that any stated descriptions would closely mirror those of the 
participants rather than an outside observer; i.e. the researcher. Describing the classroom 
situation using the same terms as the participants provides their perceptions from the way they 
would describe it to others (McGee-Brown, 1994). 

Qualitative research which has a phenomenological focus provides a very thick (Geertz, 
1973), rich, and detailed description; one that originates from the participants. This type of study 
can be viewed as "purposive" as described by Chein (1981) or as "purposeful" by Patton (1980). 
Merriam (1988) further describes purposive sampling as being a way to discover and understand 
phenomena from a source known to provide the best possible information. Len was chosen for 
this study because it was felt that he fit the requirements for a purposive sample. Over a one year 
period, Len was identified as a teacher who was attempting to use a variety of alternative 
assessments. 

A single site was chosen because it afforded an excellent opportunity to discover 
phenomena within the real world settings in which they occurred (Merriam, 1988). The principal 
goal of this study was to describe the perceptions of a teacher who uses alternative science 
assessments, his actions, the artifacts, documents, or tools he uses, thoughts of the other 
participants, and the description of the culture in which the assessments were used. Len, his 
students, colleagues, and principal were part of this cultural system and were considered as 
determinants for any actions that took place within the school. 

A second goal was to begin with a predetermined set of questions related to alternative 
science assessment. As evolving working hypotheses emerged (Merriam, 1988), new questions 
were asked based on what the observations, data, and inferences suggested. As naturalistic 
research continues, it is not uncommon to change direction and ask new questions (McGee- 





773 



Brown, 1994; Merriam, 1988). It would be naive to assume all possible questions could be asked 
at the outset because of the constantly evolving system that occurs in any school. 

Research Questions 

The questions that follow guided this research from the outset and were used as a base for 
collecting the most relevant forms of data: 

1. What happened in Len's biology classroom when alternative assessments were used? 

2. What were Len's perceptions of alternative assessment and his rationale for using them? 

3. How did students view the alternative assessment strategies they experienced? 

4. What did students think determined their grades? 

5. What were the perceptions of Len's colleagues and principal toward assessment? 

The Setting and Participants 

A Description of Suburban High School and its General Culture 
The setting in which this study took place was Suburban High School (pseudonym); a 
grade 9-12 building located in the suburbs of a very large, midwestem metropolitan area with a 
human population numbering in the millions. Looking at Suburban High School from one of the 
four, 20 acre parking lots, one sees an attractive, three-floored, well maintained, and immense 
structure. 

Most observations at Suburban High School were conducted within Len's classroom. The 
physical components and layout of Len's room changed only imperceptibly throughout the 
duration of the study. Len's classroom, which he shared with two other teachers each day, is 
approximately 40 feet wide and 25 feet from front to back. Student desks were always arranged 
in four rows of seven, unless an activity required their movement. 

The key participants in this study were Len, his 56 ninth grade students in two BioCom 
classes, two chemistry teachers, one earth science teacher, one physics teacher, two biology 
teachers, and the principal. Although a small sample limited any possibility for generalizability, 
this case study research dug deeper and looked more broadly than would be conceivable with 
some commonly used quantitative methods.

I Overview of Study 

This study consisted of Phase I and Phase II ; the phases were separated by over two 
months. Phase I observations of the two BioCom classes occurred on two or three consecutive 
days per week for nine weeks during the first grading quarter of the Suburban High School year, 
September 15, 1995 to November 3, 1995. Monday and Friday visits were avoided to reduce the 
effects of anxieties on Len and his students that may have existed on these days. The length of 
each classroom observation for Phase I and II was 50 minutes as well as before and after class 
time. The two BioCom classes occurred in the afternoon in consecutive order. The seventh hour 
class met from 1:40 to 2:30 P.M. ; the eighth hour class met from 2:35 to 3:25 P.M. As field 
observations were made, documents such as tests, mind maps, BioLogs (student logs/reflective 
notebooks), posters, video tapes of student presentations, and other forms of assessment that Len 
used were simultaneously collected as documents for analysis. Phase II consisted on revisiting 
the setting for two consecutive weeks in February 1996 to conduct more intensive interviews 



with students, make further observations, collect assessment artifacts, and clarify research 
findings with Len. 

Data Collection and Analysis Techniques 

Data for this research consisted of the following: 1) field notes; i.e. observations within 
and around Suburban High School; 2) in-depth, informal, e-mail communications and oral 
interviews with Len, 15 individual and six group interviews with students, and individual 
interviews with six of Len's colleagues and the principal that were all tape recorded and later 
transcribed for coding and analysis; 3) collection of documents and artifacts (McGee-Brown 
1994; Merriam, 1988; Adler & Adler, 1994; Stake, 1994. 

Data analysis was a very time consuming and complex process, which included making 
sense of interview transcripts, observations, and documents. All data sources required reading 
and re-reading between five and ten times in order to develop the clearest pictures of the 
condition in this school (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). Interview transcripts, observations, and 
documents were analyzed using the constant comparative method as outlined by Glaser and 
Strauss (1967) and naturalistic inquiry as suggested by Lincoln and Guba (1985). 

Emergent, generalized statements from the findings were discussed with Len for 
verification and validation; a component of phenomenological research called member checking 
to see if the analysis was indeed in his own words (Merriam, 1988). Obtaining member checks 
maintains trustworthiness in a study. Upon receipt of the member checks from Len, the process 
of re-categorization continued (Lincoln & Guba, 1985; McGee-Brown, 1994; Stake, 1994). 

Constant attempts were made to search for alternative explanations to any data analysis 
that began providing any theories. Because observations, statements, or similar pieces of data 
may be interpreted in different ways, it was the responsibility of the researcher to provide the 
most plausible explanation for any analyzed data (Marshall & Rossman, 1989; McGee-Brown, 
1994). Triangulation was achieved by using all the various sources of data, member checks, and 
the expertise of the researcher as an instrument model (Merriam, 1988). 




776 



Discussion of the Findings 



"Qualitative researchers seem particularly vulnerable to the tendency- and urge- to go 
beyond reporting WHAT IS and to use their studies as platforms for making 
pronouncements of WHAT OUGHT TO BE. A critical divide separates the realm of the 
observable from the realm of values about good and bad." 



H. F. Wolcott (1990) 

There is no absolute process or method in conducting qualitative research. Likewise, 
reporting findings in a qualitative study must be done in such a way as to remain true to the 
situation under observation and to express terms so that they relate mainly to that culture. This 
may be done in many slightly different methods because authorities in the field of qualitative 
research differ in subtle ways as to specific procedures for the processes in a qualitative study 
(Merriam, 1988; Altheide & Johnson, 1994). As suggested, data for analysis were collected 
within a specified number and types of cultural contexts, which is important for correct data 
interpretation (McGee-Brown, 1994). 



Len’s Story of His Alternative Assessment Practices 

The following sections each tell a story from the perspectives of Len, his students, and 
his colleagues. Each section also contains some interpretations of the researcher, linking 
evidence from interviews, observations, and documents. Although Len's goals and thoughts are 
discussed somewhat separately, they should be considered as occurring simultaneously and in 
varying amounts within his classroom practices and setting. Each selected quote or description 
dealing with the study begins with a researcher assertion followed by a member check validation 
or refutation by Len. 



1. Len's goals for his students played an important role in the 
implementation of what he considered alternative assessment. 

Len's member check: 

"Yes, I agree! Goals at a couple of levels a) at a thinking skills 
level ( critical thinking, organization, communication), and b) at 
an attitude level that they will see science as a dynamic, creative, 
and 'fun' process. "

Interviews with Len and observations of his class indicated that what he "wanted for his 
kids" had a direct impact on what occurred in the classroom including what assessments he used. 
His goals were either implied or specifically stated during interviews. In addition, since Len 
defined alternative assessment as "more the activities [he] used in class", observations focused on 
his instruction rather than how the literature might have defined alternative assessment. 

Len had at least 12 stated or implied goals for his students, which included: 1) student 
self-assessment/evaluation, 2) writing and reflecting in their BioLogs, 3) striving for quality in all 
work they did; 4) organizing information and presenting to class; 5) working hard; 6) students 
should respect and follow his directions; 7) students should enjoy his class; 8) group work; 9) 
creativity; 10) lessened focus on content; 11) creation of nurturing/warm environment, and 12) 
critical thinking. 

Len's overriding reasons for using assessments of any kind were to 1) "get kids engaged;" 
2) "to know the assessment is going to be a benefit to his kids;" and 3) "bring me new 
information about his kids that I didn't have before." These reasons led Len to mention a number 
of times that he often had done "the hottest thing at the time." With this comment, he was 
referring to what was being presented at conferences and workshops and what was being 
discussed in the literature. Regardless of the hottest thing, Len did not use these suggested ideas 
with his students unless they met his three overriding criteria. 

Len's most important goal for his students were their self-assessments (he also called 
them self-reflections and his students mostly called them self-evaluations), "I want them to see 
what they've learned." Len was very interested in having them look at what they knew and 
understood. If they did not, he felt that he tried practical methods to get the students to a point 
where they could understand. Some of the practical methods of student self-evaluation were 
integral to BioCom where they were called "self-checks." 

Len was also interested in "encouraging [students] to think about what they understood" 
and he "used the self-checks so the students could develop a strategy for filling in the gaps [of 
their knowledge]." Len similarly felt, "it was important for [students] to see and understand what

778 



they did not know, so they could do something about it." Although Len wanted students to 
understand their level of knowing, few students were able to articulate a strong understanding of 
this goal. 

Student self-evaluation or assessment was also recorded in their BioLogs. The BioLog 
was one of Len's key alternative assessment strategies and was intended to contain the student 
self-reflections. Student self-reflections provided Len a window into their thoughts; helping him 
to realize his goal of student self-evaluation. He stated, "The log assessment has been the most 
effective strategy for meeting [my goal of student self reflection]. In having kids keep track of 
things, writing with some thought and keeping a good notebook, this [ BioLog ] has really 
extended beyond where notebooks used to be." 

As Len's view of the student log evolved and grew, his belief in the power it had in 
helping kids better understand biology and his conviction to its constant use also grew: 

I have always been convinced that the notebook/log/joumal thing is a really important 
tool. I always focused on the notes in the past; just the simple taking of notes. With the 
Quality Schools effort and the reflective writing that came with it, I [bought into it] and 
that's one thing I do differently now. I also assess on more than just 'I've got something 
written down for a day, and it's all neat, pretty, and well organized,' although [those 
things] are part of it. 



2. Despite using a variety of assessment strategies, Len still 
considered the multiple choice test and essay die primary source 
for individual students accountability.

the 'total' student picture . " 

On one occasion during the first grading quarter, Len passed out a 55 point test on 
Biodiversity, which was the BioCom unit they were studying at the time. The test was 
distributed after 7 minutes of teacher talk and students were given the remainder of the 50 minute 
period to complete it. Len described the 43 minute duration of this test as: "I guess it's pretty 
much a standard thing, given the amount of information they've worked with." No other 
rationale for test length was given. While these kinds of tests provided Len individual

accountability, it was later discovered that this test, and those like it, caused a great deal of fear 
or anxiety in all but one or two students. 

Len indicated that between 1965 and 1975 he was generally pretty traditional. He 
lectured on a regular basis, followed the text closely, and relied heavily on test and quiz grades. 
While the traditional test was still evident, Len indicated his use of these period-long tests had 
declined over the years. Even though he felt his multiple-choice test with essay the number one 
way of having students produce what they know about biological content knowledge, he was 
confident his reliance on them had lessened. 

Len's rationale for his continued use of traditional tests came from his current educational 
responsibilities. He simply could not imagine "a better, more efficient way to obtain student 
accountability" than his test provided: 



I can't even imagine doing 28 individual projects [alternative assessments], truthfully! 

The multiple choice format is the only way [to get the accountability I want] at this stage 
of the game. If I did the projects. I'd be grading until I retired! 

He continued: "only multiple choice tests give me what I consider individual 
accountability for biology." The actual test was scored using the heavily-used scantron machine 
in the science office. Len felt this kind of assessment provided the quickly-needed feedback for 
both him and his students regarding their content knowledge of biology. 

Len could think of no other assessments that could accomplish what he felt important in 
this regard, individual accountability: "I still think there comes a time where each kid has to be 
accountable for what they've learned; a test does this for me." He concluded that there was also a 
"sanity factory [associated] with giving this kind of test." 

Len's Grade Book 

Throughout interviews, Len was asked questions about the processes he had gone through 
over the past 30 years and changes that had occurred in his grading practices. Indeed, Len's 
grade book closely matched what he described during interviews. During one conversation 
regarding the change in his grading practices, he provided a direct window into his assessments. 
He stated that 20 years ago his grade book would have reflected a much greater reliance on test

scores for student grades. Although he was not able to produce an actual copy of the grade book 
from past years, his description indicated that his current grade book relies on test scores about 
1/3 as much as it did in the past

Each of the assessments in the grade book was labeled as alternative or traditional by the 
researcher. These labels were then sent to Len for a member check to obtain his view. The 
comparisons between the researcher and Len were very similar and listed above. 



3. Len's perceived role and responsibility as a teacher had an 
impact on what forms of assessment he used. 

member check: 

"Yes!" 

Len was a biology teacher who felt strongly that students should understand nature and 
the problems that were occurring in the natural environment. At the same time, he knew he was 
dealing with kids and was constantly trying to find ways to help them learn: 



If I can get [students] to open up their horizons as to what goes into more meaningful 
learning, to get them to recognize that what we are trying to get them to learn has some 
meaning in their real life, and they can have input into decisions that affect their learning, 
and the assessment of their learning, I think victory can be declared! 




781 



Len felt it was his responsibility to provide experiences for his students so they would 
enjoy science. He thought by creating a friendly, warm classroom environment, he could help 
students become more open and communicate to each other more effectively. 

Len also felt the need to show his students the criteria they generated mattered. Feeling 
the responsibility of getting students to develop their own criteria for projects fit his goals, he 
stated: "My motivation was to be fairer to kids. I would like them to feel that they are actually 
using what they came up with themselves." His role in this process was a provider of class time 
to let students develop the criteria. He thought that if he did not provide this time for the activity 
of students generating their own criteria, "it would go back to the same old thing of the teacher 
giving them what they need and what [the students] think is not important." While Len had 
students creating their own criteria, he felt it was "the instructor's responsibility to monitor the 
criteria they set so they don't make them unrealistically too high or low." 

Len's perceived responsibility for having students produce quality fit with his interest in 
having students be accountable for themselves. Since Len was unsure of his student's previous 
personal accountability from other teachers, he was set on "having the buck stop here!" He felt 
that having students begin to think about quality was in their best interest. 

Len also felt one of his roles was to keep "order and control" of his classroom so that a 
focus on the topic at hand could occur. 

I'm kind of an order person. I'm also better now than I was 20 years ago at dealing with 
voice. I do have a problem with class if I'm talking and I don't have their full attention. I 
get distracted by it. In a group setting, I need to have their focus. Now, when they're 
doing lab work, it doesn't bother me. 

Len's perceived need to "bring the students through the curriculum" in a situation where 
he felt there "was volume learning going on" created the various roles that he realized in his 
class. He felt his role was to "plant seeds" because "his professional judgment told him what was 
best for his students." Finally, his need for student accountability evolved from a feeling that 
"unless someone takes a stand and demanded personal accountability it would never happen." 

His role, in part, was to make it so. 




782 



4. Len's early and on-going informal assessments of students' 
abilities played a key role in his perceptions of any individual work 
ethic and content understanding. 

member check: 

"Yes.” 

Len actively tried to make his class a warm, inviting place for students by his initial 
homework, in-class tasks, assessments, and assignments. They were structured to ease students 
into his class. While students were engaged in these tasks and participating in class, Len felt 
comfortable saying, "I know early on who does work and who doesn't." When asked again in 
Phase II about his belief in informal assessment of students, he remarked: "Patterns for students 
usually hold from early on in the year." Len felt comfortable in discussing the work ethic of any 
of his students and knew comfortably those students who worked and those who did not. Having 
students attain a good work ethic was also one of Len's goals. 

While assessing students in an informal manner, Len looked for similar effort that he had 
experienced in life: "I guess I've always felt like I had to work hard, and I find it somewhat 
objectionable if a kid has got all this talent and won't work or does poor work." He looked for 
thinking and questioning skills, determined mostly during his large group discussions. Len also 
looked at students who needed help from him, keying into the problems any single student might 
face. 

Len was convinced that daily student responses to his questions during his large group 
discussions told him the most about who was "getting it and who was not." While he felt this 
informal assessment was effective for him, he could not justify putting the information into a 
grade book or keeping notes on individual students. Even though Len felt he was gaining insight 
into all his students through discussion over an extended period of time, rarely did more than 6 to 
10 students out of 28 respond on any given day. In fact, observations indicated that the majority 
of students rarely spoke at all. Despite this discrepancy in numbers, Len said: 

I really try to get my questions spread out some and contact 6 or 8 [students each day]. I 
feel like over the course of 3 days, I feel like I have a pretty good clue of where they are. 




783 



There were a few instances where Len was frustrated because his informal assessment of 
students did not match their real understanding, causing him dismay. One example occurred 
when students were given an assignment to "find an article illustrating how the loss of 
biodiversity caused or led to another event." After some discussion of biodiversity and the 
assignment Len responded in this way: 

Y ou would think that 1 was speaking Kurdish or something! When we went to the 
library on Friday, 1 explained the task again. The questions [from students] started: '1 
have this article that shows how CFC's affected the ozone layer. Is this okay?' or '1 found 
an article that explains what biodiversity is all about!' 1 couldn't believe it! The whining 
became deafening! 

Len was dealing with 27 to 28 students in each hour. One of his goals during the first 
few weeks of school was "to get a feel for where the kids [were]". He felt his "intuitive feelings" 
provided him with proper feedback. He also spent time "watching and listening" to "the ideas 
and questions of students in groups." He was very attentive during these times and assessed the 
comfort levels of individuals and kept track of students in his memory. 

Len's informal assessment of students was also tied to his responsibility to get students 
involved and engaged. He felt observing the students informally provided him with sufficient 
information to help them become more engaged than they may have been otherwise. Some of 
Len's students also felt that his informal observations had a direct impact on their achievement. 
One student commented: 

"[He looks for] your performance, your attention level, just how you act in class. [Len] 
sees someone really trying hard to understand something, coming in extra to get help. 

So, he might grade better on that kind of behavioral thing." 

Other students stated independently: 

"He looks at our attitude in class, how we are at answering questions." 

"How much attention you pay him in class." 

"How we work together, if you're not goofing off. That looks good to him." 

Although both Len and his students felt informal assessment was integral to the 
classroom environment, Len also admitted he could never really be sure of what was going on 



O

inside "a kid's head." Len did, however, feel certain about one matter "By the time I have a kid 
in biology class for the year, I have a pretty good idea about that kid." Len felt "the patterns [of 
kids] really do hold," which was his rationale for not giving difficult tasks early on. Easier 
assignments early in the year provided Len with mental pictures of many of his students so that 
he was able to see who he might need to be concerned about. 

5. Len's involvement with professional development experiences 
had a direct impact on what assessments were used in his 
classroom. 

member check: 

”YesW" 

It was not difficult to understand how Len's professional involvement and affiliation 
aided in his use and adaptation of alternative assessment. Not only was Len involved with 
BioCom, a new curriculum containing alternative assessment, but he had also presented his 
methods of alternative assessment at the NABT conference during this study. 

The two most important factors that emerged from Len's professional involvement were 
his recent awareness of cooperative learning strategies and his constant quest to find engaging 
activities for his students, which resulted in his increase use of alternative assessment: 



From 1985 to 1995 1 became involved with cooperative learning strategies and had 
students begin to play a role in assessment [of self, and of others]. I learned strategies to 
make group work more effective and students individually accountable as well. I think 
this was the birth in my brain of authentic assessment strategies. We also became aware 
of Dr. William Glasser's Quality School, and again this helped to refine strategies for 
students to begin to look at what THEY wanted, what THEY were doing to get it. I also 
took some course work on motivation, developing student responsibility, questioning 
strategies and attended several critical thinking conferences. These all helped to form my 
teaching style. STS biology became a buzzword and that rang the bell for me in that I was 
on the mark in making those links between course work and real world science. It verified 
that the thought processes were far more essential than the content. 

Len went from merely attending presentations at conferences to presenting at them 
himself, enjoying it immensely. He felt the most important change for him came in 1984 while 
he was attending a genetics workshop at a major midwestem university: 




785 



What I found out was what I was doing very much in tune with those people who were 
getting the recognition, or being recognized as being outstanding teachers. I went Oh! 

You mean I'm not so far off base? That's really where the biggest growth and biggest 
jump in willingness to try to pursue things like [these different assessment ideas] started 
to happen. 

Len's knowledge of new assessment trends did not always guarantee they would be used 
with his students. He stated, "There are a lot of things teachers have to do and [I] always get tom 
between doing what's easiest and doing what the current trend is or what the right thing to do is." 



6. Positive role models during the first few years of Len's career 
had a very strong impact on his perception of teaching; ultimately 
influencing what assessments he used from year to year. 

member check: 

"Positive role models during the first few years of Len's career had 
a very strong impact on his perception of teaching. This ultimately 
influenced his views on using a variety of assessment. This feels 
more accurate to me . " 

As Len discussed his views on teaching, learning, and assessment, he would make 
reference to the mentors he had during his first few years of teaching. Len's two role models, 
Mr. West and Mr. Mouvers, exerted a strong influence over him. Mr. Mouvers was especially 
significant to Len: 

Mr. Mouvers was the guy I looked to as being somebody I would strive to be like! He 
was always trying to bring the real world into the classroom. He and Mr. West started a 
class called 'Social Implications of Biology' years before STS became a buzzword. 

Len commented that his start with these two individuals. He emphasized how each was able to 
get him thinking along the lines of STS. 

Len's two role models had transferred to other schools early in his career. This fact did 
not deter him from developing a team-teaching approach to science with the social studies 
teacher. Len indicated that the work he had done with this teacher demonstrated how he could 
"throw a thought to the kids" in a more open ended way. 



Although his mentors had left the school, they had instilled a tendency toward hard work. 
As a result, the energy level Len felt was needed for teaching and his habit of expending energy 
were developed early: 



Once you get into that mode of keep hustlin'! or Keep movin'! it becomes a habit. I think 
if I had gotten into a mode where it was all planned out, I probably would have followed 
that. Although, I think I would have gotten quite bored. Y ou know, it's part of what 
you're used to. When I got here I was around these really good teachers, so 1 had to start 
hustlin' to keep up with these guys who [were] doing a great job! Then, once you start 
doing it, you don't want to fall back! 

Observations indicated that Len continued to physically hustle after 30 years of teaching. 
Advising a weekly ecology club, spending 2 extra hours at school each day, and constantly trying 
to find new ways to engage his students occupied much of his time. 



7. "A work in progress." Len's constantly evolving and continuing 
vision of his assessment future coupled with his reflection on the level 
of his students' on-task engagement, fostered his acceptance, and 
ultimate level of use of alternative assessment. 

member check: 



"Len saw assessment as dynamic as he couples his reflection on the 
level of student on-task engagement with his constantly evolving and 
continuing vision of his assessment future . " 

When it came to assessment strategies, Len considered himself "a work in progress." He 
was quite aware that the assessment strategies he was using were not perfect. However, he felt 
they were better than what he had used in the past and he was constantly adapting them as he 
went along. He spoke of change in his assessment that began to occur between 1975 to 1985 and 
how he currently reflected upon aspects of assessment primarily in his 35 minute car ride to and 
from school. 

Len reiterated that when he spoke of alternative assessments, he was talking about the 
activities that he had students doing. He re-emphasized that his goals were "student engagement 
and fun." He felt the assessments (activities) should be fun because "they engage kids more if 
they were." The alternative assessments Len used also provided him a "clearer picture into 
students on task engagement." He felt that using the different forms of assessment "allowed 




787 



different kids to express their worth in different ways." As Len thought about the assessments he 
used, he adapted them to fit each class. For example, using one form of assessment permitted 
Len to witness his students' previously unknown abilities. He stated: "I didn't realize the visual 
part [of assessment] was so important until I started doing it. Until I started having kids turn 
these things out, I didn't know how talented they were." 

Len thought that what he was doing in terms of assessment was useful for him and "he 
was on the right track with research and a good deal ahead of his colleagues." He based his 
comparison with his colleagues on brief interactions and discussions in the science office. In 
short, he "felt pretty good about where [he] was." 

Despite Len's feeling of being ahead of his colleagues in terms of alternative assessment 
use, he was not sure about how much students would learn using any different form of 
assessment, but he felt, "everything says the more different senses you get involved in the 
learning the more likely it is to be retained." Although Len felt he was headed in the right 
direction in terms of assessment, the assessment strategies he used had different effects in both 
classes, which caused him to reflect on his teaching. 

Len was confident he would continue to change and adapt in the future. His intentions 
were to "keep refining" what he was doing so that his students could see what he was trying "to 
shoot for and what they should produce." As his refinements continued, he humbly stated the 
changes he saw happening over the years: 

Am I approaching my vision? Approaching some ideal? I think I'm doing what I set out 
to do. I gauge my kids, I watch my kids. I'm judging 1) are they doing what I asked them 
to do? 2) are they interacting with each other in a positive way? 3) are they picking up the 
content?, and 4) are they having some sort of problem that I can see? 

Ultimately, Len felt assessment should grow to a point that students could effectively use 
it for themselves. They could see what they knew and didn't know and hopefully pursue ways to 
fill the gaps in their understanding. Len felt confident and "pretty good that [he] had grown in 
terms of assessment."

8. Arriving early to school, staying late after school, working 
weekends, expending large amounts of physical energy, and 
possessing other qualities of an exemplary teacher, facilitated Leris 
use of alternative assessments within his standard 50 minute 
period. 

member check: 

"Len feels it requires time outside of the regular 50 minute periods, and 
daily teacher routines, to create meaningful assessment strategies, reflect 
upon what skills the students are exhibiting, decide what needs to be 
focused on next, and plan how to include student input into the 
assessments . " 

Observations indicated that Len worked on assessment strategies and evaluated student 
products both during and after school hours. Len perceived his use of time out of class as 
necessary and he felt the he was "still relatively new at [assessment]." Working on his 
assessment ideas out of school helped him change and he mentioned that "if [he] had not 
changed, [he] would have gotten bored." 

Leris openness to change also led him to using cooperative learning. Since much of his 
alternative assessments required group work, Len assessed students with questions as he walked 
from group to group. While walking around to each group provided him with informal 
assessments of his students' abilities and understanding, he still found the action of moving from 
group to group very physically demanding. Conversely, he found "it easier to stand up and talk 
to [students] from time to time." 

At the end of each day, Len indeed had an exhausted appearance. Interviews at the end 
of each school day during site visits indicated Leris energy level had dropped noticeably from 
the morning. Upon one occasion, he appeared extremely tired. After being questioned about 
how he felt physically, Len remarked, "Today was pretty tiring and I've got a lot of stuff to do 
before tomorrow." 

Len described his instruction while students were in groups as "causing a lot of wear and 
tear [on him]. It's a lot harder to get up and get around." He continued to speak about the 
amount of physical energy required for him to do what he felt was right for his students, that is. 




789 



812 



getting them in groups to work on projects, which were some of his alternative assessments. Len 
felt that getting students involved in groups caused "action that drained [him]." 

It was easy to see that Len did indeed, as he described, "work his can off!" He required at 
least one weekend day and most late weekday evenings to create and adapt the assessments he 
used. One of Len's interests at home was being creative in the development and adaptation of 
activities and assessments. He offered, "I would sooner sit down and create new activities than I 
would grade a stack of papers." His creativity was able to be used at home and he enjoyed the 
process. BioCom also provided alternative assessment ideas that he felt had strengths and 
weaknesses that he changed to fit his needs. 

Len commented about factors in his personal life that enabled him to be creative with 
assessments and develop new activities while he worked at home. He spoke of the support from 
his family as being very important in allowing him to continue: "I could not do the things that I 
do if my wife wasn't cooperative and my son wasn't cooperative, because that's where more of 
my energy would have to go." 

Although Len reaffirmed that he would continue to use and adapt his assessments, he 
admitted he had to find more time at home. He spoke of a goal he had been developing over the 
past few years: 

One of the things I have to do, frankly, is to find more ways to use less time. Because of 
all the time I was spending on school work, I was finding that I wasn't doing much at 
home. I saw that [my family] wasn't going out and having some fun, or having time for 
the hobby type stuff: [1] just didn't do it! I've been spending all my time up there on that 
computer or grading papers or creating activities, or watching video [assessments] from 
students, or at school teaching. I see other [science teachers] going home at 3:30 or 4:00 
p.m. and I'm here plugging away at 5:00 or 5:30. Then I go home and do more [school] 
stuff. 

Observations matched almost perfectly with Len's beliefs of what his actions were. He 
was at school at least one hour early and indeed, stayed daily until 5:00 or later. Visits to his 
home indicated much time spent on school work. Len had an office within his house where his 
computer sat on a desk, surrounded by curricular ideas, exams, and a plethora of other teaching 
resources. 




790 



Although Len wanted to "find more ways to use less time," he felt there was ample time 
to use alternative assessments. "The time is there to do alternative assessments, it just needs to 
be rearranged. Despite some of the barriers to an ideal teaching situation, there seemed to be 
many indications that Len spent much more than 40 hours each week on educational activities, of 
which development and adaptation of the assessments was a part 

Note: Member checks were not able to be obtained for generalizations 9 through 13. The 
following five generalizations were based on data and researcher interpretations alone because 
students were only available for limited times. 

9. Past experiences of Len's students affected their current 
perceptions of assessment reality in his class. 

Assessment meant "evaluation" to almost all the 9th grade students interviewed during 
this study. Furthermore, evaluation meant grades. While Len's grade book reflects a multitude 
of assessments of differing value, most students felt Len's tests were the primary determiner of 
their grades. Interestingly, those student whom Len would consider as having the "most talent" 
or "the greatest ability" realized the BioLog was "worth more" total points, yet focused a 
disproportionate amount of energy on the test. Ongoing observations and interviews indicated 
that Len's students had considerable experience with tests being primary determiners of what 
they considered evaluation leading to grades. 

Most students defined assessment as either "teacher evaluation of you" or "what you do 
to get a grade." Though Len used a variety of assessment to determine students' knowledge or 
abilities, students had mixed views about the goals of Len's assessment, what counted most, and 
what they knew from past experiences. 

Overall, students' views of assessment reality had no common thread. Assessment 
experiences students had in past years were markedly different between individuals. For 
instance, depending on which junior high a student came from, they were either familiar with 
multiple-choice tests, essays, projects, or worksheets as means of assessments. A few students 
had some experience with logs while others had never heard of a log prior to Len's class. 





791 



However, the factor that seemed to hold true among all student respondents was that Len's tests 
were very difficult for them compared to what they were used to from prior science classes. 

One of the most interesting aspects of students' perceived reality was their focus on Len's 
tests. Observations and student interviews indicated that the majority of student energy was 
spent taking notes for the single test and quiz during the quarter. Although the total 55 points of 
the test only amounted to 16% of the grade, many students indicated they spent untold hours 
writing all possible notes into their logs. When asked about the reasons there was such a focus 
on these test when it was not a large percent of the total grade, one student commented in a 
surprised voice; "Oh! I guess it's just that other teachers grade tests more than anything else." It 
became apparent that only as students began to think about the ways in which Len really assessed 
them did some begin to broaden their perceptions of the assessments they were experiencing. 

10. Students worked toward learning goals only if an extrinsic 
reward existed either in the form of points or grades. 

There was strong indication that students who cared about their grades focused on 
studying their notes for tests so they "get a good grade." There sole purpose was not to learn the 
material for the sake of learning, but to get "enough points for a good grade." Likewise, when 
given a scenario in which all grades were removed from assessment, all students interviewed 
stated the quality of their work would "go down" if grades were removed. Even the students Len 
considered most academic said they "wouldn't try" if their work was not evaluated with points 
assigned to it: 

Researcher: "What would it be like in a science class without grades?" 

Student It would make your quality worse because you wouldn't worry about it. Y ou 
wouldn’t worry about grades because there wouldn't be any point for grades. 
You'd probably just want to get through [the class], and want to get the class 
over with. You'd always be worrying for the bell to ring. You'd just want to 
get outta there! 

Student I don't think we'd try as hard [without grades]. We wouldn't pay any attention 
in class. You just don't have the time to bother with stuff that doesn't have 
any points. Points are there to make you learn. It's not a bad thing to have 
points. It keeps you going! 




792 



815 



Students view grades as levels of "smart" or "dumb". Most commented about those who 
received "As and Bs" as "smart" and those receiving a "C" or lower as "dumb." One student took 
this notion one step farther and related views that parents might have regarding grades. This 
student believed parents respected the grade given by the teacher; "what the teacher thinks is 
what the parents are going to think. If he gives you and 'F, then you obviously don't know this 
stuff!" Although Len told his students; "there is some value to learning", he felt it really was not 
believed by his students. He thought, "to have the kids [leam] because you say 'this is good for 
you!' It's just not going to happen!" Len was unsure of the reason why his students actually 
worked in class but remarked about the motivations that his students might have had. He thought 
some of his students may "have had a change in attitude and began to like learning." He also 
thought that some students might be "deciding to jump through hoops just to get [him] off their 
back for the grade." Whatever the reasons, students had for participating, Len was not sure of 
what they were. 

Len's rationale for grades was equated to "paying [students] points like a salary." The 
trick he said, "is to make the awarding of points understandable. Then, they can come to me and 
discuss if they want to accept it or reject it" With most of his assessments, Len used rubrics on 
which to base a student's grade. Although he admitted "getting stuck" on some criteria, they 
were nonetheless used to assign the points for the grade. Len ultimately felt that most students 
would "try to get by doing as little work as possible anyhow" and he believed that only a small 
portion of his students actually put forth effort "because it was good for them." 

11. Students felt they did best when they: worked in cooperative 
groups, took fewer tests, did projects, were active in class, and 
experienced less teacher talk. 

Len had a vision of what kids should and should not be doing while they were in groups: 

One of the things with cooperative learning is that you can't just throw kids together. 

They don't know what they're supposed to do. They're just going to be together and 
screw around. So when you do true cooperative learning, they've got roles they're 
supposed to carry out and then they're supposed to be checking on each other, and that's 
where there is supposed to be the individual accountability as well.

While Len focused on the assessment regarding the collaborative nature and task 
orientation of group work, the students saw it from an enjoyment perspective. Almost every 
student interviewed spoke of the positive aspects of working in groups. Indeed, a majority of 
times that students were observed in group work during class, they demonstrated many on-task 
behaviors including: discussing the project at hand with each other, organizing thoughts, or 
working on completing a poster, drawing a model or similar activity. 

Many students felt they worked best and learned most when they produced projects and 
worked in group at things. Many also felt that they were best able to show what they knew and 
understood about biological concepts via projects presentations. Each of the following responses 
is from a different student responding at different times to questions dealing with times they have 
positive feelings and attitudes in Len's class: 



Student: Group work is best. We can talk to people about stuff and they'll understand 

it. I like the Congress. Our group had so much fun with that! It was the best 
project that we had in science class. 

Student: Our cell factory was fun, where he had us use our creativity to design how the 

parts of the cell factory worked. So you had to understand the cell before you 
could made a factory. So I like know you really had to understand the cell 
before you could do it. 

Researcher What's different about building a model and taking a test? 

Student: When you're doing a model, you know exactly what is expected of you, like 

the cell factory. When we take a test, it can be on like a lot of different 
things. The test you study the night before and then you probably forget 
everything the day after the test. 

Student: Like when we did the cell factory, I really understood the parts when we 

did that. When you put things in words that we know. I really understood 
it, I was sure about that. All the cell parts - we had to make a poster of a 
cell factory and explain how everything worked. 

Student: I think I like projects better. I think tests will show you what you know, but 

projects will let you apply it. You can know something and you can see 
how things are affected. Tests will tell you the same things, like what you 
know and what you need to go back and look at, but projects are a lot more 
fun, more hands on than circling a bubble or something. 

Student: I’m glad we have a lot of projects! They are a lot more fun to do. 



Some students spoke of projects and group work as definitive in demonstrating their 
knowledge of a subject. 

12. Despite Len's goals of student self-assessment, the majority of 
students were either uncomfortable assessing themselves or more 
comfortable [confident] in having Len assess them instead. 

Len felt it important for students to begin to take responsibility for their own learning. 

He employed at least four methods to accomplish this: Student self-reflection in their logs, 
group evaluation, BioCom self-checks, and having the students develop some of their own 
criteria for projects. However, only a few of those students interviewed from the 7th hour class 
were able to articulate what Len's goals were or saw similar merit in assessing themselves. Even 
the most talented students were not excited about having to evaluate their friends when the time 
came to use the criteria they had developed. 

Len had given written expectations for self-reflection in the student logs early in the 
semester. These expectations reflected Len's goal for student self-reflection. Students were to 
write down what they learned or felt about class daily. However, the majority of students did not 
write as Len expected. He suggested a possible explanation for the student concern was that, 
"they may have never done this before. " 

Both classes had a team of four judges. As all other groups worked on their Biodiversity 
Infomercial, the judges moved from group to group collecting different project criteria from 
students. The end results were student developed rubrics in both the 7th and 8th hour classes. 

Students looked favorably upon development of their own criteria. Both classes of 
judges offered mixed emotions on the power that was bestowed upon them. A few student 
judges "liked it! Who is better to know about what we are capable of than us?" Others did not 
because of the light hearted "judge bashing" that occurred after scores were rendered.

No visible problems were observed or spoken about by students while rubrics were being 
developed. However, when the time came to evaluate the group presentation, an uneasy feeling 
became clear in both groups of judges. The student judges were very uncomfortable evaluating 
their peers. The personal bonds that existed at that age were stronger than the objective criteria 
they had just developed. Students commented that they felt uncomfortable grading their friends 
because of the "hard feelings" that might occur. One group did in fact, accuse a judge of "being 
too hard on [them]" in front of the entire class. To avoid further student embarrassment, Len 
stepped in and discussed the notion of consistency. That is, he told the students that it was "OK 
to be conservative as long as that person was consistent throughout each group." This sounded 
like a fair explanation, but nonetheless, the judges felt uneasy. One student suggested, "it might 
work if they had more than four judges" but did not suggest what a critical number would be. 

Despite some student argument over their scores, Len was confident that his students 
would begin to understand quality and quantity based on criteria: "As they go along, they should 
come to realize that there will be more and more evidence. There are. I'm sure, some students 
who haven't quite got the evidence part yet. The way I assess kids is to give them a chance to see 
what goes into making a decent student or what should go into making a decent student. I guess 
since I try to look at a more total package, I want them to look at that as well." Len further 
articulated his rationale for having students develop their own criteria: 



Ideally, what I want [student developed criteria and self-assessment] to be used for is for 
them to understand where this is all coming from! That it is not some sort of magic. 

That it's not the person at the front of the room that is doing all the determination, that if 
they bother to use their heads, they can pretty well determine what they are going to be 
getting, what their grade is. 

When it came to self-evaluations, most students interviewed felt they were "harder on 
themselves than what [Len] would be." As one explained, "a lot of times you put yourself down. 
You might not think you did well, but other people might think that you did really good." 

Despite the fear of a negative feeling toward the judges from their peers, they were able to 
articulate the benefits of creating their own criteria: "I think it's a good idea. Because the teacher 
might have higher expectations, but we're like, younger and we know about our age what we 



0 

ERIC 



797 



820 



should be able to do. So, I think it's a good thing." This same student expressed self-grading 
[assessing] as having positive outcomes: 



Ideas from our grade level are good. Looking for things that we can achieve. We don t 
know everything our teacher knows and we never know what we're getting graded on. I 
think it's a good that we have a chance to grade ourselves from things we made up that 
are important to us. You have a chance to make things more comfortable for people that 
don't like to get up in front of groups and give presentations. 

It should be noted that only the more articulate 9th grade students were able to verbally 
express the benefits of generating their own criteria. The students best able to explain what they 
felt were also those who spoke most freely and often in class and remained on task the majority 
of the time during group work. 

13. Len's colleagues perceived alternative assessments as requiring 
too much time for the number of students they were responsible for. 

Since Len had both personal and professional contact with some of the science 
teachers, it was considered important to this research to ascertain their beliefs about 
alternative assessment and to see what impact they may have had on Len or he on them. 

While Len was never observed discussing anything formally regarding assessment with his 
colleagues, he indicated briefly discussing assessment ideas with "one or two individuals 
from time to time." He also had the "feeling that he was ahead of [his] colleagues in terms of 
assessment because of conventions and things like that." 

A few of the teachers interviewed made statements regarding Len's attempts at 
alternative assessment. Keith, the ChemCom teacher said, "I know I'm no where near where 
Len is in terms of assessment." Another biology teacher said, "I know I should be doing 
more, but I just can't bring myself to do the subjective types of assessment that Len does." 

The colleague interviews resulted in a list of barriers to their use of alternative assessment 
including: lack of time in concert with too many students, training/further education, support for 
district, sharing classrooms, the personal factors of not willing to take risks or try new things, 
personal constraints, and "too much curriculum to cover already." The perceptions of the 




798 



colleagues were most strongly centered around a combination of having "too many students and 
too little time to even try anything new." 

Janet was the busy principal at Suburban High School. She quickly admitted to having 
only a "limited understanding of alternative assessment strategies in science." However, Janet 
felt her district "was trying to become better at alternative assessments." She was most familiar 
with the English faculty, who were using portfolios. Janet thought her science staff was 
growing, but was unable to express any knowledge of assessment practices currently being used 
in the science department 

Note: The final two generalizations relate directly to Len and therefore, will have member 
checks. 

14. Len felt confident, yet alone and humble among his colleagues 
regarding his use of alternative assessments: He felt he was a 
"Lone Ranger" at times. 

member check: 



"Yes!" 

While Len was trying new assessment strategies, he never mentioned his colleagues as 

doing a poor job when it came to assessment strategies they employed. Even his strongest hint 

of having more knowledge than his colleagues came as he stated: "I feel I am ahead of my 

colleagues because of conferences and such." Never once did Len speak poorly about his peers, 

only that "some were doing the best they could," and "some were stuck in a rut." He continued: 

You still have that 'tried and true bunch'. Most of the teachers have degrees and have 
gone through these programs and were successful at the old methods. Good memorizers, 
good content people. 

Regardless of what his colleagues were doing, Len felt confident in all the new 

assessment strategies he tried because they both satisfied his "goals for students" and were "fun." 

Despite his confidence, Len was honest about his feelings about his knowledge of teaching: 

A lot of times I feel dumb if you really want to know the truth! (laughter) Some people 
think they know the answer to everything. I never felt that way, I always felt a little 
stupid! I feel the same way about teaching. I never felt that I quite have all the right 
answers, so I just kept out there, doing this or that. Part of it is an uneasiness that I'm not 
reaching as many students as you could, or, it's a part that I'm trying to do the best job 
that I can. 




799 



822 



Even though all his colleagues felt he was a "great guy", "exemplary teacher", and "not a 
finer educator could be found," Len was aware of some inadequacies regarding the extent of his 
abilities and effectiveness. 

Attending conventions was a first step in demonstrating to Len that he was actually a 
leader in alternative assessment practices which gave him confidence to go on. However, 
"spreading the word" within his own faculty was not one of his priorities. Len was respected a 
great deal by his colleagues, likewise, he respected most of them and would only consider 
offering suggestions if asked: 

I'm not much of a salesman to try to make others do it the same way so where there may 
be people in the department that might benefit by it, I can show [my colleagues] what's 
out there and they can choose to pick it up or not. I don't know if [forcing] would be all 
that effective with the kind of people we have around here. So, you can only show them 
what's been working for you and I feel pretty good about that. 

Months later, Len had similar feelings. He commented on how he, indeed, tried to share his 

ideas with others: 

I'm not much of a crusader. I don't feel comfortable telling others 'I am right and you're 
not.' Or, 'Isn't it time to change your strategies'. I share practically all I have and do with 
those I teach with (save a "leech" or two). I do get the reaction 'I don't have the time' or 'I 
can't get the kids to...' or 'I wouldn't know how to grade something like that' all too 
frequently, but I figure they might get inspired some time. I also think that there are 
those that actively don't WANT to know because they see it as meaning more work for 
them to have to re-tool in some way. I do know that I am generally in better control of 
my classes, have better luck with the more 'difficult' student, am generally happier with 
my kids, and what I am doing than, those that are still in their rut. 

Len not only saw his field testing of BioCom during this research as change, he felt he 

had been making progressive and positive change his entire career. Knowing his limitations, he 

remained humble throughout the duration of this research as he reflected many times: 

I am doing some things. Am I doing them as well as I could? Probably not. I think I'm 
"a work in progress." I think back somewhere that that's what I was. Nobody was perfect 
but in fact [I was] always working toward that. It really fits my story. 

Because there was little time for formal idea sharing, Len was virtually alone in his use 
and knowledge of alternative assessment. 




800 



823 



15. Len had philosophical visions of alternative assessment use and 
the role it played in the life of a teacher: "In the ideal world", 
member check: 

"Yes — and really ( and maybe more importantly), in the life of the 
students too . " 

Len had definite ideas on what he felt was necessary for successful implementation of 

assessment strategies similar to what he was using. Len expressed his feelings this way: 

If you are going to sit down for the first time and really work through new assessments, 
how they work, what are they about, it takes time to work your way through that. If 
you're going to create an activity from scratch, it takes time. You have to have time to 
learn everything you are going to use. So, as you create the assessments and you create 
the assessment documents, that takes a world of time! So, if I didn't have that time to sit 
down, I wouldn't be doing it. I sometimes feel a bit overwhelmed at the number of 
different things that do go on. There are teachers that are not risk takers who would say, 

'Oh, I won't do role playing because I haven't done that before.' How the hell are you 
going to do it if you don't give it a shot? How are you going to be willing to give a shot? 

Part of it is maybe, I have been willing to settle for less than perfection at times, which in 
some people it's harder than others. If you can get that kind of mind set then, you can be 
a risk taker in a lot of respects, because you are doing the best you can. Now, 'can you do 
it better the next time?' "Yeah! Now that I've seen it once, I can do it better the next 
time!' But, you did it best right then. 

Len felt he was a risk taker and also felt many other teachers were not. Along with taking 
risks, Len suggested four ideals that most teachers would need to begin to use alternative 
assessments in a meaningful way. He felt teachers needed their own room and a greater amount 
of time to plan, try, reflect on, and adapt assessments. Block scheduling may be an option for 
time, and have fewer students per class. Len also felt teachers needed to "perceive alternative 
assessments as less work rather than more." Len believed the science teachers he knew would 
not try any new assessment strategies if they saw them as more work than what they were doing. 
He and his colleagues gave many examples of their busy work schedules and the overwhelming 
feelings of responsibilities they often had. While Len found ways to offset barriers to alternative 
assessment implementation, he was very confident that others would not be as adventuresome as 
he in terms of the assessment strategies he was currently using. 

When Len considered his own situation, he realized the limitations to both instructions 
and assessment that came as a result of sharing classrooms with other teachers. Len pushed a 
small movie projector cart to and from two different classrooms. Each day the cart contained 



O 

ERIC 



801 



what he needed for that day's lesson. Len dreamed of a day that he could say; "No more carts for 
us old farts!" 

While Len felt teaching from a single room and having teachers perceive alternative 
assessment strategies as requiring less work, time and class size were factors he considered most 
critical for the majority of teachers to "buy in." Len first discussed how little time he had to 
share ideas with his colleagues: 

Time just isn't there! You know we have official meetings. The after school stuff is 
about the only time and there's not much of that because people have all these other 
responsibilities. In our district, all that's talked about now [regarding assessment] are the 
mandated state science rubrics. They're a pain in the ass! 

While not able to talk to his colleagues about assessment on a regular basis because of 

time constraints, Len also felt he even had little time to reflect on his own ideas: 

I was just thinking today, about a simple thing, having my own time to reflect on what's 
going on. And even that simple thing of sitting down and reflecting. I have a book that I 
keep assignments in. I'm three days behind on that already! I don't find myself wasting 
time, it's because everything is always going on! Then when you change classes, you're 
trying to get some things done or you try to talk to an occasional friend or two, then you 
have clubs and you have work when you get home and try to do that kind of thing. It's 
hard! It's really hard! Let alone sitting down thinking on what I want to reflect on what 
I'm doing. It's just a real difficult thing to do. Maybe I could get by on three hours of 
sleep instead of four! [laughter] It's just the way it is around here! Sometimes I get 35 
minutes on the drive to work that I use for reflection. 

Len said he often thought at length about his use of school time and the way it was 

scheduled. He was able to explain his thoughts on both his feelings of time and how time might 

be better organized to allow teachers to assess students in a more meaningful way: 

I don't think I've really changed my viewpoint about alternative assessment and time. 

The role playing, hearings, etc., do require more time and would benefit from larger 
blocks of time - to reach closure or some natural break points, but the anecdotal 
comments, checklists, group, and self-evaluations, etc., do not require extended class 
periods, sometimes I think it would be nice to have some individual interview time too. 
Don't forget I've been "geared" to 50 minute periods for almost 30 years, so I've learned 
to just do it - 'rushing' seems like a natural way of teaching life. It's just more thinking 
time, more time! If you're doing projects, 7 groups takes longer than 5 groups. 

Len continued by offering block scheduling as a viable option. He indicated his science 

department chair (Keith) had given him an article that provided him with plausible ways of 

restructuring time in schools: 




802 825 



Block scheduling could also allow for some better interdisciplinary and alternative 
assessment focus as well, because kids could be doing the related math, related reading, 
and creative research, etc. in other classes. You could really build some interesting 
problem-based learning scenarios. Keith gave me an interesting article on [block 
scheduling]. Strangely enough their comments parallel mine nicely, only in a much more 
detailed manner. They also have some concrete examples. It was: Using Time Well: 
Scheduling in Essential Schools by Kathleen Cushman from a publication called 
HORACE put out by The Coalition of Essential Schools. [Volume 12, Number 2], 
November 1995. 

Although Len felt time was a critical component for successful alternative assessment 
use, his biggest concern was still over class size. Len had 28 students in most of his five classes. 
Yet, he felt he successfully implemented a number of alternative assessments. However, he was 
not as sure about other teachers wishing to try, and simultaneously be successful with alternative 
assessments with such large groups of students: 



In the ideal world, it would be nice to have one less class, it would be nice to have four 
rather than five as they are in some schools. It would be nice to have classes of 20 or 22, 
we have classes of 28. It makes a big difference in how you are willing to assess! If you 
have fewer kids and fewer assessments, I think you have more of a willingness to use 
some of the alternative assessment strategies that would require more time of you. The 
principal will tell you 'there is no real hard data that small class size makes a difference.' 
Smaller classes just makes a better atmosphere. Period! The kids have a little more 
room, they can spread out a little more, you can get to the same kids more than once, you 
can get to their lab group more than twice in a class period. It makes a difference, I don't 
care what anybody tells me! I can see it. 

Len supplied a practical example of the time required for using one alternative 
assessment he used: 

I've got seven audio and video tapes per class and it's going to take me an hour to do a 
class. It took me longer than that to do Logs! 

Although Len was able to implement what he considered alternative assessments in the 
same world as his colleagues, he ultimately felt several factors could be addressed so that a 
majority of teachers wishing to use more meaningful forms of assessment could do so. Factors 
Len felt would help teachers do a better job with assessment included: 1) a daily school schedule 
that was designed so that students could spend more time with one teacher and on more lengthy 
projects, 2) reduction of a terrific work load that already had teachers working to a high capacity, 
3) providing teachers with their own classroom so that students could have longer-term projects 
going and/or more challenging assessments could be designed, 4) provide some time for sharing. 




803 826 



trying, reflecting, and adapting, and 5) reducing class size to under 22 so that more contact time 
could be developed between the teacher and student. Len felt that if the educational system 
would address all, or part of these factors, some may act in concert to help teachers begin to use 
alternative assessments as he had: more now than in the past 

Plausible Implications for Science Teacher Educators 

"When teachers act in the classroom, they do what makes sense to them in their 

circumstances" 

K. Tobin (1990) 

What might this all mean to science educators? Surely, findings from this case can only 
be used for the participants from this case. There was never any intention to generalize findings 
to any other situation, yet, many problems mentioned by Len and his colleagues are faced by 
other teachers. Some of the problems encountered by Len do have the potential to be addressed 
in part by science educators. Some plausible actions follow that science educators may wish to 
consider if there is indeed an interest in getting more meaningful science assessments into the 
classrooms. 

Clearly, most science educators wish students to be involved in rich, scientific 
investigations that have them often using hands-on manipulatives, which aid them in answering 
their own questions. Likewise, rich assessments of students would include unstructured tasks 
(Wiggins, 1993 c), portfolios (Collins, 1992) or other performance assessments (Boycoff Baron, 
1991). While this may be the ideal, Len discussed multiple factors which would impact the 
successful implementation of a consistent menu of rich assessments including: class size, student 
attitudes, available materials, and time, to name a few. 

Alternatives to traditional tests might indeed provide the teacher and the student with 
higher levels of understanding in both process skills and content However, the total package of 
variables that Len suggested which might lead to the ultimate in a successful implementation of 
rich assessments could easily be argued as not currently existing in most schools. In Len s case 





he was "doing the best he could" for the situation he was presented with and the level of 
understanding he currently held for assessment 

It seems that two key factors determined Len's perceived level of success in using 
alternative assessments. The first was his willingness to take a risk. The second was that he was 
shown or modeled an example, permitting him to "give it a try" in his classroom. For him, these 
models occurred at workshops or conferences. Providing pre-service teachers of science, models 
of alternative assessments which show natural links to grading and time management seems to be 
a logical way of promoting, if not at least reinforcing their later use. Alternative assessment 
examples should be research-based and pre-service teachers should be given ample time to 
practice using them so they begin their profession with an understanding about what meaningful 
assessments look like and how they are used. 

In addition, the assessment strategies modeled in a pre-service program should 
demonstrate how assessment and instruction are inseparable when real learning is the goal. If 
assessment strategies in preservice programs model meaningful assessments and rise above 
multiple choice questions, there may be a greater chance they will be used when teachers begin 
their careers. 

Since grades are still a definite issue in schools and valued above all else by students, 
parents, and administration, pre-service teachers may need shown methods for obtaining scores 
for any type of alternative assessment. Modeling rubric use and adding student-generated criteria 
in a science methods class may provide the examples necessary for these future teachers to 
implement rubrics with their own students. These rubrics would demonstrate a tool that bases 
student effort and skills against a pre-established set of criteria rather than a comparison between 
students. 

Attending and presenting at science teacher conferences surely had an impact on Len's 
use of alternative assessments. First, attending conferences provided him support in "knowing he 
was doing the right thing," and presenting his "wares" to "packed rooms," filled with biology 
teachers eager to learn "about what he was doing," gave him the collegial support (albeit outside 



his school) to continue. It could be logically argued then, that attending and presenting at 
conferences contributes to keeping this teacher active and growing. Providing information to 
pre-service science teachers regarding upcoming conferences and strongly promoting and 
encouraging their attendance may well contribute to student confidence level and understanding 
regarding the use of alternative assessments. 

Len's story as told by this researchers is by no means conclusive and cannot be directly 
compared to other science teachers. However, Len continues to this day to try new assessments 
and adapts proven methods to his new teaching scenarios. Len admitted that even after 30 years 
he was still learning. The most he could offer this researcher was that he was deeply concerned 
about his teaching and engaging his students. Len was simply doing the best he could for his 
situation. This researcher would agree.

PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT WITH PRESERVICE ELEMENTARY 
TEACHERS: IS IT WORTH THE EFFORT? 



Mark D. Guy, University of North Dakota 
Jackie Wilcox, University of North Dakota 

Introduction 

Performance tasks in science education have continued to gain credibility as an 
appropriate strategy for assessing students’ science conceptual understandings and use of process 
skills (e g.. National Science Education Standards, 1996; Hein & Price, 1994). Lehman (1994) 
has also recommended performance tasks for assessing preservice teachers’ ability to investigate 
science phenomena and use scientific equipment. Yet, an underlying goal of an elementary 
science methods course is to help preservice teachers learn to teach science as inquiry and develop 
something akin to “pedagogical content knowledge” (after Shulman). A central question for 
teacher educators becomes how to assess (in alternative ways to paper and pencil tasks) the ability 
of elementary preservice teaches to develop science inquiry experiences for young learners. 

The purpose of this study was to document the implementation of a pedagogically- 
oriented performance assessment component within two elementary science methods courses 
spanning two semesters. Phase I denotes the first semester of the study while Phase II refers to 
the second semester. Assessment rubric notes, student feedback forms, and instructor field notes 
made up the data for the study. The focus of the performance assessment was on the preservice 
teachers’ pedagogical thinking about science inquiry rather than their science background 
knowledge or their ability to conduct a scientific experiment. Phase II of the study reflected 
several revisions from the original assessment experience and is elaborated in the paper. 





811 



Phase I 



Fifty-six elementary education majors from two sections of a science methods course 
participated in the performance assessment near the end of the semester long course during the 
spring semester, 1996. The performance task description, science topic, and scoring rubric (see 
Table 1) were given to the preservice teachers ahead of time for their review. Working with an 
assigned partner, they were asked to perform the following task: Show and discuss how the topic 
of “Sound” could be taught as inquiry using the everyday materials provided. 

The teachers were given five minutes to collect their thoughts and fifteen minutes to 
articulate their pedagogical ideas. Each of the two instructors administered the assessment using 
the same science topic, format, and scoring rubric. The role of the instructors was to facilitate a 
discussion about the topic and to guide the teachers through the various categories of the 
assessment. 



Table 1 

Performance Assessment Task and Scoring Rubric 



You will be given some everyday materials with which to conceptualize and discuss 
several science inquiry opportunities with learners. The topic will be the study of SOUND. Key 
concepts: sounds are produced by vibrations; more mass, the slower the vibration, lower the 
pitch; higher frequency the vibration the higher the pitch; the loudness (amplitude) or pitch 
(frequency) of sounds can be changed. Sound waves can travel through gases, liquids (faster), 
and solids (fastest). Assessment session: 20 minutes.

The scoring rubric was used as a template for the instructors to write preservice teacher 
responses, their own comments, and score the different categories. Copies of these notes and 
scores were shared with the teachers after the assessment. Teachers were also asked to 
anonymously evaluate the performance assessment in terms of the following: 1) value of the 
experience; 2) interaction with the instructor; 3) their own performance on the assessment; and 4) 
recommendations for future assessment practices. 

Phase I Findings 

Preservice Teacher Performance 

Overall, the teachers performed very successfully in articulating their views about teaching 
science as inquiry and covering all the categories listed in the rubric. Although the topic (sound) 
and rubric were known ahead of time, the preservice teachers did not see the materials to be used 
until the moment of the assessment and were challenged intellectually to use the available 
materials as props to demonstrate their thinking in a coherent and meaningful way. 

Preservice Teacher Perspective 
Practical Value 

The teachers believed that the performance assessment held a practical value for them in 
that they were demonstrating what they had learned and were utilizing common everyday 
materials to create inquiry. This is exemplified by these remarks: “I was able to apply abstract 
learning in a concrete way.” “It tied together everything we've discussed and focused on this 



semester.” “It let me verbalize my thoughts and feelings about how to use materials in my 
classroom.” 

Conversational Interaction with Instructor 

The teachers also felt the conversational interaction with the instructor produced a 
comfortable, yet serious environment for the assessment. “It was like having a normal 
conversation. We were able to show what we learned without having to worry.” “Liked how the 
teacher gave chance to explain thoughts yet continued to probe on things he wanted more 
elaborated.” “We were asked probing questions that made us analyze our thinking.” 

Time Constraint 

The participants often noted that too little time was allowed for the assessment. “Allow 
more time to complete the process.” “Maybe allow a few more minutes for preparation. Time 
became a factor and I did feel a little rushed.” 

Topic Anxiety 

The topic of “sound” used in the assessment was not familiar to many students and was 
not a topic covered in the course. This contributed to anxiety among many of the students. 
“Have choices on what to be assessed on. I didn't feel very comfortable with sound because we 
didn't even cover it in class.” “Pick an idea or experiment that we have gone over in class. For 
example instead of sound, we could've had magnetism because we did something with that in 
class.” “Give students more background on the subject.” “I felt a little anxious beforehand 
because we were being assessed on sound— something we had not studied at all as a team during 
the semester. I thought this was strange because we have been taught to assess on what the 
students know.” 




814 



837 



Beneficial Experience 

There was a general consensus among the participants that they were pleased with their 
performance and felt they did well. It was also felt that this type of assessment should be 
continued. “It is a helpful addition to building students' confidence in constructivist teaching.” 
“This type of assessment is much better than a final. You actually get to put your knowledge and 
hands on activity to work.” “Do more of this throughout the whole semester, not just at the end. 
This type of activity makes you think hard and be creative and I think that's a valuable assessment 
for constructivist science.” 

Instructor Perspective 

The assessment was viewed as a very positive experience for both instructors of the 
science methods course. It was felt that this type of assessment reflected their students' 
understanding of the inquiry-based approach to teaching science that had been modeled by the 
instructors throughout the semester. The assessment also provided the students with an 
opportunity to pull together the pedagogical content knowledge that had been presented 
throughout the course and apply it to a new situation. “I liked the insight I gained about how 
inquiry is built as I listened to the students do their thinking aloud and to observe them using their 
prior knowledge to make connections to the new materials throughout the process.” The 
instructors both viewed their role in the assessment process as facilitators rather than members of 
an inquisition. One instructor reflected that his role as facilitator was challenging on the point of 
always being consistent in the amount or type of prompts given during the assessment. Such 
inconsistency was noted as a concern for future practice. Both instructors stressed that modeling 
both an assessment practice and the teacher’s role in that assessment to preservice teachers were 
critical aspects underlying the performance task. 




815 838 



Phase I Conclusions 



Implementing a pedagogically-oriented performance assessment experience was found to 
be a rewarding experience for preservice teachers and instructors alike. Preservice teachers had 
the opportunity to articulate and demonstrate their thinking about teaching science as inquiry in a 
performance setting. Instructors were afforded an additional assessment strategy for evaluating 
their students and gained insights into the effectiveness of their own teaching through the 
students’ performances. Notably, the sharing of the rubric content and science topic ahead of 
time with the teachers was a critical factor in reducing stress associated with the performance task 
and helping teachers focus on pedagogical matters. 

Phase II 

The revisions during this phase of the study were influenced by the feedback from the 
preservice teachers (particularly the time constraint and topic anxiety) during Phase I and the 
views on performance assessment of Wiggins (1993). According to Wiggins, . . because the 
student is the primary client of all assessments, assessment should be designed to improve 
performance, not just monitor it” (p. 6, emphasis in original). Therefore, several fundamental 
changes were made during Phase II: Students were free to pick their own topic, students met with 
the instructor individually, and the scoring rubric was replaced by a revised rubric checklist. 

Sixty elementary education majors from two sections of a science methods course 
participated in the performance assessment near the end of the semester long course during the 
fall semester, 1996. The assignment description and revised rubric outline (see Table 2) were 
provided to the preservice teachers about two weeks before the performance assessment.

The scored weight of the assessment was the same as Phase I (10% of the final grade) but 
the scoring was not broken down into specific points. The students were informed that they were 
expected to address each issue on the rubric and if they did, they would receive full credit. 
Particular emphasis was given the “Journey in Progress” section of the assessment in order to 
encourage the students to reflect honestly on their progress toward inquiry teaching and see their 
growth more as a process rather than a fixed destination. 




817 



840 



Before the performance assessment, the students completed an “inquiry notes” form that 
contained the same categories as the rubric checklist. This afforded the instructors to be more 
actively involved with the assessment conversation rather than writing down the students’ 
responses and ideas. 

Phase II Findings 

Preservice Teacher Perspective 
Opportunity to Reflect 

“I was able to reflect on everything I've learned this semester and incorporate my beliefs 
and practices into that.” “I discovered that I am a learner.” “I was able to reflect on how I 
prepared my lesson. I was able to look at myself as a teacher and evaluate what I wanted students 
to understand and grasp in my lesson.” “It makes you think how you would assess students in 
hands on activities.” 

Articulate and Clarify Thoughts 

“I felt I was able to share my ideas and go into depth more about what I wished I could 
have done with my students.” “Made me think about different ways to experiment with this 
activity” “I saw things in a different way, one that made more sense than my original view.” 
Encouraged Discussion and Sharing 

“Talking through the topic helped me to understand the topic more clearly and it was 
good to hear feedback on my ideas.” “Very low stress but helpful.” “Discussion on ideas, 
positive feedback, one on one discussion and helpful insights. This was valuable to the learning 
process.” “Good experience to talk one on one with the professor.” 

Helpful Feedback 

“It allowed me to feel more confidence in my abilities.” “I feel I'm on the right track.” 




818 841 



“Encouraged me and challenged me. Gave me confidence to continue pursing the beliefs I have 
developed over the semester.” “It gave me an idea of where I was at now and where I can go 
with myself.” 

Affirmed Confidence to Teach Science 

“By discussing the inquiry process, I feel confident in myself that I can and will teach 
science in a constructivist approach.” “I was able to see growth in my abilities to teach science.” 
“I now know that I am capable of teaching science and have the foundation to do just that.” “It 
gave me confidence that I really can do it, be a teacher, and not all my ideas are wrong.” 

Instructor Perspective 

The one-on-one conversation format between a student and an instructor provided a 
relaxed atmosphere that seemed to invite a spontaneous sharing of ideas. There was an openness; 
a sense that both parties were learners and that all ideas were valuable. The assessment format 
also provided the opportunity for the instructors to affirm the students as teachers and how they 
might continue to move ahead. Lastly, the assessment informed the instructors’ practice and 
offered insights into the pedagogical ideas and educational needs of the students. 

Phase II Conclusions 

The revised performance assessment allowed the preservice teachers to discuss a familiar 
topic of their choice that they had implemented with elementary aged children. This revision 
helped reduce the overall anxiety of the preservice teachers and helped them prepare successfully 
for the assessment. Their confidence and depth of discussion were greater in comparison to the 
Phase I participants. The added section on the rubric addressing their journey created a positive 
format for honestly addressing issues, concerns, and dilemmas commonly encountered by teachers 
and teacher educators.

Discussion 



Performance assessment formats that encourage an exchange of ideas provide numerous 
benefits to preservice teachers and teacher educators alike. Preservice teachers are given helpful 
feedback in terms of their thoughts and actions regarding the teaching of science and inquiry. 
Teacher educators are provided feedback from their students that can inform their classroom 
practice. In order to move toward a performance assessment experience as envisioned by 
educators such as Wiggins, science teacher educators need to critically examine the forms of 
assessment currently practiced and seriously consider the student benefit over teacher 
convenience. Yet, several issues remain: Does removing a scoring system undermine the validity 
of such assessments? If levels of understanding are a part of the assessment, how are such levels 
measured? How can teacher educators build rapport with their students without sacrificing rigor 
on the part of the preservice teachers’ expectations and effort? Continued research is needed to 
address these important issues.

ORGANIZATION, IMPLEMENTATION, AND RESULTS OF AN 
EISENHOWER SYSTEMIC ELEMENTARY SCIENCE REFORM 
PROJECT 

Edward E. Jones, Miami University 



Most teachers and school administrators are familiar with Eisenhower funds that are used 
by schools to support science and mathematics inservice. These funds are available to school 
districts from state departments of education, usually on a per-pupil allocation. Another category 
of Eisenhower funds are available from the U.S. Department of Education through state agencies 
that govern higher education. Eisenhower grants are awarded on a competitive basis to colleges 
and universities across the United States. The objectives of Eisenhower Programs include (1) 
improve the science and mathematics skills of teachers; (2) improve the understanding of science 
and mathematics by students; (3) increase access of students to instruction in science and 
mathematics; and (4) promote cooperative programs among institutions of higher education, local 
education agencies, private industry, and nonprofit organizations; (5) attract female and minority 
students to the natural sciences, because they have traditionally shown a lesser level of interest in 
the natural sciences or in pursuing science and mathematics careers. 

The main purpose of this paper is to provide background information and describe a 
collaborative Eisenhower project that is bringing local systemic reform in elementary science to the 
Northwest Local School District (NLSD) of Cincinnati. This project is currently in the 16th of 19 
months. 



Over a decade ago, a sense of public urgency was aroused by the realization that enormous 
numbers of US citizens are scientifically and technologically illiterate (Johnston & Aldridge, 

1984). Science teaching as it is usually practiced, does not develop students' scientific literacy, 
higher reasoning ability, and the application skills necessary to benefit society (Cole, et al., 1991). 



Overview 



Background 




ERIC 



821 



Most elementary teachers do not like science and feel unprepared to do an adequate job of teaching 
science (Tilgner, 1990). 

Numerous studies have shown that an investigative and activity oriented approach to 
elementary science promotes intellectual development and the development of scientific literacy and 
"basic skills" such as reading, writing, and mathematics (Kotar, 1988; Kyle, 1988; Lloyd & 
Contreras, 1987). Students in hands-on elementary science programs become actively involved in 
direct experiences with the processes of science as they observe, compare, classify, measure, 
collect and interpret data, organize information, and draw inferences or conclusions. Under the 
supervision of a confident and well-prepared teacher, students attain a sound comprehension of 
science concepts and processes and develop positive attitudes toward science. However, many 
teachers are unsure of the purpose of hands-on activities or how to make them genuine learning 
experiences. 



Needs Assessments 

A needs assessment was conducted in the NLSD. Those responding were identified by 
their principals as leaders in elementary science instruction. The results indicated a high level of 
interest in "hands-on minds-on" science and other features proposed for the project. A summary 
of the needs assessment may be found in Appendix A. Additionally, in a separate needs 
assessment conducted by NLSD during 1994-95, two-thirds of those responding indicated a need 
for more assistance with physical sciences, one-third indicated a need for more assistance with 
biological sciences, and 41% indicated a need for more information regarding alternative 
assessment. During the spring, 1995, two science teachers were identified at each elementary 
building (one primary and one intermediate). They were interviewed and asked to describe the 
issues related to science instruction at the elementary level. These teachers overwhelmingly 
supported a hands-on approach to teaching science. They identified the lack of materials and lack 
of sufficient hands-on training as impediments to science instruction at the elementary level. These 
indicators and previous experience with hands-on inservice workshops guided the development of

the project; its objectives, design, content and methods; selection of teacher participants; and means 
of project evaluation. 



Project Objectives 
The objectives of this project are enumerated below. 

1 . Contribute to the development of a new grade K-5 elementary science curriculum emphasizing 
inquiry-based hands-on science; its integration with other subjects; and appropriate alternative 
assessment. 

2 . Improve competence of 72 NLSD and three administrators in science concepts, attitudes, 
processes and inquiry. 

3 . Develop increased confidence and eagerness of participants to teach science by inquiry 
emphasizing science concepts, processes, and attitudes. 

4. Establish regular inservice activities and activity-sharing by participants and project staff in the 
fall, 1996. 

5 . Contribute to a growing supportive network of excellent elementary science teachers in 
southwest Ohio. 

6 . Develop locations for meaningful elementary science field experiences and student teaching 
placements for elementary education majors. 

Beneficial Outcomes 

Program participants receive: (1) a three- week activity oriented workshop including hands- 
on inquiry activities and assistance in overcoming inherent difficulties teaching hands-on science 
(summer, 1996); (2) three day-long follow-up Saturday seminars during the fall, 1996 semester, to 
share ideas and successes and find moral support for implementation; (3) two classroom consulting 
visits by the project director or science coordinator during the 1996-97 school year; (4) eight 
semester hours of graduate credit with all tuition and fees waived; (5) workshop instructional 
materials; and (6) a stipend of $360 ($20/day for 18 days). Participating teachers agree to: (1) 
actively participate in all workshops and seminar sessions; (2) teach science on a regular basis, 



using a process-oriented, inquiry approach; and (3) work individually or with other participants to 
conduct at least two prescribed inservice activities. Participating schools receive: confident 
elementary teachers eager to teach science-by-inquiry and integrate science with other subjects; 
alternative assessment procedures; maximum student achievement in science and on science 
proficiency exams; major inservice activities; model classrooms for elementary science instruction; 
and administrators who are up-to-date regarding elementary science programs. 

Prior to student teaching, extensive in-school field experiences are required for preservice 
elementary education students in Ohio. The implementation of this proposal would assure effective 
field experiences and student teaching placements for many years for teacher education students 
who complete field work in the NLSD. Miami University (MU) will also benefit from a cadre of 
excellent K-5 science teachers for ongoing inservice activities of the MU Center for Mathematics 
and Science Education. 



District activities related to the project might be summarized as follows: 

1 . Organizing and limiting science topics to be taught at each grade level; 

2. Developing a curriculum and reviewing science materials; 

3. Selecting science materials to be piloted; 

4. Adopting and purchasing science materials; 

5. Encouraging teacher applications to become project participants; 

6. Sponsoring inservice activities for teachers who did not become participants. 

During 1995-96, the NLSD conducted an elementary science curriculum review and 
development process resulting in the adoption of a non-text inquiry-based program. They 
attempted to adopt a curriculum that would include all elements designated by the Ohio model 
science curriculum for effective elementary science teaching including inquiry experiences (Ohio 
Department of Education, 1994). Six major programs were considered including Science and 
Technology for Children (STC) published by Carolina Biological; Full Option Science System 
(FOSS) published by Britannica; SCIS 3 and other Delta Science Modules distributed by Delta

Education; Science Place published by Scholastic, Inc.; AIMS; and GEMS. The AIMS and GEMS 
materials were reviewed and found to be important as potential supplements to the units published 
by the other four companies listed above. None of the four major publishing companies offers a 
single hands-on program that would cover all of the units that were determined necessary for the 
NLSD grades K-5. Consequently, the adopted materials would not be exclusively from any one 
company. Materials eventually adopted included Seven units from STC, four from FOSS, 10 
from Science Place, one from SCIS-3, and one from Delta Science. 

The project includes 72 teachers and 3 administrators who attended a three-week summer 
workshop organized into three separate grade level groups, K-l, 2-3, and 4-5, with an average of 
25 participants in each group. Each grade level workshop included 15 days of formal instruction, 
laboratory and field experiences. Formal instruction (generally 9:00 a.m. to 12:00) covered 
physical, biological, and earth science concepts appropriate for the district's new science 
curriculum. During laboratory time (12:30 to 3:30 p.m.), participants worked in small groups with 
hands-on materials and learning centers to provide them with grade level activities that supported 
the adopted program. Laboratory time allowed teachers to carry out individual projects and 
undertake long-term activities and observations that would be used in their classrooms. Project 
workshops supported the revised curriculum and emphasized hands-on inquiry activities, selected 
science content, the integration of science with other subjects, and alternative hands-on 
assessment. Learning by inquiry included activities emphasizing a search for solutions rather than 
answers revealed directly by the teacher. Particular emphasis was placed on the processes of 
investigations. Teachers gained an operational knowledge of integrating investigative activities 
with mathematics, language arts, fiction and non-fiction trade books. 

Summer workshops were led by classroom teacher-leaders who worked with the same 
group for the entire three weeks and for the follow-up Saturday seminars. The teacher-leaders 
have had extensive success using investigative, hands-on approaches to science instruction and 
have previous experience instructing hands-on science projects for MU. They provided stability 
and methodology, working with teachers of their own grade level expertise. One of the professors 
is a botany professor providing expertise in biological science. The other is a professor of science

education providing expertise in the physical sciences and science education. The two professors 
rotated from one grade level group to another, spending time with each as their subject matter area 
is scheduled. 

A workshop follow-up includes inservice activities and classroom visits by the director and 
curriculum coordinator to assure the appropriate implementation of workshop activities and 
methods. Participants are observed teaching hands-on science in their classrooms, and they 
receive oral and written feedback. Observers offer suggestions on teaching methods, science 
content, materials management, learning centers, and displays. Three six-hour follow-up seminars 
are conducted during the 1996 fall semester by the project staff. These include instruction in 
science content and methodology, sharing ideas and experiences, and planning and conducting 
inservice activities. Workshops, seminars, inservice activities, and classroom observations are 
integrated for continuity. 

Inservice activities enable participants to share ideas and experiences with teachers who did 
not participate in the project by presenting at least two inservice programs each. Possible formats 
include regularly assisting another teacher in the building for one full semester; grade-level 
inservice for building or district; and inservice for buildings other than those of the participants. 
The district hosted a half-day science inservice for K-5 teachers, Friday, Nov. 1, 1996. All K-5 
teachers in the district and in selected Archdiocese schools were released to attend. 

Participant Selection 

Participants in this project were selected on the basis of demonstrated teaching competence 
and commitment to project objectives. Each applicant's principal must confirm instructional 
competence and assure that the teachers are provided with the necessary hands-on materials. 
Selection criteria included appropriate certification, grade level, history of honors, service to 
district committees, and demonstrated efforts for self-improvement. 

Teachers without previous experience with hands-on workshop opportunities but are eager 
to employ this approach in their classrooms were considered prime candidates. A special emphasis 
was placed on recruiting teachers from underrepresented and underserved groups and on teachers 



in schools with higher poverty level enrollments. Applicants from the same school who applied as 
a team were also given extra consideration in order to establish cooperative teams of teachers and 
administrators. An attempt was made to balance grade level representation. 

Each minority teacher in participating schools received a special personal invitation from the 
project director to apply, was encouraged to apply by school administrators, and was given extra 
consideration for selection. At least 10% of the participant positions were designated for minority 
groups. Minority participants were sought from Archdiocese schools outside of the target schools 
to assure this level of U/U participation. 



Evaluation 

Prior to the start of the workshops, participants were given a pretest to assess their level of 
comfort with teaching science, attitudes toward science and science teaching, and subject matter 
competence. Similar assessments were given at the end of the summer workshop and will be 
given again at the end of the final Saturday seminar. It was expected that participants would 
demonstrate significant cognitive and affective gains between the pre and posttest and maintain 
these gains as indicated on post-posttests. At the end of the first week of the summer workshop, 
participants completed anonymous formative evaluations of the workshop expressing opinions of 
each aspect of the workshop and suggestions for improvement. They provided an anonymous 
summative evaluations of the workshop at the end of the t hir d week and will again at the end of the 
project. They were asked their opinions of the project; level of interest in continued use of hands- 
on science; level of enthusiasm for continued inservice work; and willingness to serve as a 
resource for pre-service elementary education majors. A random sample of participants are being 
interviewed by the evaluator for an in-depth qualitative evaluation. Throughout the project, all 
tests, and evaluations were developed, administered, and analyzed with the consultation of the 
project evaluator who was responsible for project research design and statistical analysis of data. 
Classroom observations confirm the level of effective implementation of workshop activities and 
philosophy. A written assessment of teaching effectiveness for each participant is being collected 
and analyzed. 



Results of Cognitive and Affective Testing 



The project includes pre, post, and post-posttesting of cognitive and affective factors, but 
post-posttests have yet to be administered. The results thus far are reported in this paper. The 
pretests were administered on the first day of the three-week summer workshop, and posttests 
were given on the last workshop day. Post-posttests will be taken by participants near the end of 
the current semester. 

Cognitive Analysis 

Knowledge of selected science concepts and science teaching practices were assessed using 
a 25 item multiple choice test prepared by the project Director and workshop instructors. Each item 
had five possible responses. Items included basic concepts from biology, physical science, 
environmental science, earth science, and science methodology. 

Total cognitive test scores were determined for each of the three groups and for two 
periods. The means and standard deviations for each period are reported in Table 1. The 
dependent cognitive variable was analyzed using a two way repeated measures analysis of variance 
with grade grouping representing one factor (three levels K-l, 2-3, and 4-5) and time of testing 
representing the repeated measures factor (pre and post tests). Analysis results are reported in 
Table 2. There was no test-period-by-group interaction, so any difference indicated could be 
generalized to all three grade level groups. The F-ratio associated with grade grouping was barely 
significant (F=3.16, p<.05) because teachers at the 4-5 levels scored higher than teachers at the K- 
1 levels. The time of testing factor defined a significant F-ratio (F=88.64, p<.05), indicating that 
the two time periods differed significantly on the cognitive variable.

Affective Analysis 

Attitudes toward science and science teaching were assessed using a modified version of 
the "Scientific Attitude Inventory" (Moore, 1973). The original inventory consisted of 70 
statements to which subjects are asked to respond on a four point Likert scale from "strongly 
agree" to "strongly disagree." For use with this project, the inventory was shortened to 27 items 
by eliminating some "duplicate" items and items statistically shown not to contribute to 
differentiation between test periods for this project. On the response scanner form "strongly agree" 
= 0 and "strongly disagree" = 3. For about half the items the preferred response was "strongly 
agree" (0). For the rest the preferred response was "strongly disagree" (3). For statistical analysis 
the numerical value of the responses was "reflected," so that all preferred responses were read as 
three. Within the 27 items on the attitude inventory, two main factors were identified. The first 
factor was identified as "attitude toward the understanding and teaching of science." Thirteen items 
could be identified with the first factor. The second factor was identified as "attitude toward the 
philosophy of science." Fourteen items were identified with the second factor. Analysis of each 
factor may be found below. 

Analysis of Attitude toward the Understanding and Teaching of Science 

Average attitude scores regarding the understanding and teaching of science were 
determined for each participant for pre-workshop and post-workshop periods. The means and 
standard deviations by period are reported in Table 3. Participants started with somewhat positive 
attitudes as may be noted by their mean pretest scores. The scores by period were analyzed with a 
two-way repeated measures analysis of variance as shown in Table 4. The significant period effect 
suggested significant differences over time (F=26.96, p<.05). There was no difference between

grade level groups. There was no time-by-grade level interaction, so the difference could be 
generalized to all three groups.

Average attitude scores regarding the philosophy of science were determined for each 
participant for pre-workshop and post-workshop periods. The means and standard deviations by 
period are reported in Table 5. Participants started with somewhat positive attitudes as may be 
noted by their mean pretest scores. The scores by period were analyzed with a two-way repeated

significant differences over time (F=18.38, p<.05). There was a small difference between grade 
level groups (F=3.29, p<.05) but no time-by-grade level interaction.

Summary 

Testing appears to indicate that project objectives related to the improvement of science 
understanding and attitudes toward science are being met. Cognitive test scores for each group 
improved significantly from pretest to posttest. Affective testing indicate significant improvement 
of attitudes toward science, science teaching, and the philosophy of science. The design and 
implementation of this project appears to have contributed significantly to the cognitive gains of 
participants and to their attitudes toward science and science teaching, and the philosophy of 
science. Casual observation suggests that affective scores improve in a manner similar to the 
improvement of cognitive scores. 

One significant casual observation has been that participants had much less difficulty 
adapting to the procedures and methods of hands-on science than to some basic generic teaching 
expectations. During summer workshops and academic year seminars, project faculty emphasized 



O 




831 



and regularly modeled how to get students involved at higher cognitive levels and how to use 
effective questioning skills. Still, many participants have difficulty demonstrating these skills in 
their own classrooms. In many cases it seems that participants have never mastered skills such as 
planning, introducing and concluding a lesson, and higher level questioning techniques. 

Other objectives of the project seem to be meeting with success. Project Director visits to 
have provided a wide array of inservice activities within and outside the district. All have provided 
at least two inservice activities within the district. A few have submitted proposals for state and 
local conference presentations. A growing network is linking participants of this project with 
participants in other southwestern Ohio hands-on science projects. They have opportunities to 
share ideas and provide moral support through regional conferences and newsletters. At the very 
least, hands-on minds-on science has taken root in southwestern Ohio. 

Eisenhower Funding for this and Similar projects 

The major source of Eisenhower funds for all 50 states is the U.S. Department of 
Education. Federal funds are allocated to each state department of education and to each state 
board of regents. Funding for the project described herein includes $42,648 from the Ohio Board 
of Regents Eisenhower Program. Eisenhower funds are supporting teacher-leader salaries and 
participant stipends. Teachers are receiving eight semester hours of credit with fees waived by 
Miami University. Costsharing by Miami University includes $70,000 for staff salaries, travel, 
workshop materials, and office expenses. School districts' costsharing of $166,000 includes the 
cost of adopted hands-on science materials and in-kind support for administration and inservice 
sessions. 

Funds from college and university Eisenhower Project are not available directly to schools 
or teachers. Any local education agency interested in participation in a viable project could 
approach a nearby college or university to determine if they would be interested in developing and 
participating in such an effort. It would be prudent to approach science or mathematics educators 
in departments of education, mathematics, or natural sciences. If a good match is made, another 




832 



collaborative effort between higher education and one or more local education agencies funded by 
the Eisenhower Program may well be realized.

USING EXPERT OPINION TO GUIDE ITEM SELECTION FOR AN 
INSTRUMENT TO MEASURE 5TH-GRADE STUDENTS’ 
UNDERSTANDING OF THE NATURE OF SCIENTIFIC 
KNOWLEDGE 

Michael A. Hughes Emory University ATLANTA GA. 

Abstract 

This paper describes the methodology and presents the findings of a study done to select 
items for inclusion in an instrument to measure 5th-grade students’ understanding of the nature of 
scientific knowledge. One hundred sixteen scientists and 38 science educators responded to a 
Likert survey in which they were asked to rate the: (a) accuracy and importance of eight 
propositional statements that form the model of scientific knowledge on which the instrument is 
based; and (b) the truth or falsity of 64 potential item statements. The data suggest that: (a) the 
eight propositions are all accurate and important statements about the nature of scientific 
knowledge; and (b) that there is consensus as to the truth or falsity of 45 item statements. 

The data were also examined for evidence of differences in the perception of the nature of 
scientific knowledge among science educators and (a) scientists, (b) scientists grouped by working 
environment — agency, industry, or university; and (c) scientists grouped by discipline. The 
analysis revealed some potentially interesting, statistically significant, between-groups differences. 
However, these differences, as might be expected given the simplicity of the model of scientific 
knowledge used, were modest. 

Scientific Literacy 

A number of recent efforts have sought to redefine and create new standards for science 
education. Three of the most prominent were the National Science Education Standards from the 
National Research Council (NRC), Project 2061 from the American Association for the 
Advancement of Science (AAAS), and Scope. Sequence, and Coordination of Secondary School 
Science from the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA). Common to these reform efforts 
was the identification of the need to: (a) enhance the scientific literacy of all Americans as the goal 
of K-12 science education; and (b) promote inquiry based, hands-on teaching of science as a

crucial pathway to scientific literacy (AAAS, 1989; NRC, 1996; National Science Board, 1983). 

Over the years, the NRC (1988, 1996), the NSTA (1992), the AAAS (1993), and a host of 
individuals have offered definitions of the term scientific literacy and/or discussed what 
characterizes a scientifically literate person. Analysis of the many definitions reveals five 
dominant, recurring attributes of the scientifically literate individual. These attributes are: (a) a 
realistic understanding of the nature of scientific knowledge and the scientific process; (b) 
possession of a range of skills identified with the process of scientific inquiry; (c) familiarity with 
a knowledge base that includes the fundamental concepts and theories of science; (d) an 
understanding of the inter-relationships between science, technology, and society; and (e) the 
ability to apply the preceding four attributes to one's personal, civic, and work lives. 

The Nature of Scientific Knowledge 

Citing references as early as 1959, Kimball (1968) noted that “one of the most commonly 
stated objectives for science education is the attainment of an understanding of the nature of 
science” (p. 110). In 1982, the NSTA emphasized the development of students’ understanding of 
the nature of the scientific process and scientific knowledge as crucial tasks for science educators. 
Lederman and O’Malley (1990) reported that understanding the nature of science had been a 
“perennial objective” (p. 225) of science education for thirty years. Meichtry (1992) identified 
understanding the nature of science as a critical component of scientific literacy and reported in 
1993 that the literature had been consistent in identifying an understanding of the nature of science 
and scientific knowledge as key components of scientific literacy. In 1995, Shamos stated that 
understanding the nature of scientific knowledge is a vital part of scientific literacy, a position 
reiterated by the NRC in 1996. 

Nature of Science versus Nature of Scientific Knowledge 

Meichtry (1 993) reported that the nature of science and the nature of scientific knowledge 
have been used interchangeably in the literature. Meichtry warned, however, that there are 
distinctions “that merit discussion” (p. 430). According to Meichtry, the nature of science is a 
broad concept that includes the nature of scientific knowledge, the scientific enterprise, and 
scientists themselves. In the current study, it is argued that to understand the nature of scientific 
knowledge one must understand the scientific process and the scientific enterprise. Meichtry said 
that the “definitions for both the nature of science and scientific knowledge presented in the 
literature are multifaceted” (p. 432) and cautioned that there is no “standardized definition” (p. 432) 




837 



860 



for either term. 

Importance 

Cotham and Smith (1981) offered an explanation of why it is important to understand the 
nature of science. They stated that for people who do not understand the tentative and 
developmental nature of scientific knowledge, cynicism is a frequent and reasonable reaction when 
faced with new scientific observations and/or theories that contradict accepted positions. Duschl 
(1990) warned that science may be seen as irrational by those who do not understand the nature of 
scientific knowledge and who are, therefore, unable to accept reformulations of scientific ideas. 
The AAAS (1993) and the NRC (1996) said that understanding the nature of scientific knowledge 
has a direct impact on individuals’ ability to make informed choices on the environment, health, 
and other science related issues that effect their civic, political, and personal lives. 

Shamos (1995) argued that the understanding of the nature of scientific knowledge is 
important in itself, and vital if students are to retain scientific concepts taught as part of the content 
dimension of scientific literacy. Shamos, in cautioning against expecting the average citizen to be 
able to participate in a meaningful way in the discussion of science related issues, argued that 
society should expect individuals to be able to assess, and then accept or reject the opinions and/or 
positions of experts. Shamos did not explicitly make the point, but it is reasonable to assume that 
an understanding of the nature of scientific knowledge is necessary if one is to evaluate the 
statements of experts on science related issues. 

Definition 

In a 1997 study, Alters turned to philosophers of science as the highest authority on the 
nature of science. Based on his survey of a random sample of members of the Philosophy of 
Science Association who held the rank of assistant professor or higher at American universities, 
Alters reported that the philosophers varied on their views of the nature of science. This study 
illustrates that, even among experts, there is disagreement about the true nature of science. 

Numerous studies have documented differing perceptions of the nature of science among 
philosophers of science, scientists, science education professors, and K-12 science teachers (Atler, 
1997; Cleminson, 1990; Pomeroy, 1993). In pursuing the task of developing an instrument to 
measure 5th-graders’ understanding of the nature of science, the title to Alter’s 1997 paper is 
cogent: “Whose nature of science?” Atler reported that those he considered the most expert, the 
philosophers of science, differed with the tenets on the nature of scientific knowledge advanced by 




838 



the AAAS, the NRC, and the NSTA in defining the current science reform movement. Despite 
Atler’s implied criticism of their view of the nature of science, the AAAS’ Science for all 
Americans (SFA) and Benchmarks for Scientific Literacy (BSL), and the NRC’s National Science 
Education Standards (NSES) are the seminal documents of the science reform movement. In 
developing an instrument for use with 5th-graders, the decision was made to examine what these 
publications say about the nature of science. 

Rutherford and Ahlgren (1990) stated that SFA “represents the informed thinking of the 
scientific community as nearly as such a thing can be ascertained” (p. xv). SFA begins its 
discussion of the nature of science with the statement that “Scientists share certain basic beliefs and 
attitudes about what they do and how they view their work” (p. 1). Throughout the discussion of 
the nature of science, SFA refers to what scientists do and what scientists believe. 

The preface to BSL stated that “an unprecedented number of elementary-, middle-, and 
high school teachers, school administrators, scientists, mathematicians, engineers, historians, and 
learning specialists participated in the development of Benchmarks and its nationwide critique” (p. 
vii). BSL further claimed to be based on the “solid findings” (p. xiii) of the research on students’ 
understanding and learning. In discussing the nature of science, BSL consistently refers to the 
practice and beliefs of scientists. 

The NSES stated that “teachers; science supervisors; curriculum developers; publishers; 
those who work at museums, zoos and science centers; science educators; scientists and 
engineers across the nation; school board members; parents; members of business and industry; 
and legislators and other public officials.. .were involved in the development of the National 
Science Education Standards ” (p. ix). The NSES, like SFA and BSL, discuss the nature of 
science in terms of the practice and beliefs of scientists. 

Note is made that the literature includes criticism of scientists’ qualifications to define the 
nature of scientific knowledge. Pitt (1990) and Shapiro (1994) are among those who have written 
that working scientists have incomplete understanding of the nature of science. Despite this 
criticism, given the unanimous operational definition of the nature of science in terms of the 
practice and beliefs of scientists in the defining documents of the science reform movement, the 
decision was made to turn to scientists in establishing the content validity of the instrument to 
measure 5th-graders’ understanding of the nature of scientific knowledge. To accommodate the 
criticism of scientists as experts on the nature of science, university based science educators were 




839 



included in the content validation sample. 

Student Understanding 

Meichtry (1993) reported Rubba’s 1977 disclosure that large numbers of students do not 
understand the nature of scientific knowledge. This finding echoed results published by Cooley 
and Klopfer (1963), Kimball (1968), Korth (1969), and Aikenhead (1973), in addition to 
Meichtry’s (1993) own conclusion that there is widespread misunderstanding of the nature of 
science by students at all levels. 

Models 

In 1968, Kimball proposed a model of scientific knowledge based on eight declarations. 
These declarations were that science: (a) is driven by curiosity; (b) is dynamic and ongoing; 

(c) strives for comprehensiveness and simplicity; (d) has no single methodology; (e) is a system 
of values rather than an armamentarium of techniques; (f) is based on the assumption that the 
physical universe can, in principle at least, be described and explained; (g) is open to scrutiny; 
and (h) is tentative and uncertain. Showalter (1974) identified nine attributes of scientific 
knowledge. Scientific knowledge, he said, is: (a) tentative; (b) public; (c) replicative; 

(d) probabilistic; (e) humanistic; (f) historic; (g) unique; (h) holistic; and (i) empirical. Rubba 
and Andersen (1978) consolidated Showalter’s nine factors into a six factor model, stating that 
scientific knowledge is: (a) amoral; (b) creative; (c) developmental; (d) parsimonious; (e) 
testable; and (f) unified. In 1981, Cotham and Smith characterized scientific knowledge as 
tentative and revisionary. Lederman and O’Malley (1990) combined the definitions of Rubba and 
Andersen and Cotham and Smith. They replaced Rubba and Andersen’s developmental 
proposition with Cotham and Smith’s idea that scientific knowledge is tentative and revisionary, 
and retained Rubba and Andersen’s other five propositions. In revising Rubba and Andersen’s 
(1978) measure of understanding of the nature of scientific knowledge, Meichtry operationalized 
the definition in 1992 by retaining the propositions that scientific knowledge is. (a) creative; 

(b) developmental; (c) testable; and (e) unified. Meichtry dropped the propositions that scientific 
knowledge is amoral and parsimonious, and made a limited number of changes to the item 
statements used. Meichtry did not, however, provide an account of the validation of the modified 
model for use with middle school students. 

Validity 

Validity refers to “the appropriateness, meaningfulness, and usefulness of the specific 




840 



inferences made from test scores” (p.9, American Educational Research Association, American 
Psychological Association, National Council on Measurement in Education, (AERA/APA/NCME) 
1985). That is, the inferences made from test results, not the test itself, are subject to validation. 

Three categories of validity evidence have traditionally been considered. These categories 
are known as: (a) content validity; (b) criterion validity; and (c) construct validity. More recently, 
consequential validity has emerged as a new category. 

Content Validity 

Content validity refers to the extent to which the particular items included in a given test are 
“representative of some defined universe or domain of content” (p. 10, AERA/APA/NCME, 1985). 
Evidence supporting the content validity of inference based on the results of a given test often rely 
on the judgment of experts as to whether the test items fit the construct being tested. The 
AERA/APA/NCME advises that evidence of content related validity should be a central concern 
during test development and that “expert professional judgment should play an integral part in 
developing the definition of what is to be measured, ... generating or selecting the content sample, 
and specifying the item format and scoring system” (p. 11). The primary purpose of this study 
was to use expert judgment to guide the selection of items to be included in a test. Note is made 
that the reasons for considering the participants as experts with respect to the content domain are 
described. 

Criterion Validity 

Criterion related evidence shows that test results are systematically related to some specific 
concurrent or future outcome (AERA/APA/NCME, 1985; Thorndike, Cunningham, Thorndike, & 
Hagen, 1991) The concurrent or future outcome of interest is the criterion. A high correlation 
between test scores and the criterion is evidence of the validity of inferring criterion performance 
based on scores on the given test. Thorndike et al. identified, in order of importance, four qualities 
desired in a criterion measure. These qualities were: (a) relevance; (b) freedom from bias; (c) 
reliability; and (d) availability. This study did not address criterion validity issues. 

Construct Validity 

Construct-related evidence of validity focuses on the question of whether the test results are 
in fact a true measure of the construct being assessed (AERA/APA/NCME, 1985). The AERA/ 
APA/NCME stressed that construct of interest must be embedded in a conceptual framework, even 
if this framework is incomplete, that “specifies the construct, distinguishes it from other 




841 



constructs, and indicates how measures of the construct should relate to other variables” (p.9). 
These organizations recommended that issues such as language level, test format, and 
administration conditions be given careful attention when considering the construct validity of 
inferences. They suggested that: (a) inter correlations among items can provide evidence that a 
single construct was measured; (b) substantial relationships to other measures of the same 
construct and weak relationships to measures of different constructs support specification of the 
given construct; and (c) interviews with test takers to explore why they responded to given items 
in particular ways “can yield hypotheses that enrich the definition of a construct” (p. 10). Finally, 
the AERA/APA/NCME noted that evidence of the content and criterion related validity of 
inferences support the construct validity of these inferences. This study did provide evidence that 
will contribute to establishing the content validity of inferences drawn from data derived from the 
use of the instrument by: (a) locating the construct of interest— understanding of the nature of 
scientific knowledge— within a framework provided by a review of the literature; (b) describing the 
procedures used for test and item formatting; and (c) recounting the steps taken to determine the 
suitability of the test language for the intended test users. 

Consequential Validity 

Nettles and Nettles (1995) defined consequential validity as the “extent to which an 
assessment tool and the wavs in which it is used produce positive consequences— for the teaching 
and learning process, and for students who may experience different educational opportunities as a 
result of test based placement” (p. 95). These authors elaborated on the definition of consequential 
validity in arguing that tests that are free of bias in a “technical sense” (p. 121) can be considered 
unfair, in terms of consequential validity, if part of the gap in scores between different groups can 
be ascribed to class, race, or gender bias. Nettles and Nettles defined instructional effects as 
changes in the degree to which teachers devote time to classroom activities that: (a) promote 
valuable learning; and (b) are responsible to individual student needs. They then said that 
evidence for the consequential validity of inferences focuses on desired instructional effects. This 
study did not address the issue of consequential validity. 

Pu rpo se 

The study was designed to answer two questions: (a) Which of the propositional 
statements are judged by scientists and science educators to be accurate and important statements 
about the nature of scientific knowledge? and (b) For which item statements is there agreement 



0 

ERIC 



842 



865 



among scientists and science educators as to the truth or falsity of the statement? Note is made that 
the questions were posed in terms of what is intellectually honest, yet appropriate for 5th-grade 
students. The rating of a propositional statement as accurate and important by the survey 
participants will be considered as support for including the proposition in a model of the nature of 
scientific knowledge being used to guide development of an instrument to measure this construct. 
Consensus among the respondents as to the truth or falsity of an item statement will be interpreted 
as evidence that supports inclusion of the item in the instrument. 

The model of scientific knowledge was created by retaining Rubba and Andersen’s (1978) 
six propositions and adding two new propositions. The additions state that scientific knowledge 
is: (a) relevant in many fields and/or endeavors; and (b) reflects the contributions of many diverse 
individuals. These propositions were added because of the emphasis placed on them by the AAAS 
in 1989, and again in 1993. Rubba and Andersen’s developmental proposition was retained, 
instead of Cotham and Smith’s (1981) tentative and revisionary propositions. The developmental 
proposition was judged adequate for a model aimed at 5th-grade students, a position supported by 
Meichtry’s use of the developmental proposition in 1992. Each propositional statement was 
operationalized by eight item statements. 

Importance 

As the academy of science educators promotes an inquiry based, hands-on pedagogy as 
vital to developing the scientific literacy of all students (National Research Council, 1996; 
American Association for the Advancement of Science, 1993), others, warned the National Science 
Teachers Association (1992), call for a return to traditional methods that stress the memorization of 
facts. Empirical data on the effectiveness of hands-on inquiry based pedagogy at increasing upper 
elementary students’ understanding of the nature of scientific knowledge will be important and 
useful in informing the policy decisions of school systems as they grapple with, (a) science 
curriculum reform; and (b) the allocation of limited resources. Data will also be valuable to the 
science education professorate as it participates in the education of teachers. As Shamos noted in 
1995, if curricula are to be developed to promote scientific literacy, “one must have an accurate 
means of testing the end product” (p. 81). There is, however, no instrument available that has 
been shown to be the basis for valid inferences about the understanding of the nature of scientific 
knowledge of students below the high school level. The results of this study will be used in the 
development and validation of an instrument to measure this construct for students at the 5th-grade 




843 



level. 



Preliminary Steps 



The main methodological component of this study was a survey of experts — scientists and 
science educators — to determine their responses to a series of propositions and statements about 
the nature of scientific knowledge. Several preliminary steps were conducted. Each of these steps 
is presented below. In the interest of continuity, the method, results, and conclusions of each 
piece are presented as a unit. 

Plausibility Study 

Two 5th- and two 6th-grade students were interviewed to determine whether students of 
this age are likely to possess the conceptual knowledge necessary for a Likert-type scale to be a 
meaningful measure of young students’ understanding of the nature of science. (Though not ideal, 
the use of sixth grade students reflects the difficulty of obtaining permission to interview students 
in school settings). The interviews addressed the hypothesis that all upper elementary students’ 
understanding of the nature of scientific knowledge might be uniformly low, and therefore produce 
scores of such restricted range that discrimination between different levels of understanding is not 



The interviews were conducted away from school with the researcher’s daughter, a female 
friend of his daughter, and two neighborhood boys. Each interviewee was asked a series of 
questions about the eight propositional statements. Follow up questions were asked to determine if 
the young person: (a) understood the questions being asked; (b) understood the concept being 
explored; and (c) could give an appropriate example/elaboration/explanation of the concept. Each 
interview was taped and three were transcribed verbatim. Each statement in the transcribed 
interviews was coded to indicate whether or not the young person met the three criteria described 
above. 

The results were encouraging. Each interviewee appeared to understand the questions and 
to have reasonably accurate conceptions of the nature of science. The concept of morality was an 
exception. All interviewees had problems with this concept, and three were unable to distinguish 
between deliberately and accidentally harming another person. The proposition addressing the 
amoral nature of scientific knowledge was retained pending results of subsequent steps in the 
validation process.

Initial Items 

Edward’s (1957) and Spector’s (1992) advice was followed in the writing of statements 
for each proposition. Five experts (three professors of the philosophy of science, one professor of 
the history of science, and one science education professor) were interviewed independently, and 
asked to state their opinions as to the validity of the model of the nature of scientific knowledge 
derived from the eight propositions. The experts were also asked to respond to, and make 
suggestions about, the preliminary item statements. Insight gained from the interviews was used 
to write eight statements for each proposition. 

Suitability Study 

The proposed statements were reviewed by an elementary reading specialist, and her 
suggestions were used to rewrite several items. The statements were compiled into a 
questionnaire, and sent to 50 5th-grade teachers in a variety of urban and suburban schools. 
Participants were asked to rate the suitability of 64 potential item statements for use with 5th-grade 
students using a six point scale. On this scale, 1 meant that under 55%, 6 that over 95%, of 5th- 
graders would be able to read and understand a given item. Participants were also asked to circle 
problem words and/or phrases and to suggest alternatives. 

Nineteen teachers responded to the survey. Items with a mean score less than 5.0 (5 
equaled 86% to 95% of 5th-graders able to read and understand the statement) were judged to be 
unacceptable. Twenty-nine such statements were identified. Problem words and phrases were 
tabulated. 

A second reading specialist reviewed the survey results, and her suggestions were used in 
rewriting problem statements. The reworded items were resubmitted to the 19 original teacher 
respondents. The instructions were changed to state that the test administrator would read the 
statements aloud during administration of the instrument. Fourteen teachers responded to the 
resurvey. Four of the rewritten items produced mean scores below the target of 5.0. Three of the 
four problem items probed the morality/ immorality of the ways scientific knowledge is developed 
and/or applied compared to the knowledge itself. Two of these statements were reworded to 
replace the words moral and/or immoral with the phrase “harm people, animals, or the 
environment,” a phrase that had been judged acceptable in other statements. Two problem 
items — (a) the things scientists do to learn new knowledge should not be judged by whether these 
things hurt people, animals or the environment; and (b) given the choice between two explanations 




845 



for a natural event, scientists will choose the more complicated one — were retained unchanged. 

The decision to retain or eliminate these two items was postponed until more data are available 
from future steps in the validation process. 

Preliminary Expert Survey 

The preliminary expert survey was conducted as a test of the proposition and item 
statements. Surveys, with an explanatory cover letter and a stamped, return envelope were placed 
in the mailboxes of science professors at three local universities and one local college. The 
husband of one of the researcher’s M.Ed. students distributed surveys to fellow scientists at his 
work place, a unit of the National Institutes of Health. The secretary of the science education 
department at a nearby university, contacted by phone, distributed surveys to science education 
faculty. Twenty-five university scientists, ten agency scientists, and six professors of science 
education responded. 

The scale provided for responding to the proposition statements (1 equaled accurate and 
important; 2 equaled accurate and moderately important; 3 equaled accurate but unimportant; and 
4 equaled inaccurate and/or misleading) was judged to be invalid because of confounding of 
accuracy and importance and was changed in the main survey. Despite this problem, a low mean 
score was interpreted as an indication that experts were reacting favorably to a propositional 
statement whereas a high mean score indicated an unfavorable response. Based on this 
interpretation, the propositions that scientific knowledge is amoral, parsimonious, and unified were 
problematic. 

Of 64 items statements tested, the responses of the first 3 1 participants indicated that 50 
items met the consensus criterion of a mean item score in the ranges 1 .0 to 2.5 or 6.5 to 8.0 on a 
scale on which 1 equaled definitely true, and 8 equaled definitely false. Based on the responses of 
these participants, 12 new statements were added as alternatives to the problem items. With 10 
scientists responding to the alternates, six of the new items met the consensus criteria. The 
preliminary survey, therefore, identified a total of 46 items for which there appeared to be 
consensus among scientists as to the truth or falsity of the items. 

Method 

Based on the results of the preliminary study, 1 6 items were either rewritten or reworded 
and added to the 47 that had met the consensus criteria established for the preliminary study. Two 
items which had narrowly missed the consensus criteria were retained unchanged. Note that the 





846 



eight propositions are numbered 1-8, and the 64 item statements are numbered 9-72. 

Recruiting Participants 

The study was designed to survey scientists working in three environments — universities, 
agencies, and industry — and science education faculty. National Institutes of Health (NIH) 
Laboratories and National Laboratories were contacted by telephone, the study explained, and 
permission was sought to submit the survey, either electronically or by hard copy, to scientists at 
the particular institution. A directory of research and technology was used to identify Georgia and 
national companies that employ doctoral level persons in research and development. As with the 
agencies, these businesses were contacted by telephone, the study explained, and permission was 
sought to submit the survey to the scientists. Whether sent by mail or electronically, the survey 
packet included a cover letter explaining the study, a letter of support from the researcher’s major 
professor, and the survey itself. 

To recruit university scientists and science educators, the physics, chemistry, biology/ 
biological science, geology/geological sciences and science education departments of large 
universities were contacted by phone and asked to either provide the e-mail address of the faculty 
and post-doctorates, or to identify one person who would agree to receive the survey packet 
electronically and then distribute it within the department. 

To increase the participation of science educators, the survey packet was distributed at the 
1996 conference of the Southeastern Association of Educators of Teachers in Science (SAETS). A 
follow-up message was posted to the SAETS list server encouraging members to complete the 
survey, or to contact the researcher to receive the survey electronically. The survey packet was 
also distributed electronically on the list server of the Association of Educators of Teachers in 
Science, and forwarded to the list server of the National Association of Research in Science 
Teaching (NARST). An e-mail message briefly describing the study and stating the problem of the 
small number of responses from science educators was sent to NARST members listed in the 1995 
directory with an address that included a reference to an education department, and for whom an e- 
mail address was given. The message asked recipients to respond if they were willing to 
participate in the study. The survey packet was sent to those who signaled their willingness to 
participate. 

Proposition Statements 

Respondents were asked to respond to the eight propositions by indicating their agreement 




847 



870 



or disagreement that each is an: (a) accurate; and (b) important statement about the nature of 
scientific knowledge. A six point scale was used for both constructs (accuracy and importance). 
On this scale, 1 equaled strongly agree, 2 equaled agree, 3 equaled weakly agree, 4 equaled weakly 
disagree, 5 equaled disagree, and 6 equaled strongly disagree that the statement is accurate/ 
important. Participants were asked to think in terms of what is intellectually honest, but 
appropriate for 5th graders; that is, children ages 10 and 11. Mean scores for accuracy and 
importance were calculated. To be retained in the model, a mean accuracy score and a mean 
importance score of less than 3.0 were prescribed. 

Item Statements 

Participants used an eight point scale to voice their opinion as to the truth or falsity of each 
item. On this scale, 1 equaled definitely true, 2 equaled true, 3 equaled mostly true, 4 equaled 
more true than false, 5 equaled more false than true, 6 equaled mostly false, 7 equaled false, and 8 
equaled definitely false. Participants were instructed to: (a) think in terms of what is intellectually 
honest, but appropriate for 5th grade students; (b) distinguish between the methods used to 
generate scientific knowledge, scientific knowledge itself, and the application of this knowledge; 
(c) interpret "test" in a broad sense to include both direct and indirect methods; and (d) distinguish 
between observations and interpretations. 

The first step in the process of identifying items for which there was expert consensus was 
an examination of plots of the frequency distributions, expressed as percentages, for each item. 
Each graph was rated A, B, C or F. This rating was done with each item identified by number 
only. The following rubric was used to rate the graphs. To be rated A, the graph had: (a) all 
responses falling in either the 1,2, and 3 (true) or 8, 7, and 6 categories (false); and (b) a 
maximum at 1 (true) or 8 (false), and a minimum at 3 (true) or 6 (false). B graphs had: (a) a 
maximum at 1 or 2 (true), or 8 or 7 (false); (b) less than 10% of responses at the 5 plus 6 marks 
(true) or 4 plus 3 marks (false); and (c) no response at 7 or 8 (true) or 1 or 2 (false). Graphs 
rated C did not meet the criteria for A or B graphs but did show evidence that a majority of 
respondents agree to the truth or falsity of the item. Graphs that did not meet the criteria to be rated 
A, B, or C were designated F. The mean response scores were calculated in the second step of 
identifying items for which there was consensus. 

The best items were identified as those which had been given an A rating for the frequency 
distribution graph and had a mean response score of less than 2.0 or greater than 7.0. Statements 



ERIC 



848 



with mean scores less than 2.5 or greater than 6.5 with a frequency distribution rated as B or 
higher were designated better items Items rated C or higher and with mean score less than 2.7 or 
greater than 6.3 were deemed good items. Those items that were either not given at least a C rating 
or which had a mean score between 2.7 and 6.3 were judged to not meet the prescribed standard 
for content validity. 

Follow-Up Study 

Because a Likert scale survey provides no insight into why participants responded in a 
given way, a follow-up study was conducted to probe items that produced polarized responses; 
that is, items for which the frequency distribution for response was U-shaped or flat. Three items, 
two from the testable proposition and one from the creative proposition have been included in the 
follow-up study to date. The testability statements were items 1 1 and 38. Item 1 1 stated that all 
scientific knowledge can be tested; item 38 said that some scientific knowledge can never be 
tested. The creative item asserted that scientific explanations are discovered in nature, not created 
by scientists. Participants who had responded to these items with l’s and 2’s, or 8’s and 7’s, 
were contacted by e-mail, informed of the polar responses to the item, and invited to explain their 
response. Participants were told that the opposing viewpoints would be distributed anonymously 
to the other respondents. Participants were informed that they would again be invited to respond. 

The first round of responses to the testable/not testable and created/discovered issues have 
been received, analyzed, and incorporated into this study. First round responses have been sent to 
participants. Reactions to these summaries are being received, but these data are incomplete and 
are not included in the study as reported at this time. 

Group Differences 

The second purpose of this study was to explore differences in the nature of scientific 
knowledge as seen by: (a) scientists and science educators; and (b) scientists from different 
environments — agency, industry, or university — and science educators, (c) scientists from 
different disciplines and science educators. Note that the term science educator is used to describe 
university based professors of education who specialize in science education; university scientists, 
also professors, are classified as scientists. When analysis was performed to look for these 
differences, four additional participants were included in the data base. Two of these were 
university based scientists, one of whom did not have a PhD. The other two were a science 
educator and an industry scientist. 




849 



Differences between scientists and science educators were examined in three areas: (a) 
accuracy responses to the propositions; (b) importance responses to the proposition statements; 
and (c) responses to items statements that had failed to meet the content validity criteria. The one- 
way between-groups MANOVA procedure, combined with the Scheffe multiple comparison test, 
was used to look for between-group differences. Scheffe’ s test was chosen because: (a) it is 
suitable for post-hoc comparisons; and (b) it is less likely to indicate significant differences than 
the Tukey or Bonferroni tests (Lomax, 1992). This conservative approach was used because of 
the different cell sizes in the study. The MANOVA procedure was run for the accuracy responses 
for the propositions, for the importance responses for the propositions, and for the items 
corresponding to each proposition that had not met the content validity criteria. When comparing 
scientists and science educators, if there was only one item to be tested for a given proposition, a t- 
test was used. 

Limitations 

The study was conducted using a Likert scale survey, and therefore suffered from all the 
shortcomings of this methodology. Notable among these shortcomings is the inability to gather 
information beyond that which was requested in the instrument. The follow-up study did attempt 
to address, for selected items, why respondents replied in a given way. 

No claim can be made that the respondents in this study constitute a random sample. The 
methods used to recruit participants are described and the demographic data on the respondents are 
presented below. 

Approximately three times as many scientists responded to the survey as did university 
based science educators. This imbalance in the number of respondents in the two groups means 
that comparison of the views of scientists and university based science educators must be 
interpreted with caution. 

Results 

Participants 

Forty-five agency scientists responded to the survey, forty-three of whom had either a 
Ph D. or M.D. degree. Responses were secured from 27 industry based scientists, one of whom 
did not have a Ph D. Forty-four university based scientists responded, and with one exception, all 
had Ph D. degrees. Thirty-eight science educators responded. Four participants were doctoral 
students with two describing themselves as “all but dissertation.” Another science educator, an 




850 



873 



instructor at a community college, did not have a Ph.D. The other responding educators had either 
Ph D. or Ed.D. degrees. One hundred and twenty-three males and 3 1 females participated in the 
study, with the largest number of females, 16, being science educators. The demographics of the 
respondents are presented in Tables 1 (by type and field) and 2 (type and gender) below.

Validation 



The primary purpose of this study was to explore the content validity of a model of 
scientific literacy and the item statements that operationalize the model against the opinions of 
scientists and science educators. The results presented below are based on the responses of all 
participants. 

Proposition Statements 




851 




The eight proposition statements all met the a priori criterion for accuracy. This criterion 
was a mean accuracy score of less than 3.0 on a six point scale on which 1 equaled strongly agree, 
and 6 equaled strongly disagree that the proposition is an accurate statement about the nature of 
scientific knowledge. Five propositions resulted in mean accuracy scores below 2.0. These 
propositions state that scientific knowledge: (a) is developmental; (b) reflects the contributions of 
many diverse individuals; (c) is relevant in many fields and endeavors; (d) is testable; and (e) is 
the product of human creativity. Three propositions produced mean accuracy scores between 2.0 
and 3.0. These statements propose that scientific knowledge is: (a) unified; (b) amoral; and(c) 
parsimonious. The means and standard deviations for the accuracy score for each proposition are 
presented in Table 3, ranked from lowest (most accurate) to highest mean. Tukey’s HSD test 
revealed hq significant difference at the 0.05 level for propositions 2, 8, 7 and 3; 7, 3 and 1; and 
4, 5, and 6.

The frequency distribution of responses to the unified and parsimonious propositions were 
similar. Each had the greatest frequencies at the low (agreement that the statement is accurate) end 
of the scale and tapered off to fewer responses at the high (disagreement) end. On the unified 
proposition, for example, 59% of respondents either strongly agreed or agreed, 32% either weakly

agreed or weakly disagreed, and 9% either disagreed or strongly disagreed that the statement is 
accurate. In contrast, the amoral proposition resulted in a U-shaped frequency distribution with 
60% of respondents either strongly agreeing or agreeing, 13% either weakly agreeing or weakly 
disagreeing, and 27% disagreeing or strongly disagreeing that the statement is accurate. 

Seven of the eight propositions met the importance criterion — a mean importance score less 
than 3.0 — for inclusion in the model. Four statements had scores below 2.0 These propositions 
claimed that scientific knowledge is: (a) developmental; (b) relevant in many fields and endeavors; 
(c) testable; (d) a reflection of the contributions of many diverse individuals; and (e) a product of 
human creativity. Three propositions scored between 2.0 and 3.0. These stated that scientific 
knowledge is: (a) a product of human creativity; (b) unified; and (c) parsimonious. The mean 
score for the amoral proposition was 3 .05, just above the prescribed criterion. The means and 
standard deviations for the propositional importance scores are presented in Table 4, ranked from 
lowest mean (most important) to highest mean. Tukey’s HSD test revealed hq significant 
difference at the 0.05 level between propositions 2, 7, 3 and 8; 8 and 1; and 4 and 6.

The frequency distribution for the amoral proposition responses was again different from 
the others. The other propositions had the greatest frequencies at the low (agreement that the 





853 



statement is accurate) end of the scale and tapered off to fewer responses at the high (disagreement) 
end. In contrast, the distribution for the amoral proposition was approximately flat, with maxima 
of 25% and 24% at 1 (strongly agree) and 3 (weakly agree). Fifteen percent of participants agreed 
(response choice 2) that the amoral proposition was important. Therefore, although the amoral 
proposition failed to meet the importance standard, 64% of the respondents indicated that they at 
least weakly agreed that the amoral proposition is an important statement about the nature of 
scientific knowledge. 

Summary 

Based on the a priori criteria for mean accuracy and importance scores, seven of the eight 
propositions were eligible for inclusion in the instrument. The eligible propositions can be 
categorized into two groups according to their mean accuracy and importance scores. The group 
with higher ranked accuracy and importance consists of the propositions that scientific knowledge 
is: (a) developmental; (b) relevant in many fields and/or endeavors; (c) the product of the 
contributions of many diverse individuals; (d) testable; and (e) the product of human creativity. 
Two propositions formed a second group with lower rated accuracy and importance: these state 
that scientific knowledge is: (a) parsimonious; and (b) unified. 

The eighth proposition — that scientific knowledge is amoral — was ineligible based on the 
prescribed criteria. Its mean importance score of 3.05 was just over the limit of 3.0 on a six point 
scale for which a high score indicated low importance. 

Item Statements 

Forty-five items met the prescribed content validity standard. Fifteen items were in the 
best, 12 in the better, and 18 in the good categories. The items that met the standards are presented 
in Tables 5-10. Table 1 1 displays those items that did not satisfy the content validity criteria.

Scientific Knowledge as Testable 

Two items relating to the testability of scientific knowledge failed to meet the content 
validity criteria. These two items were included in the follow-up study being done to gain insight 
into interesting instances of non-consensus. 

All scientific knowledge is testable. At a point in the data collection when 140 responses 
had been received, 16 participants had responded that: (a) item 1 1 — all scientific knowledge is 
testable — is either definitely true or true; and (b) item 38 — some scientific knowledge can never be 
tested — is either definitely false or false. Twelve of these respondents had provided valid e-mail 
addresses. Of these 12, 1 1 responded to an invitation to share their thinking on the testability of 
science. The common theme to their responses was that, by definition, scientific knowledge is 
testable. Arguments included “if it is scientific, it is testable” (agency scientist), “knowledge that 
cannot be tested strikes me as much closer to faith than science” (university scientist), “it is the 
testable nature and the empirical evidence that separate science from other ways of knowing” 
(science educator), “observations that cannot be repeated or theories that cannot be tested would 
fall outside of what I consider to be scientific knowledge” (agency scientist). 

An agency scientist noted that the intended audience for the instrument under development 
was crucial to his response. He stated that 5th-graders can understand: (a) the difference between 
direct and indirect tests; and (b) that logical consistency is not adequate in science, scientific 
knowledge must involve the physical world; that is, be testable. 

Not All Scientific Knowledge is Testable. Eight respondents answered that item 1 1 is 
definitely false, or false and that item 38 is definitely true or true. Another seven respondents 
joined this group when the responses were extended to include mostly false and mostly true. One 
of the respondents in this second group did not give an e-mail address. Six participants provided 
an explanation of their reasoning on the testability items. Reasons fell into three categories. The 
first category focused on the issue of direct testability. For example, a university scientist wrote 
that “the origin of life on earth will never be known as an observed event.” An agency scientist 
gave the example that we do not have gas samples from the sun. The second category resulted 
from interpreting test to mean prove. This is illustrated by the argument that “it is highly doubtful, 
due to necessarily fragmentary fossil evidence, that scientists will ever be able to prove a particular 
scenario of human evolution” (university scientist). The third cluster hinged around the inclusion 
of all scientific theories as examples of scientific knowledge. A university scientist, using 




mo 883 



cosmology as an example, stated that “there may well come a time when two alternative models 
make predictions that cannot be tested because it is simply impossible to make the relevant 
measurements.” 

Scientific Explanations: Discovered or Created? 

With 144 responses received, 30 participants indicated that the statement that scientific 
explanations are discovered in nature, not created by scientists (item 66) is either definitely true or 
true. The 20 who provided valid e-mail addresses and had not been asked to elaborate on the 
testability items were invited to explain their response to this item. Seven provided explanations. 
Thirty-four respondents gave the opposite response to item 66. Twenty-three of these participants 
were asked to discuss their response to this item, and 12 complied. 

Discovered. The reasons given for answering that it is true to state that scientific 
explanations are discovered, not created, fell into two camps. The first camp made no distinction 
between explanation and observation; the second emphasized that scientific explanations must be 
consistent with nature and that the word create implies fabricate. 

Evidence for the equating of explanation and observation included the comment by an 
agency scientist that natural phenomena are not created by the scientist, only the words used to 
explain the phenomena are created by scientists. A second agency scientist observed that scientists 
put explanations into words “but the explanation itself is a reality .” As an illustrative example, he 
observed that “gold does not exist because someone discovered it any more than its specific gravity 
is greater than silver’s because it was articulated as such.” A university scientist stated that the key 
to his response was the meaning of the word explanation. He interpreted explanation as referring 
to the “fundamental relationships that make up a scientific ‘truth’” and asserted that “these 
relationships are discovered by scientists as they examine nature.” This respondent noted that if 
explanations are read as “the verbalized descriptions of these relationships, the verbal constructs 
themselves clearly are created by the writer/speaker.” 

Illustrating the concern that create implies fraud, a university scientist wrote that “scientists 
don’t create explanations but rather they use the information acquired in nature to develop an 
explanation.” A second university scientist reported that he interpreted the item to state that 
“natural observations (and experimentation) lead to scientific explanations and that scientists do not 
create (fabricate or make up) the explanations in isolation.” 

Created. An industry scientist wrote that whereas science is grounded in nature, “nature 




861 



does not supply scientists with explanations for how and why it works the way it does; scientists, 
after observing and measuring nature, create possible explanations.” A science educator stated his 
belief that it is false to assert that scientific explanations “are lying around in nature waiting for 
scientists to pick them up.” An agency scientist wrote that “nature does not explain anything, 
scientists do all the explaining.” This position was echoed by a science educator who stated that 
he was “not sure what is discovered in nature, but it is certainly not explanations” which, he 
asserted, “are created in the mind.” 

A university scientist stated that scientific explanations are “essentially models that are 
consistent with observations and measurements” and said that they are the products of scientific 
minds using inductive and deductive reasoning. To support his contention, this respondent 
provided an example from his fieldwork in Africa. A local tribe, whose members’ lives were 
intimately intertwined with nature, observed that the huge nests of the Hammerkopp, a small bird, 
overhang the river but do not get flooded. “The local natives deduced that because the 
Hammerkopp nests do not flood, the bird must control the height of the river. Therefore each year 
the local medicine man captures a Hammerkopp and stakes it to the riverbank to control the height 
of the flood. This tribe has made little progress in flood prognostication over the last 10,000 
years.” The respondent used this example to illustrate his contention that “scientific discovery is 
not made by the simple act of observing. While observations are an essential prerequisite, 
scientific discovery is the product of a framework of carefully organized thought, critical thinking 
and model development.” 

Group Differences 

A second purpose of this study was to explore differences in the perception of the nature of 
scientific knowledge between different groups. Scientists and science educators (kind) were 
compared. Scientists were also grouped in two ways: (a) by working environment — agency, 
industry, or university (type); and (b) by discipline (field). The groups of scientists were 
compared to each other and to science educators. 

Scientists versus Science Educators (Kindi 

In this analysis all responding scientists were placed into one group. Scientists and science 
educators were then compared for differences in their rating of the accuracy of the propositions, the 
importance of the propositions, and their responses on items that failed to meet the content validity 
criteria.

Accuracy of the Proposition Statements 

The data on the accuracy of the proposition statements were analyzed using a one-way 
MANOVA between-groups design. The analysis revealed a significant multivariate effect in the 
comparison of scientists and science educators — Wilk’s Lambda = .87, E = 2.57 (8, 147); j) = 
.01 . The individual ANOVA results showed that a single variable — proposition 8, which states 
that scientific knowledge reflects the contribution of many diverse individuals — was significantly 
different. The ANOVA results are summarized in Table 12.

science educators with respect to the importance of the eight proposition statements — Wilk's 
Lambda = 0.73, F = 6.36 (8, 140); £= .0001. The ANOVA results identified proposition 1 — 
scientific knowledge is the product of human creativity — and proposition 5 — scientific knowledge

Item Statements 



The amoral, testable, creative, and parsimonious propositions all had more than one item 
that failed to meet the content validity standards. When the group of items corresponding to a 
particular proposition were tested using the MANOVA procedure, there were no significant 
differences. The developmental, diverse, and unified propositions each had a single item that did 
not satisfy the content validity criteria. T-tests for each of these items indicated that there was a 
significant difference (p = .009) between scientists and science educators for the developmental 
item — we can be sure that science always gives the right answers to questions about nature (item 
10). The mean and standard deviation for scientists (N = 139) were 5.68 and 1.94, and for 



science educators (N = 39) they were 6.54 and 1 .65. There was no significant difference for either 
the diverse or the unified item. 

Scientists bv Environment and Science Educators (Type') 

For this analysis, the scientists were broken down into three groups — agency, industry, 
and university scientists. The three groups of scientists and science educators were compared. 
Accuracy of the Proposition Statements 

The MANOVA procedure revealed a significant multivariate difference (p = .02) for the 
comparison of the three groups of scientists and science educators. The ANOVA results showed a 
significant between-groups difference for propositions 1 — scientific knowledge is the product of 
human creativity (p = .05); 6 — scientific knowledge is parsimonious (p = .04); and 8 — scientific 
knowledge reflects the contributions of many diverse individuals (p = .04). Scheffe’s test, 
however, failed to reveal any significant between-groups differences. 

Importance of the Proposition Statements 

The MANOVA procedure revealed a significant multivariate difference — Wilkes Lambda = 
0.59, E = 3.35 (24, 401); p = 0.0001. Propositions 1 (creative), 3 (testable), and 5 (amoral) were 
shown to exhibit significant between-group differences. The ANOVA results for these three 
variables are summarized in Tables 18, 19, and 20.

The Scheffe test identified significant differences between science educators and agency 
scientists, and science educators and industry scientists on the importance of the creativity 
proposition. There were also significant differences between: (a) industry and university based 
scientists with respect to the importance of the testability proposition; and (b) science educators 
and university scientists on the importance of the amoral proposition. The data are displayed in 
Tables 21 (means and standard distributions) and 22 (frequency distributions).

Item Statements 

The MANOVA test to compare groups of items by proposition found no significant 
difference for the items under the amoral, creative, developmental, and diverse propositions. 
Significant multivariate difference were found for items representing the testable, parsimonious, 
and unified propositions. 




868 



Testable. There were four items from the testable proposition that did not show consensus. 
The MANOVA test of these items indicated a significant difference — Wilk’s Lambda = 0.96, E_= 
2.48 (12, 397); p = .004. The ANOVA results, summarized in Table 23, identified item 26 — new 
scientific knowledge will not be accepted until it has been tested many times — as the source of this 
difference. Scheffe’s multiple comparison test located significant differences between university 
scientists and agency scientists, university scientists and industry scientists, and industry scientists 
and science educators. The means and standard deviations are presented in Table 24, the 
frequency distribution in Table 25.

Parsimonious. Six items from the parsimonious proposition failed to meet the content 
validity standards. The MANOVA test of this group of items indicated a significant 
difference — Wilk’s Lambda = 0.78, E_= 2.1 1 (18, 419); p =.006. According to the ANOVA 
results, three of these items produced significant differences. These were items 24 — scientists try 
to find simple scientific explanations for what happens in nature; 39 — given a choice between two 
explanations for something, scientists will choose the more simple explanation; and 62 — scientists 
prefer simple scientific explanations to complicated ones. The ANOVA summaries for these items

Scientists bv Discipline and Science Educators (Fields 

This analysis was performed to see if there was evidence of discipline-based differences in 
scientists’ perceptions of scientific knowledge. Five disciplines — biology, physics/astronomy, 
chemistry, geology, and biomedical — and science education were compared. 

Accuracy of the Proposition Statements 

The MANOVA results revealed no significant multivariate difference. However, both the 
ANOVA results and the Scheffe test indicated that there was a significant difference between 
biologists and chemists with respect to the accuracy of the creative proposition. A t-test of the 
means for biologists and chemists (1.19 and 2.40 respectively) with respect to the importance of 
the accuracy proposition indicated a significant difference (p = .0004). The frequency distributions 
for the two disciplines, shown in Table 34, appeared to differ.

Item Statements 



The item statements that did not meet the consensus criteria were tested in groups by 
propositions. A MANOVA indicated a significant difference (g = .03) for the three items from the 
creativity proposition, and the ANOVAs revealed that this difference was significant (g = .035) for 
item 66 — scientific explanations are discovered in nature, not created by scientists — and almost 
significant (p = .051) for item 12 — good scientists are creative people. The Scheffe test, however, 
failed to pinpoint the differences by field. MANOVA tests for the multiple items in the amoral, 
testable, and parsimonious propositions produced no significant differences. ANOVAs for the 
single items from the developmental, diverse, and unified propositions also produced no 
significant differences.

Discussion 



Primary Purpose 

This study was designed to provide answers to two questions. These questions were: (a) 
which of the eight proposed propositional statements are judged by scientists and science educators 
to be accurate and important statements about the nature of scientific knowledge? (b) for which of 
the 64 suggested item statements is there agreement among scientists and science educators as to 
the truth or falsity of the statement? Note is made that the questions were posed in terms of what is 
intellectually honest, but appropriate for 5th-grade students; that is, 10- and 1 1-year-olds. 

Propositions 

The study showed that five propositions were rated high with respect to their accuracy and 
importance as statements regarding the nature of scientific knowledge. These propositions were 
that scientific knowledge is: (a) developmental; (b) a reflection of contributions of many diverse 
individuals; (c) relevant in many fields and/or endeavors; (d) testable; and (e) the product of 
human creativity. Two additional propositions were endorsed, though less strongly, as accurate 
and important statements about scientific knowledge. These two propositions state that scientific 
knowledge is: (a) unified; and (b) parsimonious. A final proposition — that scientific knowledge 
is amoral — was rated accurate, but not important. 

Item Statements 

The study identified 45 items for which there was expert consensus as to the truth or falsity 
of the statement and the 19 items for which there was no consensus. The explanations provided by 
participants in the follow-up piece on the testability of scientific knowledge provided insight into 
the reasons why there was not consensus with respect to items 1 1 and 38. On one side, in stating 
that scientific knowledge must be testable, respondents identified testability as the sine qua non of 
scientific knowledge. On the other, those who said not all scientific knowledge must be testable 
equated test with prove, limited test to direct observation, or included scientific theories as a type of 
scientific knowledge and asserted that not all theories are testable. The items state that: (a) all 
scientific knowledge is testable (item 1 1); and (b) some scientific knowledge can never be tested 
(item 38). Equating test with prove in the context of these items is, I argue, unjustified; tests both 
support/prove and disprove. I assert that, in science, the term test has long included indirect 
methods. The knowledge that matter is composed of atoms was arrived at with no direct 
observation of atoms, yet the existence of atoms was convincingly supported by the results of 



O 

ERLC

indirect tests. Theories that have been supported by varied and reliable evidence and have come to 
be widely accepted by the scientific community may be considered scientific knowledge — though 
any given theory is subject to being proved inadequate or even wrong. However, a theory that 
cannot be tested because it is impossible to make relevant measurements is unlikely to gain general 
acceptance by scientists, and is not an example of scientific knowledge . 

The arguments in favor of the testability of scientific knowledge are, in my judgment, 
simple and convincing. Testability is the essential test of scientific knowledge; the reliance on 
empirical evidence is what separates science from other ways of knowing. I conclude that it is 
unreasonable to reject the statement that all scientific knowledge is testable based on: (a) limiting 
tests to direct observation; (b) equating test and prove; or (c) classifying speculative, untestable 
theories as examples of scientific knowledge. I argue that the data from the follow-up study is 
more convincing than that from the survey, and conclude that the claims that: (a) all scientific 
knowledge is testable (true); and (b) some scientific knowledge can never be tested (false) are 
valid statements about the nature of scientific knowledge. 

The exploration of item 66 revealed the reasons for the opposing views on the question of 
whether scientific explanations are discovered or created. Those in favor of scientific explanations 
as discoveries, not creations, either did not distinguish between observations and explanations, or 
interpreted create to imply fraud. 

The argument that the words used to explain phenomena are created by scientists supported 
the opposite position, that scientific explanations are created, not discovered. The assertion that 
scientists put explanations into words, but that the explanations themselves are reality, illustrated 
by reference to the specific gravities of gold and silver illustrates the failure to discriminate between 
observation and explanation. Further, I reject the argument that explanations are reality. Does any 
scientist believe that scientific explanations are beyond revision or even rejection? How can this 
revision or rejection be possible if scientific explanations are reality? The scientist who made the 
argument that explanations are reality added that scientists do not create explanations, but use data 
to develop explanations. Surely a scientist who develops an explanation is creating, not 
discovering, it. 

The meaning of explanation was crucial for another respondent. With explanation 
interpreted as the fundamental relationships that make up scientific truth, he argued for the 
discovery position. However, if explanations are interpreted as the verbalized descriptions of 



observed relationships, explanations are created not discovered, he said. I say the fundamental 
relationships observed in nature are not explanations; they are observations. Further, the 
verbalization of these relationships are not explanations. They are scientific laws. An explanation 
describes why or how these relationships exist. If the verbalization of a scientific law is a human 
creation, then certainly explanations are also creations. 

The response, discussed above, that scientists do not create explanations, but use data to 
develop explanations hints at the interpretation of create to mean falsify. Another respondent 
explicitly identified this equating of creation and fraud. I maintain that using one’s imagination to 
create data is indeed scientific fraud; using this same imagination to interpret and explain legitimate 
data is integral to the scientific process. 

Those arguing that explanations are created, not discovered were, I believe, more 
convincing than those maintaining the opposite position. Artifacts, natural behavior and processes, 
and relationships exist in nature. Scientists strive to discover/observe these. The artifacts, 
behaviors, processes, and relationships, however, exist whether or not they are discovered or 
observed. Explanations, in contrast, are the result of scientists interpretation of physical evidence, 
and as such do not exist until created. Based on the data from the follow-up study, the conclusion 
is made that scientific explanations are indeed created, not discovered. However, the wording of 
the original statement — scientific explanations are discovered in nature, not created by 
scientists — is judged to be problematic. The concept will be expressed with a rewritten 
statement — scientific explanations do not exist until they are created by scientists. This wording 
will be submitted to the participants in the follow-up study, and if there is consensus as to its truth, 
it will be incorporated into the instrument. 

Secondary Purpose 

A second purpose of the study was to explore differences in the perceptions of nature of 
scientific knowledge among: (a) scientists and university based science educators; (b) scientists 
working in different environments and science educators; and (c) scientists from different 
disciplines and science educators. Differences were sought in the rating of the accuracy and 
importance of the propositions, and in responses to items that did not meet the content validity 
criteria. 



Scientists and Science Educators (Kind) 

Propositions 

When respondents were broken down into scientists and science educators, there was a 
significant difference between the responses of the two groups with respect to the importance of 
the amoral proposition. Scientists produced a mean importance score (2.74) that met the a priori 
criterion for accepting the proposition as important. Science educators, in contrast, produced a 
mean score (3.82) above the acceptable cut-off on a scale for which a low score indicated a high 
importance rating. This result may suggest that scientists, but not science educators, believe that it 
is important for 5th-graders to distinguish between the amorality of scientific knowledge itself and 
the production and/or use of scientific knowledge that are subject to moral judgment. The ANOVA 
r 2 value (.08) indicates that, though significant, this result should be interpreted cautiously. Work 

done with 5th-grade teachers and 5th- and 6th-grade students in the preliminary stages of this study 
suggested that 5th-graders are likely to have difficulty understanding the amorality proposition. 

The difference in the responses of the scientists and the educators to the importance of this 
proposition may reflect a better understanding of young students by the educators than by the 
scientists. An additional hypothesis as to this difference is suggested when the data from scientists 
is broken down by working environment — agency, industry, or university. 

The propositions that scientific knowledge is: (a) relevant in many fields and/or endeavors; 
and (b) reflects the contributions of many diverse individuals were not part of the previous models 
that provided the foundation for the present model. These two propositions were added to reflect 
emphases in the current science education reform literature. It is noteworthy that these two 
propositions were ranked in the top echelon with regard to both accuracy and importance by the 
responding experts. It is interesting that when the responses of scientists and science educators 
were compared, the scientists were more likely to strongly agree or agree (96%) that the 
proposition is accurate than were science educators (77%). This finding provides evidence that the 
propositions no! only reflect the position of science education reformers; there may be wide 
acceptance and valuing by scientists of the propositions that scientific knowledge is: (a) relevant in 
many fields and/or endeavors; and (b) reflects the contributions of many diverse individuals. 

Science educators (92%) were more likely than scientists (59%) to strongly agree or agree 
to the importance of the statement that scientific knowledge is a product of human creativity. When 
science educators focus on science content, the subject may often be the great breakthroughs in 



science, such as Newtonian mechanics or the unraveling of DNA. Individual scientists are more 
likely engaged in the incremental advancement of scientific knowledge than with the paradigm 
shifts that occasionally reorient the scientific world. This different perspective on scientific 
knowledge may explain the observed difference with respect to the creativity proposition. Science 
educators’ interest in student motivation may also cause them to attach greater importance to the 
role of human creativity in producing scientific knowledge. 

Item Statements 

When the 19 items for which there was not consensus were tested, there was a single item 
on which scientists and science educators differed significantly. The statement said that we can be 
sure that science always gives the right answers to questions about nature (item 10). The science 
educators’ mean score fell between mostly false and false, whereas the scientists’ mean score was 
between more false than true and mostly false. That is, science educators were more inclined to 
identify the statement as false than were scientists. 

During data collection, two science educators were critical of surveying scientists to 
establish the content validity of statements related to scientific literacy. The training and practice of 
working scientists were too narrow, they asserted, to qualify scientists as experts on scientific 
literacy. On the other hand, a scientist offered equally strong criticism for including science 
educators in the survey. This respondent stated that science educators know little or nothing about 
the scientific enterprise. In light of these criticisms, the overall similarity of the responses of 
scientists and science educators is interesting. There was a significant difference on the mean 
accuracy score for one proposition — diversity — but mean score of both groups fell between 
strongly agree and agree. The difference in the importance rating for the creativity proposition 
was significant, but both groups’ mean scores were on the agree side of the scale. There was only 
one proposition (amoral) for which the mean importance scores of scientists and science educators 
fell on different sides of the midpoint of the response scale, with scientists, but not science 
educators, agreeing that the proposition was important in a model intended for use with 5th- 
graders. For the item statements, there was no significant difference on 18 of 19 items tested. The 
difference in the one item was significant, but modest. The other 45 items satisfied the consensus 
criteria and were not examined.

Bv Environment (Type) 

Propositions 

When the data were looked at by the environment — agency, industry, or university — of the 
responding scientists there were no significant differences on the mean accuracy scores for the 
propositions. There were significant differences in the mean importance score for propositions 1 
(creative), 3 (testable), and 5 (amoral). 

Science educators rated the creative proposition significantly more important than did either 
agency or industry scientists, with 92% of science educators, 58% of agency scientists, and 52% 
of industry scientists strongly agreeing or agreeing that the proposition is important. In discussing 
the difference between scientists and science educators on this variable, it was suggested that the 
difference might be the result of the latter group’s likely focus on the paradigm shifts in science, 
and/or their interest in issues of student motivation. Both of these hypothesized explanations may 
be supported by the data showing that the position of science educators is significantly different 
from agency and industry scientists, but not university scientists. University scientists are likely to 
be teachers as well as researchers. It is reasonable to suggest that this teaching role is likely to 
focus, at least in part, on break-through science, and lead to a consideration of motivational 
factors. Agency and industry scientists, on the other hand, are less likely to teach than university 
scientists. Agency scientists may, therefore, be more focused than than university scientists on the 
incremental advance of scientific knowledge. 

On the importance of the amoral proposition, science educators and university based 
scientists were significantly different. Science educators produced a mean score between weakly 
disagree and disagree, whereas university scientists rated the proposition between agree and 
weakly agree; 16% of science educators and 66% of university scientists strongly agreed or agreed 
that the proposition is important. University scientists may be more likely than either agency or 
industry scientists to be pursuing pure, as opposed to, applied research. If this assumption is 
valid, it may be reasonable to speculate that the different research focus offers an explanation of 
why university scientists and science educators produced significantly different mean score for the 
importance of this proposition. Involved in pure research, the university scientist can easily 
separate knowledge from the methods used in its discovery, and/or the uses to which the 
knowledge is put. Science educators, who must focus on motivational issues, stress the practical 
importance of science to individuals and society may be less likely to make the distinction. Agency

and industry scientists, involved in applied research, fall between the university scientists and 
science educators, and produce means scores not significantly different from the mean scores of 
either group of professors. 

With respect to the importance of the testable proposition, university scientists averaged 
between strongly agree and agree, whereas the mean for industry scientists fell between agree and 
weakly agree. Even though these means were both on the agree side of the scale, and the ANOVA 

R.2 was only .07, there was a statistically significant difference. This result at first seems counter 

intuitive. If industry scientists are more likely to be engaged in applied research than are university 
scientists, as has been assumed in earlier hypothesizing, it would seem reasonable to assume that 
industry scientists would think in terms of testable knowledge. It may be that university scientists 
are more likely than industry scientists to include indirect methods within their conception of “test.” 
Unfortunately, a majority of the industry scientists who participated in the survey did not provide 
e-mail addresses, and so are not included in the follow-up study that is probing the issue of 
testability. Alternatively, compared to industry scientists, university scientists’ greater acceptance 
of the testability of science may be a product of their role as teachers. Science professors may 
focus on testability as the key distinction between scientific knowledge and other types of 
knowledge and/or pseudo-science. Unlike their university counterparts, industry scientists likely 
have no reason to focus on the differences between pseudo-science and science. 

Item Statements 

The 1 9 items that did not met the content validity standards were examined for significant 
differences between the responses of agency, industry, and university scientists, and science 
educators. Five of these items produced significant differences: one item from the testable 
proposition, one from the unified proposition, and three from the parsimonious proposition. 

Testable. Item 26 — new scientific knowledge will not be accepted until it has been tested 
many times — received a higher true rating from university scientists and science educators than 
from agency and industry scientists. This result may support an earlier argument: these two 
groups, both comprised of teachers, may be more cognizant than their colleagues in industry or at 
agencies of what is appropriate for young students. Given this awareness, these respondents may 
be more willing than agency or industry scientists to accept what some might claim is an idealized 
view of the scientific process as legitimate in the given context. 

Unified/Parsimonious. One item from the unified and three from the parsimonious 



propositions produced mean importance scores that were significantly different. Although it is 
difficult to speculate on the reasons for the differences, it is interesting that university scientists 
were different from agency and industry scientists on each of the four items. For three of the 
items, there was no significant difference between the university scientists and science educators. 

Modest R.2 ANOVA values (.06, .07, .11, and .13) suggest caution in interpreting the differences, 

but the data may support earlier arguments that, as teachers, university scientists hold views closer 
to science educators than to fellow scientists in industry or at agencies. 

Bv Discipline (Field! 

The MANOVA result showed no multivariate significant difference for the accuracy of the 
propositions based on the discipline of the respondents. The frequency distributions, however, 
may suggest that chemists are less likely to view scientific knowledge as the product of human 
creativity than are biologists. When the importance of the propositions was examined, chemists 
were less likely than science educators to rate the creative proposition as important. These results 
may suggest that chemists are less likely than scientists in other fields to view science knowledge 
as the product of human creativity. The evidence for such a conclusion, however, is very weak. 
No significant discipline based differences were identified for the tested item statements. 

The study produced no evidence of discipline based differences in the participants’ views 
of the nature of scientific knowledge. At first, this might appear surprising. Is physics not a very 
different endeavor than biology or geology? As is discussed below in looking at between-group 
differences in general, the model of scientific knowledge used in this study, designed for use with 
5th-graders, may be too simple to detect discipline based differences. 

Conclusions 

The preliminary work done prior to this study suggested that a Likert-type scale to measure 
Sth-grade students’ understanding of the nature of scientific knowledge is feasible and that the 
language used in the item statements is likely to be understood by 5th-graders. The study 
suggested that there is agreement among scientists and science educators that seven of the eight 
proposed broad propositional statements are accurate and important statements about the nature of 
scientific knowledge. One proposition — the amorality of scientific knowledge — narrowly missed 
the importance criteria. Based on the slimness of the margin, and the acceptance of the importance 
of the proposition by the responding scientists, the amorality proposition can be retained in the 
model at this time. 




The content validity of forty-five item statements has been supported by the survey 
component of the study. Based on the follow up elaboration of responses, two items — all 
scientific knowledge can be tested, and some scientific knowledge can never be tested — can be 
retained despite their failure to meet the prescribes content validity criteria. A rewritten version of a 
third item — scientific explanations are discovered in nature, not created by scientists — will be 
subjected to further testing and considered for inclusion in the pilot test instrument. 

The pilot test instrument will be subjected to further testing. This evaluation will include its 
use in a field test with 5th-grade students and review by elementary science education and 
measurement experts. 

In fulfilling its secondary purpose, the study suggested that compared to science educators, 
scientists are more likely to believe that it is accurate to say that scientific knowledge reflects the 
contributions of many diverse individuals and more likely to believe in the importance of the 
assertion that scientific knowledge is amoral; they are less likely than science educators to consider 
important the statement that scientific knowledge is the product of human creativity. These 
differences, though statistically significant, were modest, and the overarching result is that the 
study revealed little meaningful difference between the groups. When the participants were broken 
down by discipline, there is some evidence that university based scientists may hold views of 
scientific knowledge that are closer to their professorial colleagues in science education than to 
fellow scientists working in industry or agencies. Again, however, the differences, even where 
significant, are modest. 

The failure of the study to convincingly identify between-group differences may well reflect 
the simplicity of the model of scientific knowledge used. The model is intended for use with 5 th- 
grade students. The broad consensus on the proposition and item statements is evidence of the 
validity of the model and suggests its appropriateness for use with the intended audience. A more 
sophisticated model than the one used in this study might reveal more meaningful between-group 
differences than those discussed in this report

WHAT TEACHERS ARE TELLING US ABOUT REFORM: 
IMPLICATIONS FOR TEACHER EDUCATION. TEACHER 
LEARNING OF INNOVATIVE PRACTICES AT A MIDDLE 
SCHOOL SCIENCE REFORM SITE 

Kathleen S. Davis, University of Nevada Las Vegas 

Introduction 

Throughout the country, there are many efforts to bring varied forms of change to science 
education. Successful implementation, though hoped for, is not always guaranteed. Indeed there 
are many obstacles to change. As one informant in this study 1 described it, "Change is hard." 

"A systemic outlook is essential" to successful reform (Anderson et al., 1994) and teacher 
education is probably a key ingredient to innovative change (Anderson & Mitchener, 1994, p. 36). 
Teacher knowledge, experiences, and beliefs greatly impact what takes place within the classroom 
(Anderson, et al., 1994; Connelly & Clandinin, 1988), and research indicates that teachers who 
"hold beliefs and priorities that are incompatible with envisioned changes" may challenge the 
success of program reforms (Anderson et al., 1994, p. 81). 

What needs to be considered in order to support teachers' learning of new and innovative 
teaching practices? As educational leaders bring science reform programs to our nation's schools, 
"greater thought needs to be given to a theory of learning in teaching" (Carter, 1990, p. 307) so that 
teacher educators have a better understanding of not only what teachers know but also "how that 
knowledge is obtained or how it changes over time" (p. 307) and what are the "processes or 
mechanisms by which change is brought about" (Floden and Feiman in Burden, 1990, p. 318). 
Importantly, research needs to focus on inservice education within the context of schools where the 
aim is not only to bring about individual teacher transformation, but also deep and long-lasting 
change in science classrooms (Anderson & Mitchener, 1994, p. 37). 



'The research reported in this paper was completed as part of the Curriculum Reform Project, a study of 
curriculum change in mathematics, science, and critical thinking which' was funded by a grant from the 
U. S. Department of Education’s Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI Grant 
#R91182001). The opinions expressed herein are those of the author and the participants in this study.

There are many ways in which teacher learning can be facilitated and impeded in the process 
of implementing science reform curriculum, and in this paper I will address these factors from both 
a psychological perspective and from a sociocultural view (Anderson & Mitchener, 1994). Borko 
and Putnam (1996) point out that "Despite.. .expectations or demands for change, teachers are not 
typically treated as learners" (p. 702), and researchers suggest that teacher learning might be best 
addressed using a constructivist learning theory approach (Borko & Putnam, 1996; Carter, 1990). 

In addition, the context of the working place, its structure and social dynamics, may serve to 
support or work against teacher learning of new practices (Borko & Putnam, 1996; Sparks & 
Loucks-Horsley, 1990). 

This paper describes the pathways and impediments to teacher acquisition of new beliefs and 
instructional strategies as an innovative science curriculum was implemented at Fort Sheridan 
Middle School 2 . These factors include 1) how staff development was designed with constructivist 
underpinnings to facilitate teacher learning and how teachers perceived its effectiveness, 2) how the 
field test process limited the incorporation of teachers’ prior knowledge and how that impacted 
teacher acquisition of new knowledge and skills, 3) how regular and frequent staff development 
and the creation of a sixth-grade science team provided critical opportunities for interactions with 
colleagues and outside support personnel and how that contributed to teacher learning, and 4) how 
such interactive forums diminished after the field test, how old decision-making structures 
remained in place, and how that impacted further development of teacher knowledge and expertise 
and of a common vision of the science program among teachers. 

Data for this study was acquired through on-site visits at the school site over a period of nine 
months. Data was collected primarily through 1) classroom observations, 2) observations of 
faculty meetings, 3) interviews with the program developers, administrators, teachers, students, 
and university site-coordinators and support personnel, 4) science curriculum materials, and 5) 
state and district documents that address the reform effort.

The Study Site: Fort Sheridan Middle School 

Fort Sheridan Middle School (FSMS) is situated on a large military base in an agricultural 
region adjacent to a city with a population just above 20,000. At the time of this study, FSMS's 
student population of about 700 students was 48.3% white, 37.8% African-American, 8.5% 
Hispanic, 4.4% Asian or Pacific Islander, and 1.0% American Indian or Alaskan Native. About 
47% percent of the students were male and 53% of them were female. Most of the student's 
parents were military personnel (91.9%) and 87.8% of the students lived on the military base. 
Many of these students' parents were enlisted personnel. 

As FSMS made the change to becoming a middle school, some of the junior high faculty 
moved to the high school and new faculty arrived from the elementary buildings; some junior high 
faculty remained at Fort Sheridan The middle school science faculty consisted of seven teachers. 

During the three years that the science reform curriculum was field-tested, all three of the 
sixth grade science teachers were elementary-based; Lisa was a sixth grade elementary science 
educator and Karen and Nancy were elementary generalists. After the field test, Lisa and Karen 
remained at FSMS. Rhonda joined the sixth grade science team during the fourth year of the 
reform. Her experience was as a secondary art and home economics teacher, and her science 
background was embedded in the science coursework required as part of her home economics 
major. 

The seventh and eighth grade science faculty came with experience in secondary education. 
Two teachers previously taught science at Fort Sheridan Jr. High School, one taught life science 
and the other taught physical science. Another teacher was transferred from a science position at 
the district's other junior high school, and the seventh teacher came from the district's alternative 
high school. 

With the implementation of the new middle school structure, the district administration 
sought a new science curriculum that would provide a vehicle for implementing the teaching 
approaches and strategies professed in the middle school philosophy.

We were junior highs.. .and we had the traditional, very segregated kind of 
approach of junior high science. Everything was separate-earth science, 
physical science— each year you got a different piece. 

There were several things wrong. One of the things.. .was that it was 
not endearing kids to science... when they got to high school, they were 
taking what was required and they were bailing out.... 

The other thing that was wrong.. .was that there was a real... 
willingness and acceptance of tracking... [and] there's just no place for 
it....[W]e have an obligation to all the students.. .The absolute commitment 
that these kids will be successful. That's what effective schools is all 
about.. .if you're willing to be honest to the middle school format, you must 
give up...tracking...and that's what we aimed for... 

[T]hat's what made.. .the change [to] the middle school— the problems 
with.. .only serving some and the failure of these courses to have any meaning 
as the kid grew. [The schools] were just fertile soil for a change... 

The middle school science reform curriculum that was enlisted to bring about this change is 
part of a national curriculum development project that was funded by the National Science 
Foundation (NSF) in the late 1980's. This program seeks to 1) develop middle school students' 
understanding of basic concepts and skills related to science and technology, 2) increase the 
participation and success of under-represented populations (i.e., girls and minorities) in science 
classes, 3) improve students' understanding of how science and technology relate to their everyday 
lives, and 4) promote the development of higher-order thinking skills. 

The curriculum is interdisciplinary and is centered around key conceptual themes and major 
organizing concepts. The program uses an instructional model based on constructivist learning 
theory where 

...learning requires active involvement of the student in constructing 
meaning... .[T]he learner must negotiate meaning with his/her learning

community, make connections with past personal understandings— modifying 
these prior conceptions if they are not accurate— and build understandings 
...that are part of that person's personal conceptual framework... within a 
learning community or context. (Anderson et al., 1994, p. 2) 

In this program, students ask questions, develop operational definitions, gather evidence, construct 
their own meanings and explanations for phenomena, design approaches and projects that will 
solve problems and answer questions, and then test their explanations through hands-on 
investigations. Students use cooperative learning strategies to discuss ideas and to work together 
to solve problems. 

The Tensions and Dilemmas Encountered Based on Differing Values. Beliefs and Experiences 
Teachers came to the reform with varying degrees of knowledge about and experience with 
the instructional approaches of the curriculum and not all teachers held a belief system that 
coincided with the reform. Some of the teachers came into the field test with a better understanding 
of these key concepts, strategies, and skills than did others. According to one member of the 
university science site support staff, those that 

bought into it from the beginning already had a lot of the skills needed to 
make the program work... It matched up with what they were trying to 
do.. .and they saw this program as a help to accomplish what they were trying 
to do anyway. 

For these educators, the opportunity to pilot the science reform curriculum was something they had 
long awaited. 

For years I have dug for things.. ."Those of you who teach right from the 
book, is that good for kids?" You have to look at what's best for kids. I 
guess that's where I came to leap into [this program]. I had searched and 
hunted and begged and borrowed and stolen everything I could, to get some

hands-on science. And [now] you don't have to go try to find all of it. And I 
was like, "Oh, hallelujah!" 

...[W]e were just in the process of changing over to be a middle school, and it 
sounded like it fit exactly into the philosophy that we'd been going through 
and trying to come up with as we wanted to be a middle school. 

I felt like we were presented with an option that to me sounded wonderful. 

The idea of teaching science through a hands-on program and more from 
a.. .process rather than a product sort of viewpoint.. .that really made a lot of 
sense because the kids...leam by doing. 

Some of these teachers had already successfully used cooperative learning strategies in their 
classrooms. Some of them were working to make changes in their approaches to teaching by 
working with university personnel to develop and adapt effective strategies for outdoor, hands-on 
science activities for their classrooms. 

For other teachers, the science reform curriculum was very different from what they normally 
did in their classrooms. 

[T]hey didn’t have the same philosophy. ..and they weren't so skilled.... 

There were a couple of teachers... who weren't convinced that the.. .new 
way was.. .better than the old way.. .and had some problems adjusting... 
this was a total departure from what they wanted to do in their classrooms 
and so they did not have that same kind of philosophy. ..of what ought to be 
going on in the classroom. Teachers that were more teacher-directed had [a] 
harder time. Those that were more student-oriented let the students discover 
and were more successful. 





894 



Such teachers felt that they had been teaching successfully for many years and saw little need to 
make changes in their teaching philosophy. For some, then, there was "an inertia and resistance to 
be overcome." 

As teachers came to this reform with a variety of teaching backgrounds and experiences, 
there were also questions and concerns about how supposedly "non-science" people could teach 
the curriculum and how the program best utilized the expertise of those who had a science 
background. There were questions about student assessment— what was it like with this program? 
There were concerns that the administration would not adopt the published program at the end of 
the field test and that the field test would be more work for teachers. Some teachers felt that there 
was already a great deal of change taking place with the move to the middle school and that the 
field test would add to the stress. 

Some science teachers felt that they were not being fully informed about the program; as one 
teacher explained it, "There wasn't any information on the program... They had no books for us to 
look at, they had nothing..." Others felt that they were not being given any choice; if one person 
wanted to do the program, they all had to do it. "We were told we had to do it," one teacher 
explained. Another teacher stated, ”...[I]t was voluntary; then it wasn't." 

Two faculty members were definitely not in favor of the new program. "They wanted 
science as it was." "They felt that that wasn't what they wanted to do as teaching science." One 
of the dissenting faculty members quit because of the decision to field test the new curriculum. He 
basically said, "I'll not teach it" and he left the district. 

The principal, new to the school, was supportive of the program as "it was a good 
opportunity... to do something new." He said, "You know, we'd like a consensus" from the 
faculty. 

It appeared, though, that the remaining teachers' willingness to commit to trying the program 
and to work together was what allowed the field test to happen. One teacher related that, "I think 
we had the belief that 'this can work'" and that the faculty held elements of "enthusiasm" and 
"hope." Another teacher stated that 




895 918 



...I think that most everybody. ..that's here now is.. .real open to giving it a 
try.. ..I think that what really helped keep it going is that everybody... was 
really willing to give it a shot....[T]he people that we had here... really made 
it work. 

Most of the teachers that had come to the middle school did so because they wanted to and 
"most of them were change people." Other teachers, though not in favor of it, reluctantly said, "I 
will give it a try." As the implementation process began, "The enthusiasm and success of the other 
teachers" and the support and "encouragement that they gave" were helpful in motivating those 
who were hesitant. 

So it was important to look not only at where teachers were in the process of reform, but also 
where these teachers began. For some teachers the reform process was an opportunity to use a 
program as a vehicle to implement new approaches and strategies that reflected where they were 
and where they wanted to go. For others, it became an opportunity to reflect on long-held ideas 
and beliefs about learning. A university staff member pointed out that "Some people invite 
change....Some of the more reluctant initially gained a lot from the experience. Change doesn't 
happen overnight. It takes longer for some people." 

Teacher Learning 

Teachers, administrators, program developers, and university support staff all believed that it 
was valuable for teachers to have a background in the philosophy and goals that frame the 
program. 

I think that one thing that's super valuable is.. .not to just throw this in 
(and) say, "Here, this is what you're going to teach."... .[Y]ou do need a lot 
of the training and a lot of the background and the philosophy of it to make it 
successful 'cause you've got to be in that mind set, "OK this is what we're 
trying to go towards."

As constructivist learning theory provides the basis for the instructional approaches used in 
this reform, it also provides an underlying framework for discussion of teacher learning during the 
reform process. The reform curriculum provided students with opportunities to construct their own 
understanding. Students 1) reflected on personal knowledge and prior experiences, 2) participated 
in interactive, hands-on activities, 3) asked questions, solved problems, and used new knowledge, 
and 4) communicated and worked with others in cooperative teams. The science education 
standards for this state paralleled the learning goals and instructional approaches of the reform and, 
interestingly, the state set these curricular standards for "teachers as well as students." The 
curricular standards state that 

the following characteristics must be present in a transformed science program. 

Teachers as well as students must: 



—be challenged to become skillful thinkers and problem-solvers 
—work together in groups and teams 
—be creative 
—value curiosity 

—persevere in long term investigation 
—communicate effectively 

—apply what they leam to authentic needs within their own communities 

—be flexible and adaptable to changes and discoveries 

—make connections between the fundamental concepts of our natural 



world as well as between science, technology, and society. 

What was valued as important for student learning was equally important for teacher learning. 

In addition, the program developers decided to use the instructional model of the curriculum 
as the model for professional development. The teachers needed to experience "dissonance" with 
their old approaches; they had to become uncomfortable with what they had been doing to see the 
value of what they were implementing. During staff-development and early in-service sessions, 
facilitators were clear about the fact: "We teach you the same way that you can teach your students

897 



about the program." Therefore, it's important to address teacher learning of new philosophies, 
beliefs, and instructional approaches through a constructivist framework. 

Staff Development and Support for Change 

In order to present teachers with the philosophy and skills of the new science curriculum, 
program developers provided them with staff development in order to "give field-test teachers first- 
hand experience with the philosophy, goals, teaching strategies, activities, equipment, and 
materials of the curriculum.. .[and] opportunities to learn more about cooperative learning, the 
instructional model, and interdisciplinary curriculum development." Throughout the field test, 
inservice sessions provided a time for teachers to share ideas on how the science program was 
working in their classrooms and to talk about learning theory, alternative assessment, cooperative 
learning, content learning, and management strategies. Teachers were asked to think about their 
teaching philosophy and to draw upon their prior knowledge about learning. For example, 
constructivism was presented as a theory of leaming~"How do you know what you know?" 
Teachers would discuss how these learning concepts and instructional strategies were applied in 
the reform curriculum. 

Teachers reacted differently to this approach. For one particular teacher, it seemed evident 
that the in-service provided an opportunity to reflect on long-held beliefs about student learning. A 
university staff member stated, 

We brought up some of those issues. I will say that they weren't very well 
received.. .some of these teachers [were] sitting there going, "Who cares 
about this?" although a couple of them got into it. And one thing that I 
thought was interesting, is [a] teacher.. .that started out very antagonistic 
towards the program.. .interacted the most on those kinds of discussions. ...I 
think a lot of the reasons why he started changing his mind was that he started 
questioning some of the assumptions about what science is....So for most of 
them.. .it was like this is just ivory tower stuff you hear in a university. ..but I 




ERIC 



898 



think there were a couple who it was important for— this one individual in 
particular. 

Concepts key to the science program and cooperative learning strategies were presented using 
a constructivist approach so that teachers were being taught these concepts in a way that they were 
expected to teach their students. After the initial staff development sessions, though, the 
instructional model and cooperative learning strategies were not used consistently during in-service 
institutes with teachers. 

One of the teachers described the difficulty he had with learning the new approaches and 
understandings associated with this program and how the staff-development and inservice sessions 
were rarely helpful in making a shift from old teaching approaches to new. 

They're supposed to be supportive, because they had these.. .meetings. ...It 
wasn't to me very productive because they gave us the new version of [the 
field test materials], and then we just spent [time in]. ..groups. ..just talking 
about a section.... That’s not how I learn. I have to do something... 

For example, Andrew cited cooperative learning as a particular problem area. Teachers, program 
developers, and university support staff all emphasized that effective cooperative learning strategies 
are critical to successful implementation of this science program, and one teacher spoke about how 
the most difficult change that she encountered with the reform was teaching students how to work 
in cooperative teams. Though cooperative learning was covered often during in-service sessions, 
for Andrew, it was not immediately effective in helping him adopt new beliefs and instructional 
approaches. After three years of field-testing the curriculum and attending in-services, this teacher 
spoke about how valuable a cooperative learning in-service would be as he had had no experience 
with it and his lack of knowledge of cooperative learning "affects everything I do because I don't 
feel like I'm effective with this..." He found that he had some students that just could not "work 
with others" and he tended to separate them and have them sit in desks away from the tabled teams. 

It is important to point out that Andrew's beliefs about student learning appeared to conflict 
with the beliefs necessaiy to successfully implement cooperative learning approaches in the 

O 

ERIC 



899 922 



classroom. Whereas cooperative learning fosters a belief in effective learning situations with 
heterogeneous groups of children, Andrew struggled with a perception of teaching and student 
learning that required ability grouping. Four years into the reform, Andrew came to realize that 
tracking was embedded within his belief system about student learning, that such a belief system 
conflicted with the philosophy of the reform curriculum, and as a result, the new curriculum was 
not working successfully for him or his students. As he struggled, he also clearly realized the need 
for assistance for further change. 

I've been trying for two years to take the class on cooperative [learning]. ...I 
borrowed a book to read, but that doesn't do you any good if you don't have 
people there.. ..I need to be involved.. ..I need to have it functional for me. 

He pointed to the fact that another teacher, Eric, had already had a cooperative learning class "and it 
proved very helpful" for him. Eric indicated that, indeed, a cooperative learning class had been 
helpful. 

[T]he biggest thing that has helped me out is taking a class on cooperative 
leaming....The very first year we field taught I took that class at the same 
time. So I really felt that that got me into the correct mind set of.. .what does 
it really mean to be.. .a cooperative class? 

However, as the reform curriculum was piloted in 1990, Eric was open to the science reform; 
he felt that it supported the middle school philosophy. His choice then was to immediately take a 
cooperative learning class to aid him in facilitating the changes within his science classroom. In 
contrast, Andrew was unsure about the benefits of the program and was hesitant to implement the 
curriculum in his classroom. After four years of field-testing and implementation, though, Andrew 
came to a critical place. He saw the differences between his belief system and instructional 
strategies and those of the reform and he perceived that further training in this key aspect of the 
program would be of great value to his teaching. 

Andrew enrolled in a cooperative learning class. Though participation in the class failed to 
provide him with answers to all of his questions, he began to reflect on the key social skills that 




900 



would strengthen his students' cooperative skills. His new approach contrasted with his previous 
plans to ability-group children. 

Andrew also talked about the need to have learned such instructional approaches as he 
worked with his students. Using the instructional approaches with other adults was not, in itself, 
effective. He saw that better teacher learning would have ensued had he been able to practice those 
approaches with children and had conversations regarding that practice with experts and peers. 

In sum, it appears that staff development and in-service served FSMS teachers in different 
ways. One member of the university support staff emphasizes that it is important not to "expect 
everyone to be in the same place" in the change process, "but moving along..." Therefore, it is 
critical when implementing reform to consider the amount of time teachers may need to reach 
dissonance with their long-held beliefs and approaches. It is important to ensure that support and 
staff development (through in-service, coursework, peer coaching, and university support) are 
available to them at that juncture. It cannot be said that three years of staff development necessarily 
provided enough support to bring all teachers at FSMS to a place where they could successfully 
implement an innovative curriculum. The staff development process, though, may have possibly 
placed them in a better position for change later in the implementation process. It appears that more 
and varied types of support are needed for continued teacher learning. 

For those already committed to change, in-service training aided them in further developing 
important concepts and skills necessary to successfully implement the reform curriculum in their 
classrooms. In order for continued change, additional support seems important for these teachers 
as well. (This point will be discussed further below.) 

Teacher Learning and The Practice of Field-Testing 

During a field test, teachers are not supposed to modify or adjust the curriculum activities to 
fit their style of teaching or to provide a more successful lesson based on their prior knowledge and 
teaching experience. Field-testing requires the teacher to teach the curriculum as it is written. 
Therefore, one needs to consider the impact of the "rules of the field test" on the construction of 
new teacher knowledge. Reflecting on prior knowledge and experience is a key component of 



O 

ERIC 



901 



constructivist learning (von Glasersfeld, 1992), yet teachers were required to set aside their prior 
knowledge of science teaching as they field-tested the reform curriculum. 

Most of the teachers at FSMS felt very constrained because of the this during the field test. A 
university staff member explained, 

...[M]ost of these teachers were.. .what I would call pretty good teachers... 
teachers who didn't— even when they had a traditional program— didn't just 
teach the textbook. OK, they were doing their own thing, supplementing 
it, cutting out and adding things all on their own...these are experienced 
teachers. They taught for how long and they have some knowledge and 
some background about what they think is important and activities that 
work for them. So now they're forcing this, field-testing this curriculum. 

And one of the things we tried to emphasize was that "We want this field 
test to be a field test of what's written, not necessarily a field test of how 
good a teacher you are in terms of being able to take what's written and 
adapt it". ..So in a lot of ways they felt very constrained by this. They wanted 
to take these ideas and run with them and go wherever they wanted with 
them. 

A 6th grade teacher described field-testing as "exhausting." 

[I]t was really frustrating to know that, I think we could do it better if 
we changed this. But in those first two years not feeling like I [had] the 
leeway to do any of that because I needed to teach it exactly as it was 
written so that I could give them real feedback on what they were trying 
to accomplish.. ..I was free to make suggestions at any time, but I didn't 
feel like I could do it first and then suggest. 

This possible constraint to learning was possibly mediated by the fact that program developers 
recognized "the need to treat teachers as professionals" and as "co-developers." One teacher saw 
her role as "trouble shooting. In some cases [as] nit picking." 




902 



925 



Teachers (and students) were asked to give comments and opinions regarding the curriculum, 
and some of their ideas were reflected in the second field test edition. Some teachers would retry 
activities and "give it a new twist," and they were paid for any ideas that were used in future 
materials. 

However, the field test "rules" for the teacher were explicit—they were to teach the curriculum 
as written and not draw on their personal knowledge and experience to modify the materials as 
they taught. As a result, dissonance between old and new ideas, and ultimately the construction of 
new knowledge, may have been delayed for some teachers. It may have encouraged the 
construction of dual knowledge and practice systems— "teaching as I know it" and "teaching as the 
program outlines it"— and may have ultimately facilitated some teachers' continued reliance on past 
strategies and beliefs. Some of these approaches were in evidence in various degrees in some 
classrooms in the form of quizzes, extended use of old textbooks, teacher lecturing, and 
independent seatwork. 

In addition, some of the teachers talked about how the field-test activities were poorly written 
and just did not work in their classrooms. 

It was a mess! Oh my god, that first year, it was, the book was horrendous. 

Things didn’t work. When you'd get into it.. .it was just a mess.. ..I was so 
busy trying to figure out what was going on in the book.. ..I was really upset 
with this book. It was terrible. 

[S]ome of it was very bad. Some of it didn't work. Some of it took 
forever.. ..[T]he kids couldn't understand it, and it was placed at the wrong 
level. 

Some teachers also complained about the poor quality of equipment. "They sent.. .cheap things 
that didn't work. We [had] pieces of equipment that [were] supposed to do things that would not." 

Field test instructional materials and equipment may not be the best materials to use with 
teachers who have little knowledge and understanding of the framework on which the curriculum 



is based and who feel successful with long-held teaching practices. It is unlikely that teachers will 
come to a place of dissonance and/or dissatisfaction with teaching practices that they view as 
successful and abandon these approaches for those that are not. Furthermore, it may be difficult 
for individuals to reconstruct and develop new beliefs and approaches with materials that are not 
working at their optimum. 

Teacher Learning: Communication with Others 

In the Context of Staff Development and In-service 

What seemed most valuable to teachers during the in-service sessions, were the opportunities 
they had to talk with other teachers about the problems that they were experiencing in their 
classrooms and to hear about the solutions that other teachers were employing. As students in this 
science program problem-solved and created and answered questions in cooperative group 
settings, likewise teachers constructed their own knowledge through conversations with their 
peers. Eric pointed out that 

It was probably more helpful honestly to get together with other schools... 
and just talking at lunch and saying, "Well how did this go for you?" "What 
did you do on this?" "Oh yeah that would work for me." and... exchanging 
ideas in that way I think was more valuable than some of the stuff they had us 
do....[W]e tried a few of the projects and.. .it helped seeing them the first 
time, but I think the biggest thing was just talking, being able to talk to other 
people and saying, "I had this problem with it." "Yeah, I had that too. What 
did you do to solve it?" 

During the in-services, teachers would examine new units and work through some of the 
activities in the new materials to become familiar with them and to address any possible difficulties. 
As there were the difficulties with the field test materials, some teachers valued the opportunities to 
"talk about it" and "have their say" that "it [was] not all perfect" and say "what [was] wrong." 

They needed to talk about what was going well and what was not. In these settings, teachers 
needed to be problem-solvers. At the in-service, they did such things as write their problems out 




904 



92 ? 



on 3 x 5 cards that were then shared with other teachers who would give them a "fresh 
perspective" about how they could solve their problems. 

In the Context of Working Together within FSMS 

Some of this valued communication continued to take place outside staff development 
sessions. Beginning with the first field test year, the sixth grade science teachers at FSMS formed 
a disciplinary team to plan and to coordinate their classroom activities. It worked "beautifully." 
They would "plan what they were going to do and help each other. Even within the early field test 
edition, they didn't have much [of a] problem..." As a university staff member described it, 

The three would structure time. The fact that there was somebody they could 
go and talk to.. ..Teachers that were more isolated. ..would call [university 
support personnel or the program developers but it was] not the same as 
having a colleague. [It is] very important to have somebody else you can 
communicate with. The people who got together and shared common 
concerns were less apprehensive. 

The sixth grade team attributed their working together as "invaluable" to their success in 
implementing the program. Lisa emphasized, "We wouldn’t have had nearly the success if we 
hadn't done that. I really think that we had an easier time with it than anybody else because we 
planned together." The 6th grade science team has stressed to other teachers that team planning 
would really make the change to the new program much easier. Karen pointed out that team 
planning was very helpful to her science team. 

I think that we get an awful lot from each other. I think that (other teachers) 
might find more support than they expect from each other. "Gee, this didn't 
work. What can we do?" You know, "This is a good idea, but it's not 
working." If they would do that, I think it would help. 

Their meetings, held once a week during a common planning time in the afternoon, included 
a sharing of problems, solutions, and successes. The issues discussed included: 1) the materials 
that are necessary for activities, how they are organized for best use by the students, and the 



possible problems that can arise with them, 2) how to structure the class for different activities (i.e. 
teams, size of teams, whole class activities), 3) the modifications to the student text needed to aid 
students, to simplify the task, or to make the approach to the task more sensible and/or organized, 
4) the students' approaches to learning and the successes and obstacles that students experience, 5) 
the various instructional strategies individual teachers are using (i.ei, modeling), 6) the time frames 
needed for various activities, 7) the methods of student assessment, 8) the sharing of teacher 
preparation tasks (i.e., locating, acquiring, and copying materials), 9) the science content, and 10) 
the role of the teacher and the role of the student. 

As a new member of the sixth grade science team, Rhonda felt as if the support that she 
received from her science team was very helpful in making the change to her new teaching 
assignment. "[It is] easy when you have support." During team meetings, Rhonda asked 
questions like: "How long will it take me to do this?" "Should I plan one class for this reading?" 
"What did I forget?" "Do you have a problem with your kids over-watering their plants?" Her 
teacher's guide was filled with yellow sticky notes to remind her of things that were not in the 
book. They were things which Karen and Lisa had shared with her and which were based on their 
three-year experience with the program. 

Among the FSMS science staff, the sixth grade was the only grade level that team-planned its 
science. The eighth grade science teachers, though, helped each other, problem-solved, and 
shared equipment. The 7th grade teachers appeared, though, to have little communication with 
each other. 

Across grade levels, Eric and Lisa, eighth and sixth grade teachers, shared informally what 
was happening in each other's classrooms and seemed to be comfortable with their knowledge of 
each other's programs. In general, though, there appeared to be little communication, 
collaboration, or shared vision between the science teachers of the different grade levels. When 
describing the cross grade-level communication, some teachers described the situation as 
"fragmented." 



906 



929 



Reforming School Structures for Continued Change and Growth 

These science teachers perceived themselves as being "fragmented" as opposed to having a 



shared vision. It appeared that what had handicapped teachers to further develop the science 
program and extend science reform was the school and district structure. What had not occurred 
within the district to facilitate the communication, interaction, and collaboration between teachers 
was the redistribution of decision-making power from the administration to the science educators at 
FSMS. During and following the field test, decisions regarding the science program remained the 
responsibility of the district director of secondary education. Within the school, day-to-day 
decisions regarding equipment and supplies continued to be made by the department chair, a long- 
time resistor to the reform. 

Importantly, district and school structures and policies conflict with the philosophy of this 
reform. In the reform, the role of the teacher in the classroom changes from the major source of 
information and the transmitter of that information to a facilitator or coach who engages and 
encourages students to explore and form their own explanations. The same kind of role change 
needed to occur with regards to the administration and the teaching staff at FSMS. Administrators 
needed to be facilitators and coaches, where they engaged and encouraged science faculty to 
problem-solve, inquire, and communicate with each other in cooperative and collaborative teams 
and with other teachers and experts outside their school so that they could further develop effective 
classroom strategies and approaches, set program goals, and develop new assessments. 

Without forums for communication and new decision-making structures, these middle school 
science teachers were without means to develop a unified direction for further change and growth. 
Such structures, such as grade-level science teams (like the sixth grade team) and science faculty 
councils, would provide teachers with opportunities to continue the valuable dialogue and learning 
that took place during in-service institutes during the field test. Without such forums and 
structures, further teacher learning and program developments are impeded and full implementation 
of the reform becomes uncertain. 




ERIC 



907 



Summary 



Key to constructivist learning for students is the need to communicate as they work through 
the process of scientific problem solving and inquiry. Students can verbalize their beliefs 
regarding problems and solutions, which provides them with opportunities to understand their 
ideas and those of others more clearly and to see inconsistencies in their thinking (von Glasersfeld, 
1992). Working with others also allows for scaffolding of thinking between group members in 
order to complete complicated tasks, answer questions, and solve problems (Resnick, 1992). In 
addition, Resnick (1992) points out that social interaction is important to the development of 
thinking skills in that it provides opportunities for individuals to model and observe thinking 
strategies— how one analyzes and approaches a problem and puts together arguments. 

Important to consider here is that as these approaches are necessary for student learning, they 
are also critical to teacher learning. The state Department of Education includes "teachers as well as 
students" in their curricular standards for a "transformed science program." Teachers and students 
must work in open systems. They need to "work together in groups and teams," "communicate 
effectively," persevere in long term investigation," and "apply what they learn to authentic needs 
within their communities." These practices apply not only to the learning of science and 
technology, but also to the learning of new teaching and learning philosophies and instructional 
approaches. It appears, though, that with the conclusion of the field test, a "closed system" 
emerged where communication between science teachers at FSMS and between these teachers and 
outside support personnel is neither supported nor encouraged. 

As the valued opportunities for teacher learning through communication and collaboration 
with others diminished after the field test, teachers were isolated from many situations and 
individuals important to their personal learning and their professional growth. Beliefs about the 
processes for teacher learning need to be consistent with beliefs about the ways in which students 
learn. Therefore communication, cooperative interactions, and collaboration between teachers are 
critical to the future development of their learning and teaching. 




908 



Su pport for Staff Development 

It is valuable to examine the environment systemically, as "a combination of endeavors that 
relate to each other and in combination have a significant impact in the context in which change is 
being sought" (Anderson & Mitchener, 1994, p. 36). It is important to be attentive to the context of 
staff development (Sparks & Loucks-Horsley, 1990) as factors there may work against teacher 
learning of innovative ways to teach (Borko & Putnam, 1996). 

It requires attention to organizational and political considerations. Actions 
taken at the national, state, district, school, and classroom levels.. .can interact 
to support change in a common direction, or they can counteract each other in 
such a manner that change is defeated. And even though all actions taken are 
complementary, there is the possibility that the omission of some particular 
action or actions could stall what would otherwise be a successful reform 
effort. A vision of what should be must be combined with a systemic process 
of working toward that vision (Anderson et al., 1994, p. 4). 

In addition to the structural factors discussed in the previous section, the following discussion 
serves to address the contextual factors critical to teacher learning at this site. 

Administrative Support 

The administration's support for the reform was evident in 1) the strong push to implement 
the reform curriculum, 2) the support of hands-on, activity-based classrooms, 3) the release time 
provided teachers for in-service and staff development and the support of an electronic bulletin 
board during the field test years, 4) the purchase of the published curriculum materials, and 5) the 
acknowledgment for the need for congruency between state assessment and the district's 
philosophy in science education. 

The district administration's vision for the future was one of breadth, as it included the 
implementation of science reform curricula initially at the middle school level, but then later at the 
elementary and the high school levels, thus securing consistency in philosophy throughout the 
district. Importantly, the initial support of the administration was a critical factor in the 




909 



932 



implementation of the science reform curriculum at FSMS. Despite the high interest for the reform 
on the part of some of the science teachers, there was so much resistance from others, that without 
the strong administrative push, it seems highly unlikely that the program would have been 
implemented. However, as a result of this top down approach, some teachers felt that they were 
not given any choice whether to participate in the field test or not ("we had to do it.") which 
resulted in some negative feelings towards the reform and some teachers remaining resistant to the 
change. The top-down strategy thus served as a door opening agent for implementation, but also 
served as an obstacle to the change process. 

Sparks and Loucks-Horsley (1990) report research that indicates that where top-down 
policies establish the direction and expectations within a school district, a supportive environment 
for teacher change requires involvement by teachers in formulating goals. Yet, as the field test 
ended, the district administration did not give teachers support, encouragement, or the power to 
make decisions and to take on responsibility for setting program goals in depth, developing further 
instructional strategies, and developing new classroom and district assessments. Administrative 
support weakened in that teacher opportunities for learning through staff development and through 
communication and collaboration greatly decreased. 

Support from Program Developers and University Support Staff 

Communication between the teachers and the program developers occurred not only through 
staff development and in-service meetings, but also through an electronic bulletin board. Though 
the bulletin board continued at the program developers' headquarters, one teacher complained that 
the school removed their modem after the field test. Teachers with "this doesn't work" situations 
then needed to contact the program developers indirectly through an 800 number with the publisher 
or by writing the program developers directly. 

The university (SU) provided important support in the context of in-service education. 
University support staff would also pay regular visits to FSMS and visit with teachers in their 
classrooms during the field test. They would meet with teachers and ask "how's it going" and give 




910 



933 



help. When the field test was complete, this supportive framework was lost due to the end of 
funding. 

State Support 

Under the leadership of a new State Commissioner of Education and the progressive vision 
of a state legislature, the State Department of Education began to develop science outcomes for the 
schools throughout the state just as the faculty of FSMS began to field-test the science reform 
curriculum. As one reviews the state's mission statement for science education and its statement of 
philosophy, one would think that the state's writers had at some point collaborated closely with the 
writers of the reform curriculum. The mission statement reads: "The mission of science education 
in [the state] is to develop all students into life long learners who are reasoned decision makers..." 

The science education standards for the state paralleled the learning goals and instructional 
approaches of the reform. Further, the state described the characteristics of quality science 
instruction as including: 

— teaching consistent with the nature of scientific inquiry 
— beginning concept development with questions, events, or phenomena that are 
interesting and familiar to students 
— engaging learners actively 

— using team approach and cooperative learning techniques 
— de-emphasizing lower level memorization skills and emphasizing the higher level 
thinking skills 

— insisting on quality communication 
— concentrating on the collection and use of evidence 

— valuing respect, risk-taking, equity (gender and ethnicity), and inquiry in the 
classroom... 

Though the state's development of reform standards was congruent with the science reform 
curriculum implemented at FSMS, it was not the impetus for the reform. The state did not dictate 
change for the Lincoln County schools. They happened simultaneously in conjunction with 



i'O 




911 



national movements for change. State administrators hope that new state assessments that are 
focused on process science will "drive" problem-solving instruction. They talk about how "people 
assess what they value" and by assessing students for the development of process skills, state 
educators will begin to teach process science. 

Conclusion 

What needs to be considered in order to support teachers' learning of new and innovative 
teaching practices? Borko and Putnam (1996) present the following features important to 
successful learning experiences for teachers that are consistent with the facets of constructivist * 
learning. They include: 

•addressing teachers' preexisting knowledge and beliefs about teaching, 
learning, learners, and subject matter; 

•providing teachers with sustained opportunities to deepen and expand their 
knowledge of subject matter [and here I would include their knowledge of 
learning and teaching]; 

•grounding teachers' learning and reflection in classroom practice; and 
•offer ample time and support for reflection, collaboration, and continued 
learning, (p. 701) 

It is important that teachers have a belief in and a good understanding of the reform's 
philosophy, the curriculum's instructional model, and the program's teaching strategies in order to 
teach the program effectively in their classrooms. Some teachers at FSMS came into the field test 
with a better understanding of the program's key concepts, strategies, and skills than did others. 
These teachers viewed this program as a much desired vehicle to help them implement new 
instructional approaches. For these educators, the field test materials and the staff development 
institutes provided them with teaching strategies and instructional materials that they had long 
sought on their own. These teachers had already been on this pathway and the reform supported 
their long-time personal endeavors for change. 




912 



935 



However, other teachers did not come with this background knowledge and experience. For 
some, the science reform curriculum was quite a departure from what they normally did in their 
classrooms. In addition, they felt that they were successful in their teaching, saw little reason to 
change their teaching practices, and were uncertain, unconvinced, and resistant to the new 
curriculum. Yet, for them, the program implementation and its concurrent staff development and 
in-service served as an opportunity for professional growth-knowledge could be gleaned about the 
program and long-held beliefs were recognized and possibly challenged. 

The National Center for Research on Teacher Education (1991) points out that if educators are 
going to be effectively assisted in adopting innovative programs, they need 1) a chance to think 
about why innovative methods are better than more traditional practices, 2) examples of such 
methods, and 3) an opportunity to "experience.. .firsthand" the approaches as learners. 

Considering this, staff development and in-service workshops were valuable to some teachers as 
they were able to experience first hand the activities and approaches of the program. Yet some 
teachers felt that it was not enough to only experience these instructional approaches with other 
teachers; it would have been more valuable to have used and practiced these strategies with 
students in the classroom and to have had immediate support and feedback from peers and/or 
experts in that context. 

It is important to teach "teachers as learners in a manner consistent with the program's vision 
of how teachers should treat students as learners" (Borko & Putnam, 1996, p. 701). As teachers 
were presented with the framework of the reform and the instructional strategies of the curriculum, 
program developers used the same pedagogical approaches with teachers that the teachers were 
expected to use with their middle school students. Yet program developers and administrators 
need to carefully consider providing support for teachers over longer periods of time as some 
educators did not reach dissonance with long-held beliefs until later into the reform. 

In addition, as students worked in cooperative teams to ask questions, generate solutions, 
test out ideas, resolve problems, and construct new ideas, the same learning process held true for 
teachers as they met to discuss the workings and failures of the new curriculum they were

implementing. Communication between teachers, university support personnel, and program 
developers appeared to be a key component to teacher learning and to facilitating the 
implementation of this reform curriculum. What seemed to be of most value to the teachers in this 
study were the opportunities they had in the contexts of staff development institutes and in-service 
education to talk with other teachers about the problems they were experiencing and to hear and to 
talk about the solutions that other teachers were utilizing. It was in these settings that teachers 
could share and build on each other's ideas and could examine diverse approaches to the problems 
they were experiencing in their classrooms. 

Of special interest and importance is that these learning contexts for teachers paralleled the 
learning contexts provided for students in the reform curriculum. For both students and teachers in 
this science program, the social construction of knowledge through cooperative and collaborative 
interactions appeared to be critical to overall learning. The state Board of Education indicated that 
for both teachers and students "communicating effectively" and "working together in groups and 
teams" were key characteristics of a "transformed science program" the goal of which was to 
develop teachers and students into "lifelong learners." 

However, these learning contexts greatly diminished when the field test ended and its 
structure was no longer in place. The sixth grade science team still remained in constant and 
supportive dialogue and there was some communication between eighth grade teachers, but in 
general, teachers found themselves quite isolated from teachers in other grade levels and from 
individuals with expertise outside their school. This greatly impacted their further learning and 
development as teachers as well as the further development of the science reform within their 
school. Most science teachers continued to experience some frustration with aspects of the 
program-some more than others. Some educators were just beginning to experience dissonance 
between their long-held teaching beliefs and the underlying framework of this reform. Also, 
critically, there was no unified vision for the further development of this reform within the school. 
Teachers held individual goals and objectives that were valuable, but they acknowledged that as a 
faculty, they were "fragmented." Communication opportunities and new decision-making

structures, such as science teams, needed to be created, encouraged, and supported so that teachers 
could further develop instructional strategies, assessments, and future goals of the reform. 

Important to consider when reflecting on teacher learning, is the frustration felt by the 
teachers as they implemented field test materials as they were written. Within the framework of the 
field test, teachers were asked to set prior knowledge and experience aside, not modify curriculum 
activities, and teach the pilot materials as they were written. Following constructivist learning 
theory, their personal learning may have been hampered by these field test "rules," and dual belief 
systems may have been developed. 

Change can be a difficult and complex process. Importantly, science teachers at FSMS 
differed greatly in how much they incorporated the program's key features into their classrooms 
after four years of staff development and working with a new curriculum. What is difficult and 
complex about incorporating reform in science classrooms is coming to recognize and understand 
the many factors, including the ways and practices that support teacher learning, that are critical to 
its success and to have knowledge of the obstacles that can inhibit its progress. With such 
knowledge and understanding, we can then foster action that will support the change and, 
importantly, address the limiting factors. In sum, change is, indeed, a long and intricate process 
and it needs continued nurturance, sustenance, and support in order to persevere.
