Latino Immigrant Students’ School Experiences 
in the United States: The Importance of Family- 
School-Community Collaborations 

Erin Sibley and Kalina Brabeck 
Abstract 

This paper reviews the literature on the educational experiences of Lati¬ 
no immigrant students in the United States, from early childhood through 
postsecondary educational attainment. Utilizing a developmental-contextual 
perspective, we explain the various environmental, political, structural, and 
psychological challenges these students face, while also highlighting protec¬ 
tive factors in the school and family. We highlight how schools, communities, 
and families can work together to improve the educational chances of these 
students. These students are less likely to receive high-quality early childhood 
education and care before the age of five, setting the stage for potential ac¬ 
ademic disadvantage later on. Parental premigration characteristics play an 
important role in children’s achievement during elementary and middle school, 
a time when parent educational involvement is important but often difficult 
for immigrant families. Immigrant students are less likely to graduate high 
school compared to children of native-born parents and during adolescence 
may experience isolation from U.S. peer groups. These findings are discussed 
in light of the additional risks carried by unauthorized status, as well as im¬ 
migration and acculturation-related stressors. Given that these children are a 
growing segment of the U.S. population and will soon comprise a large por¬ 
tion of the nation’s workforce, we argue that educating them effectively should 
be of utmost importance. We conclude with policy recommendations, practice 
recommendations for schools, and important directions for future research.

Introduction 

There are currently 41.3 million immigrants living in the United States 
(U.S.), 11.7 million of whom are unauthorized (Passel, Cohn, & Gonzales- 
Barrera, 2013; Zong & Batalova, 2015). Latino immigrants make up 47% 
of the foreign-born population (Motel & Patten, 2011), and demographers 
predict that by 2020, 30% of all U.S. children will be children of immigrants 
(Capps, Fix, Ost, Reardon-Anderson, & Passel, 2004; Note: Throughout this 
article, “immigrant” refers to first-generation immigrant youth and children 
of immigrants.) This article will summarize the literature on perhaps the most 
important setting outside the family that will influence the development of 
these youngest members of immigrant families—school, and it will address 
the ways in which schools can be places of connection and belonging for im¬ 
migrant children and youth, particularly when those schools effectively partner 
with families and the community. This article (a) reviews risk and protective 
factors for immigrant youth; (b) explains the social ecological model of im¬ 
migrant child development, which underscores the impact of various levels of 
context (including school and family) in influencing developmental trajecto¬ 
ries; (c) summarizes research on immigrant students’ educational experiences 
from preschool through secondary school; and (d) offers recommendations 
for building strong family—school—community partnerships for immigrant stu¬ 
dents. Throughout the article, the heterogeneity in school experiences among 
immigrant students of different legal statuses (their own and their parents) will 
be highlighted. 

Protective and Risk Factors for Immigrant Children 

Despite significant obstacles experienced by many immigrants, and notwith¬ 
standing the vast heterogeneity across and within Latino immigrant groups, 
newcomer parents often bring strengths that are conveyed to their children in 
ways that can positively affect school performance and can be harnessed in de¬ 
veloping partnerships among schools, families, and communities. For example, 
many Latino immigrant parents, families, and children demonstrate consider¬ 
able resilience, that is, the capacity to survive physically and psychologically 
in circumstances requiring strengths and determination, and to possess the 
psychological flexibility to adapt to a new lifestyle (Carreon, Drake, & Bar¬ 
ton, 2005; Trueba, 1999). In Latino families, cultural norms and values that 


138 


IMMIGRANT STUDENTS AND COLLABORATION 


emphasize family obligations, warmth, and reciprocity ( familismo ) and strong 
connections with others ( personalismo) may provide Latino immigrant children 
with an abundance of high-quality relationships with immediate and extended 
family and friends; such relationships can act as a buffer to the negative effects 
of poverty (Lansdale, Hardie, Oropesa, & Hillemeier, 2015). Children in Lati¬ 
no immigrant families are more likely to live in two-parent households, which 
has positive effects on children’s educational outcomes (Hernandez, Denton, 
& Macartney, 2008). Research has also highlighted cognitive benefits of multi¬ 
lingualism, such as higher levels of executive functioning, including attentional 
control and cognitive flexibility (Bialystok, 1999). 

Despite these individual and environment-level protective factors, Latino 
immigrant children are more likely to experience several risk factors when com¬ 
pared with nonimmigrant children, and these risk factors put them in jeopardy 
of poor academic performance (Lahaie, 2006). For example, children in immi¬ 
grant families are 1.5 times more likely than children in U.S.-born families to 
grow up poor; 26% live in a linguistically isolated household, where no adult 
speaks English well (Hernandez & Cervantes, 2011); and nearly one-third of 
children in immigrant families have a mother who has not graduated from high 
school (Hernandez & Napierala, 2012). Children in immigrant families are 
generally more likely to attend underresourced schools (Suarez-Orozco, Bang, 
& Onaga, 2010), and immigrant youth are also more likely than nonimmi¬ 
grant youth to attend larger, more segregated schools, with a higher proportion 
of students in poverty and with more safety problems at the school (Crosnoe, 
2005). As a result of these risk factors, and in spite of their high academic 
aspirations and strengths, immigrant children are less likely to be proficient 
in reading and math, attend prekindergarten, and graduate from high school 
(Hernandez & Napierala, 2012). Given their particular strengths (e.g., family 
relationships) and sources of risk (e.g., poverty), effective partnerships among 
schools, families, and communities are especially critical for these students. 

A Social Ecological Frame for Immigrant Children’s Experiences 

Bronfenbrenner’s bioecological theory, originally published as ecologi¬ 
cal theory in the 1970s, posits that children are embedded within multiple 
contexts that interact with each other to affect the child’s development (Bron- 
fenbrenner & Morris, 1998). Through this lens, the contexts of the family, 
school, and community influence child development and are interactive sites 
where various processes (e.g., parenting styles, teacher perceptions), influence 
the child’s development. Moreover, this theory stresses the influence of the 
interactions among layers of context on child development, such as the com¬ 
munication between parents and teachers or the follow-through at home with 
school-assigned tasks. 


139 


SCHOOL COMMUNITY JOURNAL 


As members of underrepresented and oppressed groups, additional eco¬ 
logical constructs are important to Latino immigrant children’s development. 
Extending Bronfenbrenner’s work and recognizing the limitations of tradi¬ 
tional developmental models for understanding the unique experiences and 
environments of children of color, Garcia Coll and colleagues (1996) devel¬ 
oped the integrative model for the study of developmental competencies in 
minority children. This model includes a greater emphasis on social position, 
racism, and segregation, since these constructs may influence the inhibiting or 
promoting environments in which children live. The integrative model further 
considers that different racial and ethnic groups have different adaptive cul¬ 
tures, depending on the migration patterns of the group, level of acculturation, 
and cultural values and traditions. 

In line with these ideas, school, home, and community environments can 
act as inhibiting or promoting settings for the optimal development of im¬ 
migrant children. As argued by Ungar and colleagues (2012), children exist 
within environments that either support and buffer them from risk factors or 
heighten those risk factors. According to the Ungar (2012) model, resilience 
should be understood as both the quality of the interaction between the child 
and his or her environment, as well as the individual competence of both the 
child and the environment, separately. In this view, a well-resourced, stable en¬ 
vironment, such as a high-quality school, allows the child’s internal strengths 
and talents to contribute to positive educational outcomes. Importantly, Ungar 
and colleagues also argue that “the more a child is exposed to adversity...the 
more the child’s resilience depends on the quality of the environment (rather 
than individual qualities)” to ensure his or her well-being (Ungar, Ghazinour, 
& Richter, 2013, p. 350). Consequently, an underresourced environment may 
inhibit the expression of a child’s internal resources. Given the many risk fac¬ 
tors immigrant children may face, it is paramount that educational settings 
partner with families and communities to promote environments that support 
the children’s development. 

Differences in Student Experiences Based on Legal Status 

The current U.S. legal and political climate acts as an inhibiting environ¬ 
ment for many Latino immigrant children, in particular for those whose lives 
are constrained by their own or their parents’ liminal legal status. It is estimated 
that 4.5 million U.S.-born children live in mixed-status families, consisting of 
at least one unauthorized parent and a U.S.-born citizen child (Taylor, Lopez, 
Passel, & Motel, 2011). These children live within the context of social exclu¬ 
sion that dominates the lives of their unauthorized parents (Brabeck, Sibley, 
& Lykes, 2016; Capps, Bachmeier, Fix, & Van Hook, 2013; Suarez-Orozco, 


140 


IMMIGRANT STUDENTS AND COLLABORATION 


Yoshikawa, Teranishi, & Suarez-Orozco, 2011). For example, unauthorized 
immigrants are less likely than authorized immigrants to access social services 
(Xu & Brabeck, 2012), partly due to their ineligibility to access services for 
themselves, but also explained by a reluctance to access services for their U.S. 
citizen children due to fear, mistrust, and misunderstanding of social services 
(Viladrich, 2012). Fear and stigma characterize the everyday lives of unau¬ 
thorized immigrants (Abrego, 2011), and the combination of minority status, 
potentially traumatic premigration experiences, poverty, and lack of legal sta¬ 
tus pose significant mental health risks to this population (Perez & Fortuna, 
2005). There are also one million unauthorized children under the age of 18 
living in the U.S.; these children experience educational and employment con¬ 
straints and the risk of their own deportation and subsequent separation from 
their families (Passel & Cohn, 2011). 

Parents’ documentation status can affect their children both directly (such 
as in the case of a parent who is deported) and indirectly through their premi¬ 
gration characteristics, postmigration experiences, and every day social settings 
(Yoshikawa & Kalil, 2011). Some immigrant parents, for example, incur high 
levels of migratory debt after paying smugglers to help them to come to the 
U.S. and are forced to take on multiple inflexible jobs, which can limit the 
time they have to invest in their children’s educational pursuits (Yoshikawa, 
2011). The pervasive stress of unauthorized status can create immense parental 
distress, which may affect children through harsher parenting and less parental 
warmth and authoritative parenting (Yoshikawa & Kalil, 2011). Research that 
explores how legal status influences immigrant students’ experiences in school 
will be integrated into the summaries that follow. 

Early Childhood 

Many children in Latino immigrant families begin kindergarten at a dis¬ 
advantage due to their lower rates of enrollment in center-based child care 
(Brandon, 2004). Fligh-quality, center-based care—including daycare cen¬ 
ters, Head Start programs, and other prekindergarten programs—are generally 
regarded as optimal to promote child social/emotional well-being and cogni¬ 
tive development. Unlike some other childcare options (e.g., home daycare, 
relative care), quality center-based care settings have trained staff, varied educa¬ 
tional curricula, daily structure, and peers with whom children can engage in 
learning. Researchers have found that quality center-based care, compared to 
parent or informal home-based care, supports early reading and numeracy skills 
(Gormley, Gayer, Phillips, & Dawson, 2005; Loeb, Bridges, Bassok, Fuller, & 
Rumberger, 2007) as well executive functioning (Weiland & Yoshikawa, 2013). 


141 


SCHOOL COMMUNITY JOURNAL 


Research indicates that children of immigrants are less likely to be enrolled 
in high-quality early care and preschool compared to children of U.S.-born 
citizens (Brandon, 2004; Crosnoe, 2007; Magnuson, Lahaie, & Waldfogel, 
2006). The majority of immigrant children under age three are either in pa¬ 
rental care or have no regular care arrangement (60% compared to 40% of 
children of U.S. citizens), and only 5% are enrolled in center-based care (Mat¬ 
thews & Ewen, 2006). This may be in part due to the findings that children 
of immigrants are more likely to live in low-income households, have parents 
with less formal education, and be less likely to have two working parents, all 
factors associated with lower enrollment in preschool and center-based care 
(Capps et ah, 2004). Additionally, Latino immigrant parents working low- 
wage jobs are more likely to work nontraditional shifts, such as night shifts, 
and do not have high-quality childcare options available during those hours 
(Matthews & Ewen, 2006). 

Recent research indicates that home-visiting programs for families with 
young children may be effective with immigrant populations. For example, 
Nievar and colleagues (2011) found that the Home Instruction of Parents and 
Preschool Youngsters (HIPPY) program increased immigrant parents’ effica¬ 
cy and contributed to richer home learning environments. Positive effects on 
math achievement were observed through third grade. Other scholars have also 
encouraged the use of two-generation strategies with immigrant parents and 
their children through programs such as HIPPY and Abriendo Puertas (Moore 
et ah, 2014) because they help parents learn how to become teachers at home, 
bridge home and school, and often build stronger connections between fami¬ 
lies and communities (Crosnoe, 2010). 

Upon entering kindergarten, disparities in school readiness also exist be¬ 
tween children in immigrant and nonimmigrant families. Crosnoe (2007) 
found that lower center-based care usage by Mexican immigrant families par¬ 
tially explained their lower rates of math achievement in kindergarten. Using 
a national sample, Koury and Votruba-Drzal (2014) found that children of 
Mexican, Central American, and Spanish Caribbean parents performed worse 
than other immigrant groups and worse than native-born White students in 
math and reading skills at age five; these differences were primarily driven by 
socioeconomic factors. At kindergarten entry, children of foreign-born parents 
also have significantly lower expressive language scores compared to U.S.-born 
parents (W. Han, Lee, & Waldfogel, 2012). Research indicates that when chil¬ 
dren of immigrants attend center-based preschool programs, they have better 
reading and math scores at kindergarten entry and higher English-language 
proficiency (Magnuson et ah, 2006), lending credence to the importance of 
preschool enrollment.

IMMIGRANT STUDENTS AND COLLABORATION 


Research provides evidence of the role of parent legal status in partly ac¬ 
counting for the early childhood disparities reviewed. In a study of families 
with children up to 24 months old, Yoshikawa, Godfrey, and Rivera (2008) 
found that immigrant groups with the highest proportion of unauthorized par¬ 
ents (Mexican and Dominican immigrants) had the least access to institutional 
resources such as checking accounts, savings accounts, credit cards, and driver’s 
licenses. Low levels of access to these resources predicted more economic hard¬ 
ship and more parental psychological distress, which in turn were associated 
with lower scores on child cognitive outcomes. Additionally, Mexican immi¬ 
grant parents, who were most likely to be unauthorized, reported the lowest 
levels of cognitively stimulating activities at home. 

Elementary and Middle School 

Middle childhood (ages 6-12), beginning in the elementary school years, 
marks the first time that some children spend significant time outside of the 
immediate family context (Garda Coll & Marks, 2009). There is some evi¬ 
dence that although children of Latino immigrants enter school with lower 
levels of academic skills, they make up some ground over time; however, the 
gap between third-plus generation students and children of immigrants does 
not disappear (Crosnoe & Lopez Turley, 2011). Research with a national sam¬ 
ple indicates that at third grade, children of immigrants still underperform in 
math compared to children of U.S.-born parents, despite heterogeneity de¬ 
pending on country of origin (Click & Hohmann-Marriott, 2007). 

Among children of documented immigrants, parental premigration charac¬ 
teristics are strongly correlated with children’s achievement, more so than any 
other pre- or postmigration characteristic. Using data from the New Immigrant 
Survey, Pong and Landale (2012) found that for children of immigrants ages 
6-12, premigration parental education and parental English proficiency upon 
arrival in the U.S. were strongly predictive of children’s achievement. One re¬ 
cent study found that children of unauthorized parents who were enrolled in 
Grades 2-4 scored significantly worse than children of authorized immigrants 
in reading, spelling, and math (Brabeck, Sibley, Taubin, & Murcia, 2016). So¬ 
cial service use moderated this relationship, acting as a protective buffer against 
the academic risks associated with having an unauthorized parent. 

During elementary school, parents are typically expected—by the school 
and larger society—to be involved in their children’s education. There has been 
a renewed interest in family educational involvement since the passage of the 
No Child Left Behind Act in 2001, which mandated increased parental in¬ 
volvement in schools receiving Title I funding, which was reiterated in the 
Every Student Succeeds Act in 2015. Family educational involvement can be 


143 


SCHOOL COMMUNITY JOURNAL 


defined as school-based involvement (e.g., volunteering in the classroom, at¬ 
tending PTO meetings) and home-based involvement (e.g., helping children 
with homework, family meals, provision of cognitively stimulating activities at 
home). Generally, family educational involvement has been found to be posi¬ 
tively associated with child achievement, with small to moderate effect sizes 
(Fan & Chen, 2001; Jeynes, 2003). Given the evidence of benefits of fam¬ 
ily educational involvement during elementary school, it is a potential way to 
buffer immigrant children from some of the disadvantages they face, thus im¬ 
proving their academic performance. Indeed, family educational involvement 
has been shown to be beneficial for other disadvantaged groups, such as chil¬ 
dren in poverty (Dearing, Kreider, Simpkins, & Weiss, 2006). 

Until recently, little empirical work investigated the family educational in¬ 
volvement practices of immigrant versus nonimmigrant parents. In one recent 
study, Sibley and Dearing (2014) found that the domain of greatest difference 
between immigrant and nonimmigrant parents was school-based involve¬ 
ment, with immigrant parents lagging behind. However, immigrant parents 
were highly involved outside of school and also had the highest levels of edu¬ 
cational expectations for their children. Thus, immigrant parents care deeply 
about their children’s education and want to be involved in their education, 
but likely face barriers to school involvement, such as language, transportation, 
racism, childcare, or intimidation, often based on legal status. Immigrant par¬ 
ents who are unauthorized may face the greatest barriers to family educational 
involvement, and some data support this assertion. For example, ethnographic 
research demonstrated legal status as a pervasive source of stress that infiltrated 
all aspects of participants’ lives, including involvement in children’s schools 
(Carreon et ah, 2005). Schools should also understand that Latino immigrant 
parents may be highly involved in their children’s education in ways that are 
not typically considered to be “parent involvement’’ from a White, American 
perspective. For example, a qualitative study of Latino immigrants found that 
these parents were highly involved in their children’s education through asking 
questions to others in their community about how to navigate the school sys¬ 
tem and through attending events and activities that they believed would have 
indirect positive effects on their children’s learning. As an example, some cited 
attending adult English classes so that they could demonstrate the importance 
of education to their children (Poza, Brooks, & Valdes, 2014). 

During elementary school, some immigrant children experience uninten¬ 
tional bias and discrimination from their classroom teachers (Brown, 2015). 
This can be potentially problematic, given the association between teach¬ 
er expectations and achievement for children at risk (Hinnant, O’Brien, & 
Ghazarian, 2009). In addition to being linked to poorer social/emotional and 


144 


IMMIGRANT STUDENTS AND COLLABORATION 


academic outcomes, students’ perceived discrimination is linked to higher risk 
of dropout, lower academic motivation, and decreased self-efficacy (Brown, 
2015). Discrimination can manifest itself in many ways; for example, in one 
study, immigrant elementary school students reported that teachers did not call 
on them because of their ethnicity (Brown & Chu, 2012). Students also report 
that teachers assume their English is poor when they are in fact English profi¬ 
cient, and some report that they are stereotyped as problematic students with 
behavior problems (Katz, 1999). Fortunately, students in classrooms where 
teachers understood diverse students to be a benefit rather than a burden re¬ 
ported less perceived discrimination and more positive ethnic self-identities 
(Brown & Chu, 2012). 

Thus, while findings are somewhat mixed, the general consensus is that 
the academic disadvantage experienced by immigrant children in preschool 
and at school entry is carried into their elementary school years and that this 
disadvantage is mostly explained by socioeconomic and sociostrucutral fac¬ 
tors, notably legal status and teacher prejudice that leads to low expectations. 
Protective factors such as parental involvement, high teacher expectations, and 
access to quality preschool can be buffers and enhance the academic trajectories 
for some elementary-aged Latino immigrant children. 

Immigrant Students in Secondary School 

Immigrant children are less likely to graduate from high school when com¬ 
pared with children of native-born parents (Hernandez & Napierala, 2012). 
Suarez-Orozco and colleagues (2008) longitudinal data of immigrant students 
revealed that many immigrant groups (including Latino immigrant students 
from the Dominican Republic, Mexico, and Central America) showed a down¬ 
ward trend in GPA across grades in adolescence. Adolescence is a period rife 
with important social, emotional, cognitive, and biological developmental 
changes. These changes are complicated by and take on particular meaning in 
the context of immigrant youths’ lives in ways that can affect their experienc¬ 
es in school. For example, adolescence is marked by the importance of social 
relationships, particularly with peers. Adolescents seek connection with and 
belonging to groups, even as they assert their unique and distinct identities 
(Newman, Lohman, & Newman, 2007). Within this developmental context, 
the social losses experienced by first-generation immigrant students who have 
been separated from their peer groups in countries of origin may be particu¬ 
larly difficult (Suarez-Orozco et ah, 2008). Moreover, immigrant high school 
students may experience isolation from U.S. peer groups who are different cul¬ 
turally and linguistically (Garcia Coll & Marks, 2009; Suarez Orozco et ah, 
2008). The unique stressors associated with acculturation (e.g., learning the 


145 


SCHOOL COMMUNITY JOURNAL 


language, feeling different from peers, experiences of discrimination, lacking 
a sense of belonging) and acculturative stress (i.e., difficulty adjusting to new 
culture, Berry, 2006) can be particularly challenging for immigrant adolescents 
during a developmental period when peer relationships, “fitting in,” and social 
connection are important. 

Immigration-related stressors among adolescents, including acculturation 
and acculturative stress, have been linked to internalizing symptoms (i.e., de¬ 
pression, anxiety, somatic symptoms) and externalizing behaviors (i.e., negative 
behaviors directed toward the external environment) among immigrant adoles¬ 
cents (Alegrfa, Sribney, Woo, Torres, & Guarnaccia, 2007). Sirin et al. (2013) 
recently reported longitudinal data that demonstrated that greater exposure 
to acculturative stress among immigrant high school students—regardless of 
generation status—predicted significant internalizing symptoms, including 
depression, anxiety, and somatization. These internalizing symptoms are as¬ 
sociated with impaired executive functioning skills in adolescents, which in 
turn affect performance in school (G. Han et al., 2016). Additionally, during 
a developmental period when family relationships can already be tumultuous, 
acculturative family distancing, that is, the more rapid adjustment to a new 
culture of the youth vis-a-vis the parent, can add stress to family relationships 
and affect youths’ mental health and well-being in ways that compromise their 
executive functioning skills that are required for success in school (Hwang & 
Wood, 2009). 

As in their younger years, immigrant high school students also dispropor¬ 
tionately contend with structural challenges to their schooling. When compared 
to their nonimmigrant peers, they are more likely to live in urban areas where 
they face additional challenges such as underresourced schools, underprepared 
teachers, violence, segregation, poverty, parental unemployment, and crowded 
housing (Reardon-Anderson, Capps, & Fix, 2002). English-language learning 
students—typically first- and sometimes second-generation immigrants—are 
underrepresented in high-track courses in high school (Callahan, Wilkin¬ 
son, & Muller, 2010; Kanno & Cromley, 2013) and have limited access to 
advanced-level classes such as honors and advanced placement (AP) courses 
(Callahan, 2005; Callahan et al., 2010). Similar to students in the general 
population, the consequences of low tracking for ELLs include low academic 
outcomes (Calla al., 2010), lack of opportunity for developing critical think¬ 
ing skills, and disruptive classroom climates (Harklau, 1994a, 1994b). Because 
they are segregated, high school ELLs may also be hampered by the inhibition 
of second-language development (Kanno & Kangas, 2014). 

As with other developmental stages, one important structural disadvantage 
for some immigrant high school students is legal status. Unauthorized high 


146 


IMMIGRANT STUDENTS AND COLLABORATION 


school students face significant legal, financial, and policy barriers to pursuing 
education beyond high school, which can lead them to academically disengage 
and underperform (Contreras, 2009; Olivos & Mendoza, 2009; Perez, Cortes, 
Ramos, & Coronado, 2010; Perez, Espinoza, Ramos, Coronado, & Cortes, 
2009; Roth & Grace, 2015). Nationally, 40% of unauthorized adults ages 18— 
24 do not complete high school, and only 49% of unauthorized high school 
graduates go to college (Passel & Cohn, 2009). Among the small percentage of 
unauthorized immigrant students who pursue higher education, most attend 
community colleges, and many of those do not finish (Flores, 2010). 

Adolescence marks a period when individuals assert independence, define 
identity, and begin to develop a life course through acts such as obtaining a 
drivers license, applying to college, and developing a vocational path (Erikson, 
1963; Gonzalez, Suarez-Orozco, & Dedios-Sanguineti, 2013). For unauthor¬ 
ized students, these acts may be impossible because their options for work and 
education are limited by state laws (Abrego, 2006; Abrego & Gonzales, 2010). 
As described by Gonzalez (2011), high school is often a time of “discovery” for 
unauthorized students who for the first time may confront the crippling im¬ 
plications of their status and the extinction of their hopes and dreams; such 
realizations can lead to depression, anger, and even thoughts of suicide. While 
no federal law prohibits unauthorized students from obtaining a college edu¬ 
cation, most states do not offer them in-state tuition, and some states deny 
them financial assistance (Diaz-Strong, Gomez, Luna-Duarte, & Meiners, 
2011). Thus, while immigrant students in general may hold higher academic 
aspirations than their peers (Garcia Coll & Marks, 2009), unauthorized high 
school students, faced with multiple structural barriers, hold lower aspirations. 
McWhirtley, Ramos, and Medina (2013) found that high school immigrant 
students who anticipated immigration status problems had lower vocational 
outcome expectations and anticipated more external barriers to pursuing their 
postsecondary plans. 

While research has documented the challenges Latino immigrant high 
school students face, it has also revealed protective factors that underscore the 
importance of strong connections with family and community. One important 
protective factor for Latino immigrant students in high school is social relation¬ 
ships. For example, Sirin et al. (2013) found that social support moderated the 
relationship between acculturative stress and anxious/depressed symptoms for 
immigrant high school students. Similarly, Suarez-Orozco et al. (2008) found 
that social support was particularly important for first-generation immigrant 
high school students who need help navigating new linguistic and cultural 
environments, achieving financial stability, and receiving emotional and prac¬ 
tical support. One concrete action that can lead to social support for high 


147 


SCHOOL COMMUNITY JOURNAL 


school students is participation in afterschool activities. Camacho and Fuligni 
(2015) found that participation in such activities was beneficial with regards 
to academic achievement and engagement for immigrant high school students 
across generation statuses and that it was most beneficial for first-generation 
students. Strong family relationships and parental involvement can also be pro¬ 
tective factors for high school students; for example, Mena (2011) found that 
home-based monitoring and discussion of educational experiences improved 
immigrant high school students’ intentions to complete the school year. Op¬ 
portunities for mentorship (Gonzales, 2010) and financial assistance (Flores, 
2010) can further minimize the disadvantage of unauthorized immigrant stu¬ 
dents. Finally, given the multiple structural barriers they face, sociopolitical 
development and fostering critical consciousness can be particularly protective 
for immigrant youth and can contribute to academic achievement and post¬ 
secondary expectations (Abrego, 2006; Abrego & Gonzalez, 2010; Luginbuhl, 
McWhirter, & McWhirter, 2006; Perez et ah, 2010). 

Discussion 

Latino immigrant children are a growing segment of the U.S. population, 
and understanding how to educate them effectively should be a top priority 
for the nation. As young children, Latino immigrant students often start at a 
disadvantage in part due to their lower rates of enrollment in early education 
(associated with their parents’ socioeconomic status and, for some, legal sta¬ 
tus). They may face disadvantages throughout elementary and middle school 
related to cultural barriers between the school and home as well as teacher bias 
and low expectations. They further experience social barriers and immigration- 
related stressors in high school that can affect their mental health, cognitive 
functioning, and academic performance. Despite holding high educational as¬ 
pirations and expectations, structural barriers due to their own or their parents’ 
unauthorized status, economic resources, or racism may hinder their path to¬ 
ward postsecondary education. 

Strong partnerships among schools, families, and communities are vital to 
the success of immigrant students. The family-school-community systems 
model proposed by Dearing, Sibley, and Nguyen (2015) emphasized that these 
connections require investments from all three agents in the system. Commu¬ 
nities and schools play a key role in determining the extent to which families 
are aware of opportunities to be involved at the school and can take advantage 
of educational opportunities for their children. For example, schools should be 
proactive in providing outreach to immigrant families. An action research proj¬ 
ect with teachers in primarily immigrant school districts found that holding 


148 


IMMIGRANT STUDENTS AND COLLABORATION 


parent-teacher conferences in parents’ neighborhoods (such as in a church 
hall) or extending hours for parents to meet with teachers helped eliminate 
many of the barriers facing immigrant parents (e.g., intimidation, inflexible 
employment hours; Trumbull, Rothstein-Fisch, & Hernandez, 2003). Thus, 
schools in communities with high immigrant concentrations can serve their 
community in many ways and adapt as the community’s needs change. Impor¬ 
tantly, school staff should approach family-school partnerships with Latino 
immigrant parents from a strengths-based perspective, recognizing that their 
language and cultural values will contribute positively to their children’s devel¬ 
opment. When families feel that their culture is valued and teachers reach out 
to them for input, parents often become more involved at the school and in 
their children’s education (Orozco, 2008). 

When designing classroom practices, school staff should pay particular at¬ 
tention to the cultural values of their students’ families. For example, the value 
of collectivism, which is important in Latino culture, is defined as the central¬ 
ity of the interrelatedness of the self to others, with family considered to be an 
important social resource and interdependency among family members viewed 
as paramount (Chang, 2015; Rothstein-Fisch, Greenfield, & Trumbull, 1999). 
When raising children with collectivist values, parents teach them to help oth¬ 
ers and contribute to the success of the group (Rothstein-Fisch et ah, 1999). 
Because U.S. teachers and schools tend to be individualistic, they are likely to 
value and reward students for individual accomplishments and the ability to 
focus on their own work (Trumbull, Rothstein-Fisch, Greenfield, & Quiroz, 
2001). Some strategies to foster collectivism in the classroom setting include 
placing struggling and advanced readers within the same reading groups and 
encouraging them to help each other (rather than placing all struggling stu¬ 
dents in one group and advanced readers in another) and encouraging students 
to use personal and family anecdotes in class discussions (Rothstein-Fisch et 
ah, 1999; Trumbull et ah, 2001). 

Specific case management for high-needs students, including Latino im¬ 
migrant students, should also be a priority, so that both mental health and 
academic needs can be addressed. Community school models and integrated 
student supports (see Moore et ah, 2014, for a review) can be an effective way 
to ensure that students’ academic and out-of-school needs are appropriately 
met. For example, full-service community school models that provide health 
care, academic support, mental health, and material support for families help to 
ensure that academic and nonacademic challenges (that may be caused in part 
due to out-of-school factors such as those related to poverty) can be addressed 
simultaneously. School social workers can help connect families to resources 
they are entitled to but may not know how to access. Schools should also work

directly with families when immigrant students are struggling. For example, 
for immigrant students struggling with adjustment, the Conjoint Behavioral 
Consultation (CBC) intervention is a potential resource. CBC is a partnership 
model between parents, teachers, and a school consultant (e.g., a psychologist) 
to address students’ social/emotional needs through a collaboratively construct¬ 
ed plan with methods to measure the child’s progress over time. Randomized 
trials have shown the CBC to be effective in improving home—school commu¬ 
nication (Sheridan et ah, 2013) and parent-teacher relationships (Sheridan et 
ah, 2012). This exemplary program affords immigrant parents an opportunity 
to share their culture-specific childrearing goals and methods. 

School engagement is an important predictor of achievement but has been 
found to be low among Latino youth (Brewster & Bowen, 2004). Mentor¬ 
ing programs for students have been shown to help prevent declines in school 
engagement (Holt, Bry, & Johnson, 2008). Additionally, smaller schools and 
high expectation schools have been shown to promote student engagement 
(Fredericks, Blumenfeld, & Paris, 2004). Teachers should also be trained to 
understand the important role that their support of students plays given strong 
research linking teacher-child relationship and positive behavioral engagement 
(Valeski & Stipek, 2001). This is particularly important for immigrant stu¬ 
dents who may be subject to teacher biases and prejudice based on students’ 
language, race, and socioeconomic status (Brown, 2015). 

Although much work has focused on the importance of school-family con¬ 
nections, fewer scholars have focused on the third critical factor: communities 
(Dearing et ah, 2015). Community agencies can provide material and social 
supports to schools and families, which may be especially useful to disadvan¬ 
taged students and their families. City Connects (Walsh et ah, 2014) is an 
example of a whole-child intervention that leverages both school and commu¬ 
nity supports. Site coordinators placed in each school assess the strengths and 
needs of every child across four domains: academics, health, family, and be¬ 
havior-social/emotional. Using this information, the coordinators then match 
each child with a unique set of school- and community-provided supports. 
For example, a child may receive a referral to an afterschool sports or art pro¬ 
gram; the family may receive a referral to an organization that provides basic 
needs (e.g., food, diapers); or the child may be set up with additional aca¬ 
demic supports in school. A recent study (Dearing et ah, 2016) found positive 
elfects of City Connects on the academic outcomes of first-generation immi¬ 
grant students in urban elementary schools. This intervention may have been 
particularly useful because it addressed the full set of needs facing each im¬ 
migrant student in both the school and home context (i.e., provided medical 
care for students with health issues, provided food assistance for families and 


150 


IMMIGRANT STUDENTS AND COLLABORATION 


mental health counseling for parents and children, etc.). Other whole-child 
interventions that approach student outcomes from a contextual perspective, 
addressing the family, school, and community, may be likely to have similarly 
positive outcomes. 

Future Research Directions 

There is still much that we do not know about the educational experiences 
of immigrant youth. One subset of undocumented youth—unaccompanied 
immigrant youth—have been the focus of very little research, so their academ¬ 
ic outcomes remain largely unknown. These children present a very difficult 
challenge to schools as these students often come without strong familial con¬ 
nections to ease the transition into school, high rates of exposure to stressful 
and traumatic events, complicated legal cases, low levels of English proficiency, 
and varying completion levels of formal schooling. In districts with high con¬ 
centrations of unaccompanied immigrant youth, case studies examining how 
schools and community-based organizations deal with this influx and support 
children on an individual basis would add useful data to literature at the inter¬ 
section of research and practice. 

Much more work is needed to determine specific interventions that may be 
effective for immigrant children’s achievement and growth. From a theoretical 
and empirical perspective, approaches that maximize the relationships between 
schools, families, and communities are likely to have the greatest impact on the 
educational outcomes of this population.
