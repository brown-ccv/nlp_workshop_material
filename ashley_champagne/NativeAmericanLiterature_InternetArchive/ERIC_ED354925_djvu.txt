BRAZILIAN NOVELS IN ENGLISH TRANSLATION 
Compiled by Jane Garner 

This issue of Biblionoticias is a companion to number 28 (January, 1985) , "Sampling 
of Spanish-American Novels in English Translation." The Brazilian novel has a distin- 
guished tradition reaching back to 1682, when the allegorical work, Historia de predes- . 
tinado peregrine e seu irir&o precito, written in Brazil by Alexandre de Gusmao, was 
pviblished in the mother country of Portugal. It was not until the mid-19th century, 
however, that the novel began to develop as a major genre among Brazilian writers. The 
popularity of Brazilian authors has been enhanced by the translation of their works from 
their native Portuguese into other languages, particularly English, French, German, Ital- 
ian, Russian, and Spanish. Included below is a representative group of English transla- 
tions of novels of 32 writers, ranging from Jose de Alencar, born in 1829, to Autran 
Dourado, born almost a century later (1926). Entries are in alphabetical order according 
to the surname used in the catalog of the General Libraries. All titles listed are in 
the Benson Latin American Collection (BLAG) ; however, these and other titles may be avail- 
able in other library \anits.

CULTURAL JOORHALS 

Compiled by Sonia Merubia 

This bibliography highlights the many cultural journals which are held in 
the Benson Latin American Collection. These publications are serious and sub- 
stantial in content. In most cases, the library's holdings are complete or, 
very close to Deing complete, and extend for a number of years. The subject 
matter, while not excluding literature, encompasses other disciplines as well 
and often extends beyond the country of publication. Because the emphasis 
is on breadth and depth of materials, both current and non-current titles are 
cited. Annotations concentrate on this collection's holdings unless titles 
vary in some fashion from this general description.

LATIN AMERICAN CINEMA 

Compiled by Laura Gutierrez-Witt'* 

Serious research and publication on the Latin Anierican cinema by U.S. 
scholars began in the 1960s, altnough the cinematic industry in Latin 
America began shortly after the first motion picture was shown in Paris in 
lb95. The major motion-picture proaucing countries during the early years 
were Mexico and Argentina, but the rise of the cinema in Cuba and in Brazil 
during tne 1!;^60s brought new vii^or to efforts in all countries. The 
literature therefore is Doth historical and critical, reflecting the changes 
wrought on tne cinema by political ana economic conditions. Additional 
boo;<s and journals may be found in the card catalog under: /iOVIhG-PICTURES 
—LA'iVA-A'AEniCk; MOVl:'!G-PICrUHbS~Unaividual country); MOVl^.G FICrUH£ PLiiYS.

PUBLIC HEALTH IN LATIN AMERICA 

Compiled by Donald Gibbs 

Just as public health is the result of the complex interaction of 
biological, social, political and economic forces, information sources on 
the topic are equally diverse. The following subject headings under which 
health material may be located in the Public Catalog demonstrate the wide 
variety of fields related to this discipline. PUBLIC HEALTH; HYGIENE, 
PUBLIC (pre-1980 term for public health); ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH, NUTRITION, 
MALNUTRITION, SANITATION, SOCIAL MEDICINE, HEALTH FACILITIES, HEALTH SER- 
VICES ADMINISTRATION, DRUG ABUSE, WELFARE, SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICINE, MED- 
ICAL CARE, DRUG TRADE, MEDICAL GEOGRAPHY, MEDICAL POLICY, MEDICAL PARA- 
SITOLOGY. 

The citations below provide some of the basic bibliographic and statis- 
tical sources and a sampling of recent books and current periodicals useful 
for beginning research. All of them are located in the Benson Latin

LATIN AMERICAN, CARIBBEAN, AND MEXICAN AMERICAN CURRENT AFFAIRS: 
ACCESS TO SOURCES OF INFORMATION 

Compiled by Jane Garner 

One of the most frequent 'requests in the Benson Latin American Collection is 
for information on topics of such recency that it can be supplied only by 
current newspapers and magazines. In the General Libraries, indexing of 
these newspapers and magazines is available in a variety of formats: 
computerized database, video laser disk, microform, print. A cost-recovery 
fee is charged to users accessing a computerized database (further infor- 
mation is available in the General Libraries' publications on Computer-based 
Information Services). Other formats are free. 



Following are descriptions of selected indexes and other sources, which are 
useful for research on Latin American, Caribbean, or Mexican American 
current affairs, that are available in the Benson Latin American Collection 
(BLAC), Perry-Castafleda Library (PCL), Undergraduate Library (UGL), and the 
Wasserman Public Affairs Library. Entries are organized from the most 
current to the least. Lag time is an estimated figure and generally refers 
to the difference between the dates covered in the index and the average 
time when the index is available in the General Libraries. The earliest 
date of coverage refers to the oldest index held by the General Libraries. 
Where multiple library locations are cited, holdings may vary among the 
units.

LATIN AMERICAN MAPS IN THE BENSON COLLECTION 



Compiled by Anne H, Jordan 



The major group of Latin 'American maps is the collection of 15,000 large and 
medium scale maps located in the Rare Books Reading Room of the Benson 
Collection, These do not appear in the Card Catalog or the Online Catalog, 
However, other maps, including many more specialized ones, are in atlases 
and other works which can be located through the catalogs. 



Most of the Benson maps in the Rare Books Reading Room are listed in one of 
two catalogs located there: 

Historical Map Catalog: The "M" map catalog contains entries for an older 
group of about 300 printed maps from the fifteenth to the twentieth 
centuries, with eighteenth and nineteenth centuries predominating. It 
includes geographic and reconnaissance maps, urban maps, and other items of 
historical interest. Maps are entered in the "M" catalog under the 
cartographer, with additional entries for place, title, and date—a full 
description follows. These maps may be charged out for room use at the Rare 
Books Circulation Desk, 

Recent Map Catalog: The second catalog is based on the f t a map 
collection from the Department of Geography, It brings together more recent 
maps, including topographic series in scales from 1:25,000 to Landsat 
satellite maps at 1:1,000,000, Tourist and general interest maps can be 
found with topical maps on such subjects as land use, national parks, and 
border maps, etc. Entries for about 13,000 maps are arranged alphabetically 
under the name of the country and thereunder by geographical subdivisions, 
subject, and date, with title and scale following; cataloging is ongoing. 



Use of the Benson Map Collection 




ERIC 



Map Locations: Arrangement is designed for self-service; however, staff will 
assist if needed. Map cases are in the Reading Room with maps from Mexico, 
Central America, and the West Indies on the south and those from South 
America on the north. Arrangement under country is alphabetical. Series 
maps are in drawers labeled COUNTRY— SERIES— SCALE-DATE with the index map 
filed on top. Especially fragile maps are designated "rare" and will be 
brought on request. 

Other Collections: An important group of rare Paraguayan manuscript maps 
from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries is arranged separately 
according to the list in the Calendar of the Manuel Gondra Manuscript 
Collection , by Carlos E* Castafieda and Jack Autrey Dabbs, available at the 
Rare Books Circulation Desk, Nautical charts occupy four drawers on the 
north side of the Reading Room, A list of the 425 maps is available from 
staff. Also housed in the Reading Room are some 1,500 maps removed from 
books in order to preserve them* They are arranged by call number of the 
book and may be requested at the Circulation Desk, 



Use of the Card Catalog to Locate Maps 

Maps can be found under many subject headings. First, the name of the 
country, habitation, or area, followed by MAPS alone, or by a subject 
subheading: 

PERU— MAPS 

ACAPULCO, MEXICO— MAPS 

RIO DE LA PLATA VALLEY— MAPS 

CARIBBEAN AREA— MAPS 

BAJA CALIFORNIA— ROAD MAPS 

These headings can lead to a single map or to an atlas. There are many 
atlases devoted to a single country; these are also found under COUNTRY — 
MAPS. Note: ATLASES, ARGENTINE implies the atlas was published in 
Argentina* 

Maps on a particular theme in a given location may be found either under the 
place name: 

MEXICO— POPULATION— MAPS 

MINES AND MINERAL RESOURCES— MEXICO-MAPS 
NEW MEXICO-HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY— MAPS 

or under theme: 

GEOLOGY— CENTRAL AMERICA— MAPS 
CITIES AND TOWNS— VENEZUELA— MAPS 
METEOROLOGY— VENEZUELA— MAPS 



City maps are often found in insets on maps covering a larger area. Those 
of today and of bygone eras can also be found in guidebooks and histories of 
the period: 



MEXICO—DESCRIPTION AND TRAVEL—GUIDEBOOKS 

Specialized maps can be located by looking under the desired format: 

AERONAUTICAL CHARTS—LATIN AMERICA 
NAUTICAL CHARTS— SANTO DOMINGO 

Very often, useful maps can be located by reading the illustration statement 
on the catalog cards for books on the specific topic of interest, "Maps", 
"col, maps", etc, indicate the presence of maps in the book.

LIBERATION THEOLOGY IN LATIN AMERICA 

Compiled by Penny Frere 

"Liberation theology is an interpretation of Chri3tian faith out of 
the suffering, struggle and hope of the poor, a critique of society 
and the ideologies sustaining it, and a critique of the activity 
of the church and of Christians from the angle of the poor*" Phillip 
Berryman, Liberation Theology , p, 6 * (see below) 



The best introduction to liberation theology in Latin America is found in 
books on the subject or chapters of books on Latin American social or 
economic issues^ More in-depth treatment is found in the works of Catholic 
and Protestant theologians from Latin America, North America and Europe^ 
The titles and sources listed below represent only a selected number of 
items available at the Benson Collection, Other important works may be

NO. 48, REVISED NOVEMBER, 1992 Editor: Ann Hartness 



FEMINIST PERIODICALS IN LATIN AMERICA 



Compiled by Aim6e Algier Baxter 
Revised by Ann Hartness 



The Afto Intemacional de la Mujer, a program held in Mexico City in 1975, created a great awareness of the 
need for in-depth empirical research on women, particularly on women in Third World countries 
Subsequently, the United Nations initiated la D6cada de la Mujer, sometimes referred to as El Decenio de 
la Mujer (1976-1985), for the purpose of promoting research. Excellent studies of Latin American women 
with regard to education, labor, the family, women's history, legal rights, and political participation 
proliferated. As a result of the movenrwnt to study women, many Utin American feminist periodicals 
emerged. 



BIBLIOGRAPHY 

Colecci6n comunlcacl6n alternativa de la mujer. Santiago de Chile: Unidad de Comunicaci6n 
Altemativa de la Mujer, ILET, n.d. 

The most up-to-date and exhaustive bibliographic source for Latin American feminist joumals. It seeks

annotated bibliography of Latin American feminist joumals, giving scope and content for each. 
"Publicaciones p6riodicas aitemativas de la mujer en America Latina" in No. 20 is similar in content 
HQ/1460.5/C643/LAC • Benson Collection stacks 



PERIODICALS 

Although nrrast Latin American feminist periodicals deal with problems and issues in the country of origin, 
a few view the Latina as a united, cohesive entity in Latin American society, and therefore have broader 
coverage.

COUNTRY-SPECIFIC PERIODICALS 

The intended audience and purpose of Latin Ame ican feminist periodicals varies from region to region. 
Countries with a larger percentage of educated middie-class women, such as Mexico, Argentina, 
Uruguay, and Brazil, tend to issue publications of a more scholariy nature. The lesser-developed areas, 
particuiariy the Andean region, issue publications of a didactic nature, with the intent of reaching a less 
sophisticated audience. Geographically isolated countries whose populace is fairiy well educated, such 
as many countries in the Caribbean, tend to issue newsletters disseminating infonration on activities of 
particular groups.

APPROACHES TO CONTEMPORARY MAYAN CULTURES: PERSONAL HISTORIES, 

DREAMS, FOLKTALES 

Compiled by David Pardue 

The Mayan Indians occupy a nearly contiguous territory in southern Mexico, Guateniala, and Belize; in size they 
rank next to the Quechua-speaking populatfon of Andean South America. There is an enormous amount of 
ethnographk: literature on them, and it continues to grow at an accelerating rate. The titles listed here are 
intended to complement the many academk: studies devoted to the present-day Maya. Such sources as life 
histories, dream analyses, and folktales are included-all of whk:h can illustrate aspects of a culture not usually 
discussed in tradittonal anthropological works. As far as possible, these texts allow the Mayas to speak for 
themselves, so that we may better understand their society. The following items show that certain areas and 
peoples tend to be favored by researchers, and are continually restudied. The Tzotzil in southem Mexico are an 
example: They have been extensively documented since the advent of the Harvard Chiapas Project in 1957. 
However, such studies have wider applfcation, as such a high degree of honrK>geneity exists in the Mesoamerican 
area that, although IndivkJual cultures may differ in detail, the overall pattems are similar.

LA CHICANA: WORK, FAMILY, EDUCATION, AND GENDER, 1979-1989 



Compiled by Margo Gutierrez 



Works listed below deal with the Chicana in contemporary society and are generally limited to 
those in the social and behavioral sciences, although a few citations representing personal reflections 
on gender and feminism are included. With a few exceptions, works cited in this brief bibliography are 
limited to Mexican American women; publications on Puerto Ricans. Cubans and other Latinas are not 
included. Investigators conducting in-depth research on the Chicana should consult general 
bibliographies both on Chicano and women's studies, as well as periodical indexes and abstracting 
services such as the Chicano Index, Social Sciences Index, Women's Studies Abstracts, and 
Sociological Abstracts. 



Anzaldiia, Gloria. Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza. San Francisco: Spinsters/Aunt 
Lute, 1387. 

The first half of this work is a highly personalized interpretation of factors shaping the new 
mestiza by a border-bred Chicana. A strong element of spirituality and sexual politics is 
evident.

LATIN AMERICAN POPU ATION CENSUSES 

Compiled by Sue Fuller 



Census publications from Latin American countries are often difficult to locate, to acquire, and to 
use. The year chosen for a census varies widely from country to country, and there is often a time 
lag of several years between the time that a census is taken and the time that the de\a is published. 
The following list reflects the Benson Latin American Collection holdings of the most recent national 
population census materials available in this library as of October 1989. New titles and additional 
volumes arrive on a continuing basis, so the online catalog should be consulted under the name of the 
country, followed by the word "census", subdivided by the year in which the census was taken, i.e., 
MEXICO-CENSUS, 1980.

MESOAMERICAN CODICES 
ConpBed by Mchael 0. Hbonymous 

The pictorial and writing traditions of Mesoamerica developed eariy in the cultural history of the area and flourished during the Classic 
and Post-aassic periods. While many of the native documents were destroyed in the course of the Conquest, the indigenous traditions 
did survive and were utilized in colonial New Spain. This l)ibliography contains selected references to the put)lished reproductions of 
sixty-one native screenfold books and tiras which have come to be known as codices. Other pictorial works, such as lienzos, genealogies, 
cadastral records, maps, and the Techialoyan-style documents, are not included here, "me codices are listed alphabetically with a brief 
descnption. The source of a published version of each codex and its call number follows. Consult the card catalog, the online catalog or 
one of the bibliographies listed below to tocate other editions of a codex or an interpretation and analysis of its content

Undocumented and Immigrant Children In the United States and Their Right to Education: Selected Sources 

Compiled by Danelle Crowley 

•Undocumented children" refsrs to minors not bom in the United States who lack proper documentation for residency. Their right to an 
education in the public school district where they lived was relatively unchallenged until the Texas legislature passed a law in 1975 which 
allowed free public education only to citizens and legally admitted alien children. A legal challenge to this law eventually amved at the U S 
Supreme Court and a decision was handed down in 1982. Sources listed here in chronolc^ical order of publication document some of the 
issues and legal decisions surrounding this controversy and discuss the cun'ent status, problems, and perceptions of undocumented and 
other immigrant students, their families, and educators.

Benson Latin American Collection 



NO. 64, March 1992 Editor: Ann Hartness 



PUWrS OF THE NEW WORLD 
OornpBed by RusseB E Thomas 



This bibliography focuses on the history of plant science in South America through the early nineteenth century. The Benson Collection's 
holdings in this area are significant and include rare books, facsimile editions, and large, elaborately produced reports of botanical 
expeditions. Much of the material listed is kept in the Rare Books and Manuscripts division of the library. 

The history of plant science in Latin America can be divided into three large areas: 1) TTie indigeous traditions, some of which are 
partially preserved in pre-Conquest picture writing and other artifacts, as well as in early post-Conquest histories and ethnographies; 2) 
16th and 17th century attempts by Europeans to discover materia /ned/ca-medically useful plants or drugs-in the Western hemisphere; 
and 3) the age of the Enlightenment and of modem botanical science and expeditions. All materials listed are in the Benson Latin 
American Collection. 

Subject headings for searching in the online catalog (UTCAT) in this area include BOTANY-, NATURAL HISTORY-, and MATERIA 
MEDICA-, foltowed by geographical qualifiers, such as BOTANY-PERU.
