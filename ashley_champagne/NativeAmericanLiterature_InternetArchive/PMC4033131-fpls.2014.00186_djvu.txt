Silicon (Si) plays a critical role in plant functional ecology, protecting plants from multiple 
environmental stressors. While all terrestrial plants contain some Si, wetland grasses are 
frequently found to have the highest concentrations, although the mechanisms driving Si 
accumulation in wetland grasses remain in large part uncertain. For example, active Si 
accumulation is often assumed to be responsible for elevated Si concentrations found in 
wetland grasses. However, life stage and differences in Si availability in the surrounding 
environment also appear to be important variables controlling the Si concentrations of 
wetland grasses. Here we used original data from five North American salt marshes, 
as well as all known published literature values, to examine the primary drivers of 
Si accumulation in Spartina, a genus of prolific salt marsh grasses found worldwide. 
We found evidence of multiple modes of Si accumulation in Spartina, with passive 
accumulation observed in non-degraded marshes where Spartina was native, while 
rejective accumulation was found in regions where Spartina was invasive. Evidence of 
active accumulation was found in only one marsh where Spartina was native, but was 
also subjected to nutrient over-enrichment. We developed a conceptual model which 
hypothesizes that the mode of Si uptake by Spartina is dependent on local environmental 
factors and genetic origin, supporting the idea that plant species should be placed 
along a spectrum of Si accumulation. We hypothesize that Spartina exhibits previously 
unrecognized phenotypic plasticity with regard to Si accumulation, allowing these plants 
to respond to changes in marsh condition. These results provide new insight regarding 
how salt marsh ecosystems regulate Si exchange at the land-sea interface.

INTRODUCTION 

The role of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in plant productiv- 
ity is well recognized by plant ecologists. Less well constrained is 
the importance of silicon (Si) in plant growth, maintenance, and 
fitness (Cooke and Leishman, 2011). In terrestrial ecosystems, Si 
is classified as a "quasi-essential" nutrient (Epstein, 2009) because 
it protects plants from a variety of stressors, including desiccation, 
heavy metal toxicity, and predation (Epstein, 1994; Hodson and 
Evans, 1995; Liang et al., 2007). Through their roots, plants take 
up dissolved silica (DSi) (SiOa) from the porewater, or soil solu- 
tion, and transport it through the transpiration stream via the 
xylem. As water leaves the plant, Si becomes concentrated at tran- 
spiration termini and is deposited as biogenic Si (BSi). As such, 
plants often demonstrate increasing BSi concentrations with age 
or growth (Jones and Handreck, 1967; Epstein, 1994), due to 
continual precipitation of BSi at transpiration termini and the 
inability of plants to translocate Si once precipitated (Raven, 1983; 
Epstein, 1994). Although the majority of Si in plants is located at 
transpiration termini (e.g., leaves), Si is also found throughout 
other portions of plants, such as the roots, rhizomes, and stems 
(Struyf et al., 2005b; Querne et al., 2012; Carey and Fulweiler, 
2013). The concentration of Si in plants is often higher than many 
macronutrients such as N and potassium (K). Si concentrations 



typically range from 0.1 to 10% by weight (by wt.) (Ma et al., 
2001), the largest range of any element found in plants (Epstein, 
1994). 

The accumulation of Si in plants occurs via three possible 
modes of uptake: (1) active accumulation, where plants take up 
more Si than they would through water uptake alone, (2) pas- 
sive accumulation, where plants have similar Si and water uptake 
rates, and (3) rejective or excluder accumulation, where Si uptake 
is slower than water uptake (Raven, 1983; Takahashi et al, 1990; 
Ma et al., 2001). These three possible modes of Si accumulation 
can be determined in several ways (Jones and Handreck, 1967; 
Takahashi et al, 1990; Ma et al, 2001). First, Si accumulation 
can be defined by the concentrations of Si in the aboveground 
plant tissue alone, where active accumulators typically have a dry 
weight of SiC>2 >1% by wt., passive accumulators between 0.5 
and 1% by wt., and excluders <0.5% by wt. (Ma et al., 2001; 
Street-Perrott and Barker, 2008; Hou et al., 2010; Carey and 
Fulweiler, 2012). The ratio of Si to calcium (Ca) is another means 
of determining the mode of Si accumulation, with Si:Ca ratios > 1 
indicating active accumulation, 0.5-1.0 indicating passive accu- 
mulation, and <0.5 indicating Si exclusion (Takahashi et al., 1990; 
Ma et al, 2001; Ma and Takahashi, 2002). Finally, the mode of 
Si accumulation can be determined based on the relationship

Silica uptake by Spartina 



between DSi porewater concentrations and aboveground biomass 
BSi concentrations (Jones and Handreck, 1967; De Bakker et al., 
1999; Norris and Hackney, 1999; Ma et al., 2001). In this case, a 
positive relationship between porewater DSi concentrations and 
above ground BSi concentrations indicates passive accumula- 
tion, a negative relationship indicates active accumulation, and 
no relationship indicates rejective accumulation (Raven, 1983; De 
Bakker etal, 1999). 

While all vegetation contains some Si (Epstein, 1994), grasses 
(Poaceae) and sedges (Cyperaceae) typically accumulate the most 
(Jones and Handreck, 1967; Raven, 1983; Ma and Takahashi, 
2002), which has been attributed to active Si accumulation by 
these plants (Jones and Handreck, 1967; Raven, 1983). However, 
it remains uncertain whether all wetland grasses fall into this cat- 
egory of active accumulation. For example, evidence exists that 
Spartina grasses, which are one of the most prolific genus of salt 
marsh grasses worldwide, are passive accumulators (Hou et al., 
2010; Querne et al., 2012) and possibly even rejector plants (De 
Bakker etal, 1999). 

Understanding the mechanism responsible for Si accumula- 
tion by salt marsh plants is important for understanding the 
controls on Si exchange at the land-sea interface. Tidal marshes, 
are large reservoirs of Si (Struyf et al., 2005b; Carey and Fulweiler, 
2013), and have been shown to play a critical role in regulating 
Si availability in adjacent estuarine waters (Struyf et al., 2005a; 
Jacobs et al., 2008; Vieillard et al., 2011). This has important 
consequences for marine trophic structure (Officer and Ryther, 
1980), as diatoms, a dominant type of phytoplankton in tem- 
perate coastal waters, require as much Si as N on a molar basis 
to survive (Redfield et al, 1963). Because the Si found in marsh 
plants (i.e., BSi) dissolves several orders of magnitude faster than 
mineral silicates (Alexandre et al., 1997; Cornelis et al., 2010a), 
understanding how marsh grasses sequester Si is a key step for 
understanding how salt marshes regulate Si exchange in these 
dynamic ecotones. 

Currently, controls on Si accumulation in salt marsh grasses 
are not well understood. For example, in addition to uncertain- 
ties regarding the mode of Si accumulation (i.e., active, pas- 
sive, or rejective accumulation), the role of plant age or growth 
rate in controlling Si accumulation remains unclear (Querne 
et al., 2012). Although increasing BSi content with growth has 
been observed for Spartina (De Bakker et al., 1999; Norris and 
Hackney, 1999; Querne et al., 2012; Carey and Fulweiler, 2013) 
and several species of freshwater marsh plants (Struyf et al., 
2005b), Hou et al. (2010) found no increase in S. alterniflora 
BSi concentrations over the growing season. The highly dynamic 
nature of salt marshes, which experience a wide range in nutri- 
ent availability, sediment type, and hydrologic conditions, could 
be responsible for the non-uniform BSi concentrations found in 
salt marsh plants. Furthermore, the amount of Si in the surround- 
ing environment may also exert an important control over plant 
Si accumulation, especially in cases of passive Si accumulation 
(Struyf et al., 2005b). In these cases, increased Si availability in soil 
solution, or porewater, would result in higher Si accumulation in 
the plants. 

The primary objective of this study was to determine the 
drivers of BSi accumulation in Spartina, one of the most common 



types of salt marsh grasses found worldwide. We hypothesize 
that differences in Spartina Si accumulation are driven by envi- 
ronmental conditions and plant origin (native vs. non-native). 
To test this hypothesis, we used original data from five New 
England (USA) salt marshes, as well as published literature val- 
ues, to examine the mode of Si accumulation, and the role of plant 
growth and in situ Si availability (in sediment and porewater) in 
controlling BSi accumulation in Spartina. We then developed a 
conceptual model which suggests that differences in aboveground 
BSi concentrations are due not only to differences in Si availabil- 
ity in marshes, but also different modes of Si uptake, representing 
a previously unrecognized form of phenotypic plasticity in these 
plants. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

We collected samples for Si accumulation at the height of grow- 
ing season (spring) and during peak biomass (summer) in five 
marshes in New England, USA: a salt marsh in northern Maine 
(Site 1) and four Rhode Island (RI) salt marshes (Sites 2-5) 
(Figure 1, Table 1). All of the marshes displayed patterns of veg- 
etation that are typical in New England marshes (Bricker-Urso 
et al., 1989; Wigand and Roman, 2012), with areas of "low marsh" 
that are inundated with tides twice a day consisting entirely of 
Spartina alterniflora grasses, while the areas of "high marsh" are 
inundated less frequently and are dominated by S. patens vegeta- 
tion. Site 1 is a relatively undisturbed fringing salt marsh, located 
adjacent to Acadia National Park, draining an undeveloped water- 
shed. The RI marshes cover a range of anthropogenic nutrient 
loadings and salinities (Table 1 ). Three of these marshes (Site 2-4) 
span the length of Narragansett Bay, from high to low nutrient 
inputs (DSi, N, P) (Figure 1, Table 1). Site 2 is a back-barrier 
marsh located on the east side of the Providence River Estuary, 
Site 3 is back-barrier marsh located on Prudence Island within 
the Narragansett Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, and 
Site 4 is a fringing marsh located on the south side of Zeek's

Creek in Jamestown, RI (Table 1 ) . Site 5 is fringing marsh in Great 
Salt Pond located 2 1 km south of the coast of RI, on a relatively 
undisturbed island (Block Island) exposed to low-nutrient ocean 
water. 

We measured net Si accumulation in the aboveground vegeta- 
tion, sediment, and porewater from the S. alterniflora zone at all 
sites. At sites 1 and 3, we also collected samples for aboveground 
vegetation, sediment, and porewater from the S. patens zone of 
the marshes. Sediment cores from sites 2-5 were also sieved for 
roots and rhizomes in order to analyze BSi content in below- 
ground vegetation. In all cases, triplicate measurements of each 
of the parameters were sampled. Sampling was paired, so that in 
all cases where we sampled aboveground vegetation, samples for 
sediment, belowground vegetation, and porewater were also col- 
lected. Sediment cores and porewater were sampled from within 
the 0.25 m 2 plot where aboveground vegetation was collected. 
The same marshes were sampled during each season, but not 
the exact same 0.25 m 2 plot within each marsh, as our sampling 



was destructive (e.g., removal of grass and sediment from marsh). 
All samples from each individual marsh were collected on a sin- 
gle day. The triplicate values from each individual marsh were 
averaged for each season (spring and summer). These average val- 
ues for spring and summer were treated as distinct value for all 
analyses. 

We harvested above ground vegetation from three randomly 
chosen 0.25 m 2 plots per sampling event. Vegetation was washed 
thoroughly with deionized water and dried at 70° C for 48 h before 
it was ground using a Wiley Mill. We collected sediment cores 
using PVC corers (30 cm long, 5 cm diameter). We divided our 
cores into four sections — the top 1, 1-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm. 
In order to calculate bulk density (mass of material per unit 
volume), we dried each core section at 70° C until it reached a 
constant mass over two consecutive days of weighing. Next, the 
cores were wet-sieved (0.5 mm sieve) to isolate roots and rhi- 
zomes, which were subsequently washed, dried, weighed, and 
analyzed for BSi concentrations. We collected triplicate porewater

samples using porewater peepers, a passive sampling technique 
(Templer et al, 1998). We followed methods detailed in Carey and 
Fulweiler (2013), where 20-mL scintillation vials are pre-filled 
with deionized water and capped with a permeable membrane 
in order to allow the exchange of ions. Each polyvinyl chloride 
(PVC) peeper contained 10 vertically-stacked vials placed 3 cm 
apart. Peepers were deployed vertically in the sediment for 2-3 
weeks, after which time the water was filtered using a 60-mL 
polypropylene syringe through a 0.45 micron nitrocellulose fil- 
ter. The timing of peeper deployment always corresponded with 
collected of the other samples (e.g., sediment cores, aboveground 
vegetation). Porewater samples were stored in polyethylene bot- 
tles and kept in a cool dark place until they were analyzed for DSi. 
At sites 2-5, we also measured salinity and pH of all porewater 
samples. 

We quantified sediment amorphous Si (ASi) content [which 
includes both BSi and pedogenic Si (Cornells et al., 2010a)] 
and biomass BSi concentrations using the wet chemical alkaline 
extraction in 1% Na2C03 solution (Demaster, 1981). Biomass 
was digested for 4h. Sediment was digested for 5h, with sub- 
samples taken at hours 3 and 4 in order to calculate a mineral 
correction (Demaster, 1981; Conley and Schelske, 2001). We used 
a Seal AA3 flow injection analyzer and the molybdenum blue 
colorimetric method (Strickland and Parsons, 1968) to measure 
DSi concentrations. We routinely compared our standards to 
Hach external standards and they were always within 4% of the 
expected value. 

In addition to our collected data from the five marshes in 
New England, we gathered all known published studies report- 
ing aboveground plant tissue Spartina BSi concentrations and 
either productivity (biomass per unit area) and/or porewater DSi 
concentrations. In total, we located five studies that fit these 
characteristics (Table 2). The five studies presented data from 
salt marshes on three continents — Europe (i.e., the Netherlands, 
France), North America (i.e., New England and Southeast, USA), 
and Asia (i.e., China). We then identified general site charac- 
teristics of each site (e.g., bulk density and N availability) for 
comparison (Table 1). 

In order to test the hypothesis that primary productivity or in- 
situ Si availability was driving aboveground BSi concentrations 
in Spartina, we ran correlation analysis between BSi concen- 
trations in aboveground material and the following variables: 
primary productivity [a proxy for plant age for perennial grasses, 
which reach maximum productivity in August and senesces in 
the fall (Wigand et al., 2004)], ASi concentrations in the sedi- 
ment, and DSi concentrations in porewater. We also ran simple 
linear regression and used the least squares method to estimate 
model parameters, with Spartina BSi concentrations as the inde- 
pendent variable in all cases. In addition to examining all data 
together to see if broad trends in Spartina BSi behavior were 
apparent, we grouped our data by species and region to deter- 
mine any differences related to taxonomy or location. We used the 
slopes of the regressions between Spartina BSi concentrations and 
porewater DSi concentrations to identify the mode of Si accumu- 
lation in these plants, with strong positive slopes indicating pas- 
sive accumulation, negative slopes indicating active accumulation 
and flat slopes indicating rejective accumulation. Comparisons 



across sites were determined using a One-Way ANOVA and 
"multcompare" command in Matlab. All statistics were done 
using Matlab using a of 0.05 as the threshold for significance. 
All BSi concentrations reported as percent SiC>2 by dry weight 
(dry wt.). 

RESULTS 

Si CONTENT OF NEW ENGLAND S. ALTERNIFLORA 

A large range of aboveground BSi concentrations in S. alterniflora 
were found in the marshes, and concentrations typically increased 
throughout the growing season (Table 3). The minimum con- 
centration observed was 0.24% by wt. (Site 5 in spring) and the 
maximum concentration measured was 1.04% by wt. (Site 2 in 
summer). These values align well with values reported in a meta- 
analysis by Hodson et al. (2005) and show that compared to other 
plant species in the order Poales, Spartina has relatively low Si 
concentrations. 

Sediment ASi concentrations were almost always higher in the 
top 1 cm of the sediment compared to the depths of 1-30 cm 
(except Site 3 in spring) (Table SI). We found no significant dif- 
ferences in ASi concentrations seasonally or among sites, except 
for Site 5, which had ASi concentrations (0.35 ± 0.07%) an 
order of magnitude lower than all other sites in this study (Avg. 
2.28 ±0.47% by wt.) (Table 3, Table SI). Similar to the sedi- 
ment ASi, the top one cm of the roots always had higher BSi 
content than the deeper depths (Table S2). Across all sites and 
both seasons, root BSi values ranged from a minimum of 0.18% 
observed at Site 5 in the summer to maximum value of 4.83% 
observed at Site 4 in summer. The average root BSi concentra- 
tion across all sites and seasons was 1.03 ±0.31%. Consistent 
with earlier observations in the same region (Carey and Fulweiler, 
2013), the rhizomes always had significantly less BSi than the 
roots (Avg. 0.26 ± 0.03% by wt.) (Table S2). We found no sea- 
sonal or site related patterns to BSi concentrations in roots and 
rhizomes (Table S2). 

Porewater DSi concentrations were higher during the summer 
compared to the spring and porewater values from Site 1 were 
typically higher than from the other marshes (Table 4, Table S3). 
Porewater concentrations ranged from 0 u,M (top 1 cm at Site 2 
in spring) to 384 (jlM (depth of 27 cm depth at Site 1 in sum- 
mer) (Table S3). Across marshes, porewater pH was significantly 
(p < 0.01) different during both spring and summer seasons. 
For example, during the summer the pH at Sites 4 and 5 was 
significantly (p < 0.01) lower compared to Site 2. 

Si CONTENT OF NEW ENGLAND S. PATENS 

At two of the marshes in this study (Sites 1 and 3) we ana- 
lyzed samples for Si accumulation in S. patens, or the high 
marsh platform zone of the marsh. Overall, Site 1 had higher Si 
accumulation than Site 3. For example, aboveground BSi con- 
centrations of S. patens were roughly three times higher at Site 
1 (Table 3), ranging from 0.58 to 1.25% by wt. (Site 2) and 
0.21 to 0.43% (Site 3). Likewise, sediment ASi concentrations 
were also higher at Site 1 (Avg 2.16 ±0.35% by wt.) than at 
Site 3 (Avg 1.31 ±0.27% by wt.) (Table 3, Table SI). Similar 
to S. alterniflora, the ASi concentrations in the top one cm of 
sediment were always higher than the deeper layers of the core

(except for summer Site 1 sample where 10-20 cm depth had 
slightly higher concentration) (Table SI). BSi in the roots and 
rhizomes in S. patens ranged from 0.08 to 0.96% and similar 
to S. alterniflora, BSi concentrations of the rhizomes (0.13 ± 
0.02%) were much lower than in the roots (0.36 ± 0.04%) 
(Table SI). 

Similar to other portions of the marsh budget, porewater con- 
centrations were an order of magnitude higher at Site 1 than 
at Site 3 on all occasions (Table 4, Table S3). Average porewater 



salinity (30.2 ppt) and pH (7.21) at Site 3 under S. patens veg- 
etation was similar to the values measured under S. alterniflora 
(Table 4). 

BSi ACCUMULATION AS A FUNCTION OF PRODUCTIVITY 

Using all available data from our analysis and the literature, we 
found a no correlation between aboveground productivity (mass 
per unit area) and BSi concentrations (n = 31, R = 0.22, p = 
0.23) (Figure 2). We next subdivided the entire data by species

(R 2 = 0.49) (solid trendline). In total these values represent nine marshes: 
three non-New England marshes (China, France, North Carolina, USA) and six 
New England marshes. New England data represent average values of 
triplicate field measurements, with separate points for spring and summer 
seasons. Individual points representing non-New England marshes either 
represent distinct seasons (Norris and Hackney, 1999; Hou et al., 2010) or 
marshes (Querne et al., 2012). 



and by location in order to determine if regional or taxonomic 
differences resulted in distinct relationships between productivity 
and BSi accumulation in these plants. However, this continued 
to result in no significant relationships between productivity and 
BSi concentrations in most situations: S. patens (n = 9, R = 
0.14, p = 0.72) and the non-New England S. alterniflora (n = 8, 
R = 0.46, P = 0.25). In fact, we only found the expected posi- 
tive relationship between productivity and BSi concentration in 
New England S. alterniflora (n = 14, R = 0.70, p <0.01) (this 
study, Carey and Fulweiler, 2013) (Figure 2). Although the ways 
in which BSi concentrations vary as a function of productivity 
is not uniform across sites, we found that all marshes, regard- 
less of location, begin the growing season with a fairly consistent 
amount of BSi in S. alterniflora tissue (0.38 to 0.45% by wt.) (y- 
intercept, Figure 2). However, after the initial growing period, BSi 
accumulation diverges. 

BSi ACCUMULATION AS A FUNCTION OF IN SITU Si AVAILABILITY 

In order to test our hypothesis that in situ Si availability impacts 
BSi accumulation in aboveground plant tissue, we wanted to 
determine whether elevated sediment ASi concentrations or DSi 
in the porewater was associated with higher concentrations of 
aboveground BSi concentrations. Sediment ASi data was only 
available in conjunction with aboveground BSi concentrations 
for our original data, and for Carey and Fulweiler (2013). We 
found a strong correlation (n = 22, R = 0.60, p < 0.01) between 
sediment availability and BSi content (Table 3). 

We found several studies, in addition to our own origi- 
nal data presented here, where porewater DSi concentrations 
are presented in conjunction with aboveground BSi concen- 
trations (Table 2). Similar to the relationship between above- 
ground BSi content and productivity, examining all the data 
together resulted in no relationship between the concentrations 



of BSi in aboveground biomass and the concentration of DSi 
in the porewater (« = 43, R = -0.20, p = 0.21). We then 
subdivided the data by region and/or species in order to 
determine if there were differences based on taxonomy or 
origin. In doing so, different and yet, distinct relationships 
between porewater DSi and biomass BSi concentrations became 
apparent. 

North American marshes 

A positive correlation between Spartina BSi concentrations 
and porewater DSi concentrations [n = 20, R = 0.77, p < 0.01) 
(Figure 3A) was observed when all the data from New England 
was grouped together [excluding the data from the degraded 
"high-N" marsh described by Carey and Fulweiler (2013), which 
is discussed below]. In examining this regional grouping by 
species, we found a similar positive relationship for both S. patens 
(n = 8,R = 0.93, p < 0.01) and S. alterniflora (n = 12, R = 0.72, 
p < 0.01). However, data from one New England marsh [S. 
alterniflora at the N-enriched marsh ("high-N" site) presented 
by Carey and Fulweiler, 2013] showed a distinctly different pat- 
tern, as we observed a negative relationship (n = 3, R = —0.98, 
p = 0.14) between porewater DSi concentrations and BSi concen- 
trations (Figure 3C). 

Besides the data from the New England salt marshes, Norris, 
and Hackney completed a study of net Si accumulation in a mid- 
Atlantic marsh (North Carolina, USA). This study also observed 
a negative relationship between porewater DSi concentrations 
and S. alterniflora BSi concentrations (n = 3, R = —0.94, p = 
0.22). However, unlike the pattern observed in the high-N marsh 
described by Carey and Fulweiler (2013), the data from this North 
Carolina marsh showed the opposite relationship with time, 
as over the course of growing season plant BSi concentrations 
decreased, while porewater concentrations increased (Figure SI).

European marshes 

We observed a weak relationship between plant BSi and porewater 
DSi concentrations (« = 18, R = -0.45, p = 0.07) in the data 
from the European marshes (De Bakker et al, 1999; Querne et al., 
2012). This weak negative relationship was primarily driven by 
two data points of low DSi porewater concentration (Figure 3B). 
Removing these two points (both of which are S. anglica) resulted 
in no relationship between those two variables (n = 16, R = 0.07, 
p = 0.80). 

DISCUSSION 

It is not uncommon for a single species of plant to contain dif- 
ferent amounts of Si (Hodson et al., 2005), but such variability is 
typically thought to be due to differences in Si availability in the 
surrounding environment or growth rates (Norris and Hackney, 
1999; Struyf et al, 2005b; Guntzer et al, 2012; Querne et al, 2012; 
Carey and Fulweiler, 2013). With regard to Spartina, productiv- 
ity does not appear to be a major control over Si accumulation. 
Despite commencing the growing season with a relatively uni- 
form amount of BSi, the relationship between productivity and 
aboveground BSi accumulation diverges at higher levels of pro- 
ductivity (Figure 1). This divergence indicates that productivity 
does not control BSi accumulation in the same manner in all 
Spartina species. 

Differences in transpiration rates have been shown to be 
responsible for different levels of Si accumulation in plant leaves 
(Cornelis et al., 2010b; Guntzer et al., 2012). As such, the lack 
of relationship between productivity and BSi concentrations may 
be due to variable transpiration rates among salt marhes and/or 
water availability across these marshes, supporting the idea that 
productivity is not a good proxy for water use (Hessini et al., 
2009). In addition to potential differences in water availability 
across sites, our results indicate that variable amounts of bio- 
available Si present in the system and different modes of Si 
accumulation by the plants are the likely drivers of this pattern. 



PASSIVE Si ACCUMULATION IN NEW ENGLAND MARSHES 

In the New England marshes, higher ASi availability in the sed- 
iments is associated with higher BSi accumulation in the plants. 
This correlation is likely due to the soluble nature of ASi, which 
is considered a biologically available form of Si, having disso- 
lution rates orders of magnitudes faster than mineral silicates 
(Struyf and Conley, 2012). New England salt marshes have some 
of the highest recorded sediment ASi concentrations (Carey and 
Fulweiler, 2013), which may explain why the BSi concentrations 
observed at several of these sites is higher than those found 
elsewhere (Figure 1). 

Similar to the relationship observed with sediment ASi, higher 
porewater DSi concentrations are associated with higher above- 
ground BSi concentrations in all New England data, except in 
a highly degraded marsh (high-N marsh, Carey and Fulweiler, 
2013) (discussed below) (Figure 3A). The positive relation- 
ship indicates that in the non-degraded New England marshes, 
Spartina passively accumulates Si, as more Si in the surround- 
ing environment is associated with more Si in aboveground plant 
tissue. Thus, in this situation of passive accumulation, in situ Si 
availability in both the sediment and porewater are important 
controls Si accumulation in Spartina. 

REJECTIVE Si ACCUMULATION IN EUROPEAN MARSHES 

Unlike the strong positive and negative relationships we observed 
between plant BSi concentrations and porewater DSi concen- 
trations in the New England marsh, we found no relationship 
between these two variables in the European marshes (Figure 3B). 
The lack of relationship between porewater DSi and plant BSi 
concentrations points toward Spartina in these systems behav- 
ing as a Si excluder, particularly at higher Si concentrations. In 
fact, De Bakker et al. (1999) also came to the same conclusion 
about their data, and suggested that S. anglica may reject Si from 
its tissue via a barrier on the outer surface of the roots, similar to 
legumes (Raven, 1983).

Carey and Fulweiler 



Silica uptake by Spartina 



The extensive reviews by Jones and Handreck (1967) and 
Raven (1983) point toward rejector plants accumulating 5-60% 
of the DSi that is in the transpired water, with the remain- 
der being left in the porewater. Further, at higher soil solution 
concentrations, plants will reject a larger portion of DSi (Raven, 
1983; Cornelis et al., 2010b), which we also find evidence for 
with our flat regression line between aboveground BSi content 
and porewater DSi concentrations (Figure 3B). The exact mech- 
anisms driving Si rejection in plants are not yet well understood, 
but it has been suggested that low Si accumulating plants have 
either a defective or non-existent Si transporter from cortical cells 
into the xylem (Ma and Yamaji, 2008). 

Our designation of a Si excluder to S. alterniflora in the French 
salt marsh disagrees from the original interpretation of the data 
(Querne et al., 2012). While Querne et al. (2012) do point out the 
lack of relationship between DSi porewater and plant BSi con- 
centrations, they assign S. alterniflora to the passive accumulator 
category based on the dry weight of BSi in the aboveground tis- 
sue alone. While this is a common practice when porewater DSi 
data is unavailable (Hou et al, 2010; Carey and Fulweiler, 2012), it 
ignores differences in transpiration or in situ Si availability. Thus, 
only defining Si accumulation by aboveground BSi concentration 
data may be misleading when passive Si accumulators are exposed 
to unusually high or low porewater concentrations, as one could 
incorrectly assign passive accumulators active or rejective status 
based on dry weight alone (Liang et al., 2005). Based on our 
analysis of the invasive Spartina from Europe, and the range of 
porewater concentrations observed in salt marshes, we are now 
skeptical at using the dry weight of BSi alone in quantifying mode 
of Si accumulation in marsh grasses. 

ACTIVE Si ACCUMULATION IN DEGRADED MARSH 

Unlike all other data from New England, we observed a negative 
relationship between porewater DSi availability and aboveground 
BSi content in the highly degraded salt marsh described in Carey 
and Fulweiler (2013) (Figure 3C). This negative relationship pro- 
vides evidence of active Si accumulation, with the plants seques- 
tering Si in high enough proportions to drive down porewater 
concentrations (Raven, 1983). As described by Raven (1983) and 
Jones and Handreck (1967), active Si accumulation results in 
the decline of DSi concentrations in the "bathing medium" as 
the plant takes up DSi relatively faster than it takes up water. 
Agricultural studies of active transport in rice, a known active Si 
accumulator, has identified two ATP-fuelled Si transporters (Ma 
and Yamaji, 2008), which transports Si through the membranes. 
Moreover, we consistently observed aboveground BSi concentra- 
tions >1% by wt., the threshold concentration shown to indicate 
active accumulation (Ma et al., 2001; Street-Perrott and Barker, 
2008; Carey and Fulweiler, 2012; Querne et al., 2012). 

In order to provide further support for our interpretation 
that the negative relationship between porewater DSi concen- 
trations and aboveground BSi concentrations indicates active Si 
accumulation, we looked to Struyf et al. (2005b), who exam- 
ined these two variables in a Western European tidal freshwater 
marsh dominated by Phragmites australis. P. australis is a known 
active Si accumulator, allowing us to examine the relationship 
between plant BSi and porewater DSi concentrations in a marsh 



experiencing active accumulation. Using the data presented by 
Struyf et al. (2005b), we found that P. australis also exhibits a 
strong negative relationship between porewater DSi concentra- 
tions and aboveground BSi concentrations (n = 5, R = —0.86, 
p = 0.06) (Figure 3C). The similar relationship between porewa- 
ter and aboveground BSi concentrations in P. australis and the 
S. alterniflora in the degraded high N marsh provides additional 
evidence of active Si accumulation in the degraded marsh. 

This site where evidence of active accumulation is observed 
is a high-nutrient, degraded salt marsh located downstream of 
an urban watershed (Wigand et al., 2003; Carey and Fulweiler, 
2013). In fact, the N loading here is so high that the marsh is 
now P-limited, with a summer average molar DIN/DIP ratio in 
the inundating tidal creek water of 53 (Table 1). While it is pos- 
sible that external factors are resulting in the declining porewater 
concentrations over time at this marsh, the fact that we do not 
observe this trend in the four nearby marshes indicates that the 
degraded, high N nature of the marsh is playing a role in the 
distinct behavior observed in Spartina here. 

The results of one study, which focused on Si accumulation 
in a North Carolina (USA) salt marsh (Norris and Hackney, 
1999), did not fit the criteria for any of the three modes of 
uptake. During our re-analysis of those data we observed a strong 
negative relationship between porewater DSi concentration and 
plant BSi concentration. While this trend initially indicates active 
accumulation, further examination of the change through time 
reveals that throughout the course of growing season, plant 
BSi concentrations decreased, while porewater concentrations 
increased (Figure SI). This is the opposite temporal relation- 
ship that one would find with active accumulation and does 
not fit the expected trend for passive or rejective accumulation 
either which signals a departure from any of the three traditional 
modes of uptake. The observations from this marsh call into ques- 
tion whether or not some plants, under certain conditions, can 
translocate Si. 

ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS AND PHEN0TYPIC PLASTICITY AS DRIVERS 
OF Si ACCUMULATION? 

In examining the site characteristics of these marshes, we identify 
several variables that may drive the different modes of Si accu- 
mulation within marsh plants. The marshes studied here span 
a range of conditions, from nutrient over-enriched to relatively 
undisturbed, exposing these grasses to variable amounts of stress. 
Studies of abiotic stress on plant BSi concentrations report mixed 
results. Querne et al. (2012) found no plant response upon expo- 
sure to several types of stress, while Schoelynck et al. (2012) found 
increased Si accumulation in macrophytes exposed to intense 
water currents. A recent study of a degraded, "high-N" marsh 
found significantly more Si accumulation in several components 
of the marsh budget compared to a lower nutrient marsh (Carey 
and Fulweiler, 2013), which was hypothesized to be due in part to 
the stress induced by high air temperatures and low amounts of 
rainfall. We now propose that this degraded salt marsh is actively 
accumulating Si, which we suggest is a defense mechanism to 
ameliorate environmental stress. 

In addition to marsh condition, genetic origin represents 
another variable across sites. S. alterniflora is native to the Atlantic

and Gulf of Mexico coasts of North America, but invasive in 
many areas of the world, including the Pacific coast of North 
America, Europe, and Asia. Similarly, S. anglica is invasive in 
Western Europe. Invasive species in general have been shown 
to exhibit higher phenotypic plasticity than non-invasive species 
(Davidson et al., 2011). Phenotypic plasticity refers to the abil- 
ity of organisms to change their observable traits in response 
to environmental conditions (Schlichting, 1986; Davidson et al., 
2011). This phenomenon maybe responsible for the different pat- 
terns in Si accumulation by salt marsh plants. Invasive species, 
particularly S. alterniflora, have been shown to exhibit higher 
phenotypic plasticity than the native plants (Zhao et al., 2010), 
which may explain the contrasting Si behavior by the same genus 
of plants. In particular, a recent study in China found the inva- 
sive S. alterniflora to show a higher degree of morphological 
growth, and biomass allocation plasticity in association with N 
availability compared to the native grass (Zhao et al., 2010). Our 
data suggests that genetic origin is another factor driving the 
differences in BSi accumulation in Spartina across sites. While 
phenotypic plasticity has been demonstrated for N, to our knowl- 
edge this is the first study to suggest a phenoplastic response of 
Spartina to Si. 

A CONCEPTUAL MODEL DESCRIBING DRIVERS OF Spartina Si UPTAKE 

Based upon the available data and our analysis above it is clear 
that wetland grasses cannot be grouped into one mode of Si 
accumulation. Rather we hypothesize that different Si accumu- 
lation modes are based on site-specific environmental conditions 
and genetic origin. To demonstrate this hypothesis we developed 
a conceptual model depicting the different modes of Si uptake 
by Spartina (Figure 4), which is based on the different slopes 
we observed in our linear regressions between porewater DSi 
availability and aboveground BSi concentrations (Figure 3). As 
illustrated in our model, we propose that Spartina passively accu- 
mulates Si in non-degraded marshes where the species are native, 
such as the case in the non-impaired New England marshes 
included in this study (Figures 3A, 4A). Further, we suggest that 



Spartina behaves as Si excluders/rejectors in situations where 
the plant is invasive (Figures 3B, 4B). Finally, we hypothesize 
that active Si accumulation by the native Spartina occurs when 
the plants are exposed to highly stressful, degraded conditions 
(Figures 3C, 4C). 

We present our conceptual model as a hypothesis which must 
be tested in future salt marsh research. Our hypothesis takes 
into account all known studies where Spartina BSi concentra- 
tions are reported alongside either porewater DSi concentrations 
or sediment ASi concentrations, but other confounding factors 
(e.g., diatom uptake, interaction with mineral silicates, and trans- 
port processes) also play a role in salt marsh Si dynamics. Thus, 
future work should focus on controlled field observations and 
laboratory studies which account for confounding variables as 
a means of testing the conceptual model that we put forth 
here. The recent recognition that gene expression can control Si 
accumulation in rice (Ma et al, 2006, 2007) highlights an excit- 
ing avenue of potential research for salt marsh grasses, such as 
Spartina. 

While this is the first study to provide evidence of variable 
modes of accumulation in Spartina, Liang et al. (2005, 2007) 
observed both active and passive Si accumulation within several 
of the same species of plants (e.g., cucumber, rice, maize, sun- 
flower, and wax gourd). Rather than the absolute categorization 
of "active" accumulator to grasses, the mode of Si accumulation 
within Spartina is variable depending on site-specific conditions. 
This interpretation aligns with the previous suggestion that plant 
species should be placed along a spectrum of accumulation, 
rather than categorized as having only one method of accumu- 
lation (Cooke and Leishman, 2011), an idea supported by recent 
work at the molecular-level of plant Si biochemistry (Ma et al., 
2006, 2007; Ma and Yamaji, 2008). 

ACTIVE Si ACCUMULATION AND A LOSS OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICE? 

Tidal wetlands are important regulators of Si fluxes to adjacent 
estuarine systems (Struyf et al, 2005a; Jacobs et al., 2008; Vieillard 
et al., 2011), often supplying DSi necessary for diatom growth in

coastal systems (Anderson et al., 2002; Danielsson et al, 2008). 
A recent mass balance of Si fluxes in a New England salt marsh 
found the marsh to be a "point" source of DSi to the adjacent 
estuary, primarily due to drainage of Si-rich porewater during the 
ebbing tide (Vieillard et al., 2011). We observed a 60% decline in 
marsh porewater concentration over the growing season (spring 
through fall) in the marsh experiencing active Si accumulation. 
In turn, we hypothesize that the presence of active Si accumula- 
tors in marshes may diminish the export of DSi to downstream 
coastal systems by reducing DSi porewater concentrations. While 
the BSi sequestered in the plants will eventually be remineral- 
ized, this may occur after the plant has been exported from the 
marsh. Even in the case that BSi is remineralized in situ, it will 
ultimately shift the timing of DSi availability in the system. A shift 
to active Si accumulation by marsh grasses exposed to degraded 
conditions may represent a previously unrecognized way that 
coastal nutrient enrichment can impact estuarine ecology in 
North America. 

Likewise P. australis is an invasive species throughout North 
American salt marshes (Chambers et al., 1999). We hypothesize 
that a shift in vegetation type from that of passively accumulat- 
ing Spartina to actively accumulating P. australis could result in 
lower marsh porewater DSi concentrations. Such lower porewa- 
ter DSi concentrations could reduce the ability for salt marshes to 
serve as sources of DSi to adjacent estuaries. In turn, we predict 
that invasion of P. australis to North American salt marshes may 
alter the timing and magnitude of Si exchange in coastal systems, 
highlighting a potentially unrealized consequence of this invasion 
to coastal ecosystems. 

Tidal wetlands have the ability to control Si availability in 
coastal systems, which has important consequences for phyto- 
plankton species composition. Here we present evidence that 
Spartina grasses may shift their mode of Si accumulation based on 
local environmental conditions and genetic origin. Recognition 
that these wetland grasses accumulate Si differently depending 
on site-specific characteristics provides new insight regarding the 
role these grasses play in Si dynamics at this borderland between 
land and sea.
