ABSTRACT 



This 8 -week interdisciplinary unit for fourth- and 
fifth-grade students helps children address the U.S. westward expansion in 
the 1840 *s using the interactive software program. The Oregon Trail. The unit 
provides connections to literature, geography, computer /mathematics skills, 
language arts, and research skills. The work is done in cooperative groups 
over the course of the unit with a variety of assessment strategies 
suggested. Worksheets, handouts, and student materials are included. Upon 
completion of the unit students will be able to: (1) locate and identify the 

states along the Oregon Trail; (2) identify reasons for westward expansion; 

(3) gain a basic understanding of some of the native North American culture; 

(4) participate in collaborative group activities; and (5) demonstrate 
knowledge of life in the 1840s- -food, clothing, families, etc. Selected 
bibliography contains 32 items. (EH)

America’s move to the Pacific. 

Geography ~ Learning about the states west of the 
Mississippi, Identifying locations along 
the Oregon Trail.

etc. I 

Language Arts Skills ~ Prepare a and present 
short book report it to the class. 

Library Skills - Developing research strategies 
and investigating numerous sources 
of information. 

Overview; Students will be studying the westward expansion of tlie United 
States over the next 8 weeks. Rather than concentrating on this 
portion of American History in isolation, the class will 
incorporate geography, literature, computer skills and oral skills 
into this unit. They will be making comparasions between their 
livea and the lives of the pioneers as they moved westward to 
settle. Through the literature they will learn about the hardships 
these people endured and the many problems and obstacles they 
overcame. 

Subject Objective; Upon completion this unit the students will be able 

to; 1) locate and identify the states along the Oregon Trail, 

2) identify reasons for the westward expansion 

3) gain a basic imderstanding of some of the native North 
American cultures 

4) participate in collaborative group activities. 

5) demonstrate knowledge of fife in the 1840’s - food, clothing, 
families, etc. 

Materials; Maps, computer and software, assorted fiction and non-fiction 
accounts of westward expansion and life along the Oregon TYail

Activities: After the first meeting in the libraiy, the class will be broken up 

into five cooperative work groups. Over the 8 weeks the class 
will be assigned several overlapping projects. As one group is 
working to "travel" the Oregon Ttail, two others will reading and 
preparing their book reports. The fourth group will be studying 
map skills. The fifth group will research different aspects of life in 
the 1840's and present their findings in the form of a poster. 

Assessment: Final assessment for this imit will be multifaceted. 

The students will write a letter home to a friend or family 
member telling about an adventure or experience they had along 
the Oregon Trail. Each group will also prepare a short report on 
trip along the Oregon Trail.their experiences and and success 
in reaching Oregon. 

E^valuation: These activities will be used to measure the students 

application and synthesis of the material/ information gained 
during the previous 7 weeks. Assessment will be both individual 
and collective. 

Follow up Activity: As a follow up activity, the class may e-mail to 

schools along the Oregon Trail seeking additional information.

will read BROTHER EAGLE. SISTER SKY to introduce the 
class to Native North Americans and Westward Expansion. The 
whole group will participate in building a semantic web about the 
Oregon Trail. The LMS will show books and resources available 
and students will begin to select books for their oral reports. 
Finally, small groups will be established 

(collaborativefy by the teacher and LMS) and groups will engage 
in problem solving activity as a group, solving a hidden word 
puzzle.

will complete the map and transcribe it onto poster board for 
display in the library. Then the students working individually or 
in teams wiU complete their own maps to be placed in their 
OREGON TRAIL FOLDERS. Finally the students will add 
information to the semantic web, which is also on display in the 
library. 

METHODS: 

In both the whole group and small group activities, the LMS 
will facilitate student learning. The LMS will demonstrate map 
skills to the whole group and discussion will be used for patterned 
learning.
