ABSTRACT 

, This document contrasts the concept of 

multiculturalinm as it appears in the proposed New York State 
curriculum guide, "A Curriculum of Inclusion," and as it appears in 
the California State history/social sciences curriculum. California 
uses the following approaches to reflect the multiracial, 
multicultural nature of American society: (1) expanding the study of 
world history to include the development of non-Western 
civilizations; (2) encouraging the use of the literature and art of 
diverse cultures; (3) recognizing the central role of Blacks in 
reshaping American political institutions; (4) recognizing the 
importance of ethnic groups in building the nation; (5) emphasizing 
civic values, democratic behaviors, and human rights; and (6) 
balancing the concept of pluralism with the sense of unity. However, 
the New York proposal disparages common elements in American society 
in the following ways: (1) overstating the inherent racism of the 
existing curriculum; (2) focusing only on African American, Asian 
American, Native American, and Latino/Puerto Rican perspectives; (3) 
treating Whites and Western culture with contempt; (4) asserting that 
curricular bias is responsible for the poor academic achievement of 
minority group students; (5) basing the need for revision on 
questionable demographic trends and political pressure; (6) endorsing 
the notion of collective, historical guilt; and (7) encouraging 
racial chauvinism and racial superiority. (FMW)

Multiculturalism in the Curriculum 
By Diane S. Ravitch 

In niid-Novembcr, the State Department of Education held a workins session to 
discuss the implementation of "A Curriculum of Inclusion." I spoke as one of four 
consultants. Six members of the Task Force were present, as were Commissioner Sobol 
and two members of the Board of Regents. I intend to tell you the same things that I told 



^ ^ , after Thomas Sobol was appointed Commissioner of Education, he appointed 
a Task Force on Minorities: Equity and Excellence. It was chaired by Hazel Dukes, chair of 
he New York State NAACP. The task force was composed of representatives of black 
Latino, Asian, ant' Amencan Indian minorities. 

Among other things, the task force was charged with reviewing the state 
cumculum. The task force--and its consultants-reviewed the teacher guides that the state 
prepares in every subject area. They did not review textbooks or other materials read bv 
students New York State does not adopt textbooks; teachers and districts are free to use 
any textbook they choose. In fact, the only way that the state knows whether the districts 
are paying any attention to its curriculum guides is by the results of the Rec^ents' 
Examinations, which students take at the end of high school. ^ 

p. A ^f"J"^^ ^^^^ "^^^^ ^^P^"^ °" ^^'^ ^^^^^ curriculum was submitted to the 

Board of Regents for discussion. It is now being reviewed by the Commissioner, who will 
make recommendations to the Board of Regents in January 1990. 

Ttie first sentence of the task force repon summarizes its major findinss It savs- 
Afncan Americans, Asian Americans, Puerto Ricans/Latinos. and Native An^ericans'have 
all been the victims of an intellectual and educational oppression tliat has characterized the 
culture and instimtions of the United States and the European American world for 
centunes. In the words of the Commissioner, the Task Force repon calls for "sweepin- 
changes in what and how we teach." It is not a curriculum; it is a proposal for a new " 
cumculum, new instructional strategies, a new administrative office in the State Education 
Department to enforce cultural equity," and changes in teacher education. 

While the task force calls for revision of all cunricular areas-mathematics, science 
uZ'^n. ^''■i'.'^f----^^°"g multicultiiral lines, I am going to look only at the .social studies 
because this tield was the man focus of the Task Force report. 

Today I will be comparing the concept of multiculturalism as it is presented in the

What is multiculturalism? It is a term that means that the schools must recognize ttiat 
this nation is a society of many different cultures, and that one of our strengths as a nation 
is our extraordinary diversity. As the world grows ever smaller and ever more 
interdependent, it becomes clear th America's experience in creating a multi-racial, multi- 
ethnic, multi-rehgious society is of international importance. Most wars in the history of the 
world have derived from the inability of people to tolerate others who are different: who 
have a different skin color, a different religion, a different language, or a different heritage. 

Tlius, our ability to forge a successful society, where opportunity is truly open to 
all, where respect is truly available to all, where diversity is enjoyed and admired, is 
. important both for ourselves and for the world. 

The curriculum in American schools must be revised to appropriately reflect the 
multi-racial, multicultural nature of American society, past and present. Dui'ing the past 
generation, textbooks have been revised to incorporate a broader perspective of the 
American past, but in all too many cases, the additions are merely add-ons, boxes on the 
side of the main story. The story itself must be told as the forging of a new people, who 
have learned and are learning to live amicably with others who are different. And that all of 
us, however we differ, are Americans. 

Revisions have been made, and they will continue to be made, because the nature of 
history is one of constant improvement in what we know about the past and how we 
characterize it. But revisions must be made without sacrificing historical accuracy. 

Let me set a context for discussing these issues. Tlie field of history-social studies 
is only now beginning to recognize its shortcomings. It should be clear from the dismal 
results of the National Assessment of Educational Progress survey of 1986 that American 
children, regardless of their race or ethnicity, have a very poor understanding of American 
history. Numerous research studies have shown that the most widely used textbooks are 
ineffective in large pan because they are overioaded with facts and pay little attention to the 
significance of those facts. Furthermore, certain states-and New York and California are 
among them--allow teachers to become credentialed as social studies teachers even though 
they have not studied a single course in history during their college years. This is a 
disgrace. To expect them to teach history in an even more nuanced and complicated fashion 
when they don't know any history themselves is an expectation that is foreordained for 
failure. 

It is within this context that a number of states have revised their offerings in the 
social studies to increase historical content and multicultural content. Both California and 
New York State revised their curriculum in 1987. 1 was the principal co-writer of the 
California curriculum and am well familiar with the process in that slate. 

The New York State curriculum revision involved dozens of teachers, super\'isors, 
and consultants from around the state. I was not one of them. I have been told that the state 
education department made a conscious effort to improve the multicultural quality of the 
curriculum. In addition, the final draft of the social suidies curriculum was reviewed bv 
John Kahionhes Fadden of the Six Nations Indian Museum; by Dr. Eric Foner of 
Columbia University; by the late Dr. Hazel Hertzberg of Teachers College; bv Dr. 
Christopher Lasch of the University of Rochester, and by Dr. Ronald LiTcchi'no of 
Svracuse University.

I am not here to defend the New York State social studies svllabi. Yet I must point 
out that these syllabi are in no way racist or biased. None of them contains a single 
statement that could be construed as offensive to any racial or ethnic group. 



The problem with Uiem, for me, is quite different. Reading the course syllabi for 
the social studies in grades 7, 8, and 1 1 persuades me that Americlin histor^ in fhe s l ool^ 
of New York State is presented as a boring parade of facts and trends. Wh?t is mLi nc?) 
There is very little reference to people. Instead, impersonal forces drive events trends''" 
come and go, changes occur. History happens, but individuals don't count- no'one seems 

merel^a fSmote' '"^^ ^^""^ '''' ^^-'-y- P-p" " 

V^^ problem of the social studies in this state goes far beycnd the issue of 
mu.ticulturalism As presently organized and presented in these syllabi, the social studies 
must be a ti^moff for many students, whatever their race or ethnicity. They pTe on lonl 
sts of disconnected facts, abstract concepts, and generic skills; they do not ^ ve the reader 
tlie feeling that anyone might enjoy this field. > ^ noi ^ive tne reaaer 

The global studies syllabi for grades 9 and 10 are not racist or culturally biased

society, and economics of the worid's majo? regions. Equal time^ I ven to AW 
America, and Western Europe, as well as four other m:^or world regions. The ciScu urn 
might well be faulted for minimizing the influence of Western Europe on the vorW dunn" 
the past 500 years. It certainly should be faulted for being overloaded with morXt and 
concepts than youngsters of this age can reasonably be expected to learn

I 



Now, to accomplish all of these things through the history/social studies curriculum 
is difficult. Here is how we tried to do it in California: 

First, world history was expanded to three required years, during which there is 
time to examine the civilizations that developed in Africa, the Near East, China, India, and 
elsewhere; the civilizations of the Mayas, Incas, and Aztecs, the growth of Western 
civilization in Europe; and the problems of the 20th centun, wor'.d. 

Second, teachers of world history and American history are encouraged to use 
literature and art of diverse cultures-myths, legends, i-eligious literature, poems, novels, 
biographies, and so on. 

Third, the curriculum recognizes explicitly the central role of blacks in reshapinsi 
American political institutions. Major units are devoted to slavery in American histor>'; to 
tlie abolition movement; to the post-Civil War amendments, and to the wav they were 
undemiined by racist political actions and replaced by Jim Crow laws, peonase and 
segregation; and to the civil rights movement of the 20th century. 

Fourth, wherever historically appropriate, the curriculum recognizes the imponance 
of ethnic groups in the building of the nation. A good deal of attention is paid to the 
Hispanic roots of tlie Southwest, as well as to Asian and Chicano immieration to 
California. And the internment of Japanese-Americans during Worid War II is confronted 
and honestly treated as a violation of basic human rights. 

_ Fifth, great emphasis is placed in every grade on teaching civic values, democratic 
behaviors, and human rights. Children are encouraged by word and deed to respect 
themselves and to respect others; to admire those cultures that respect human disinitv and to 
criticize those that do not. They leam to take a critical view of societies that enslave'people, 
that treat women as beasts of burden, that deny basic human rights like freedom of relitiion 
and freedom of press and speech. 

Sixth, and particulady imponant for this discussion, the curriculum framework has 
a strand called "National Identity." This is described as follows: 

"Students must: Recognize thai American society is now and alwavs has been 
pliirahsiic anci nuilticultural. From the first encounter between indiccnous peoples and 
exploring Europeans, the inhabitants of the North American continent have represented a 
vanety of races, religions, languages, and ethnic and cultural groups. With the passage of 
time, the United States has grown increasingly diverse in its social and cultural 
composition. Yet. even as our people have become increasingly diverse, there is broad 
recognition that we are one people. Whatever our origins, weVre all Americans." 

This strand concludes with. "Realize thai irue patriotism celebrates the moral force 
of the American idea as a nation that unites as one people the descendants of many adtiires 
races, religions, and ethnic groups." 

I offer the California approach to multiculturalisiTi as one -.vav to reconcile the 
conflicting commands of our national motto. "E Pluribus Unum."' Out of many, one. In the 
past, many people thought that the slogan meant that everyone must be thrown into ciie 



melting pot, boiled vigorously, and cooked into an assimilated new breed, devoid of any 
attachments to any group. 

We have long known that melting pot assimilation does not work. People do retain 
ethnic, racial, religious and cultural ties. They continue to have group memories and aroiip 
loyalties that persist from generation to generation. Here in New York Citv the home of 
ethnic neighborhoods ethnic foods, ethnic parades, and ethnic celebration,' we don't need 
to be reminded that ethnicity is an enduring and a valued part of American life. 

The problem, of course, is how to redefine "E Pluribus Unum" so that we can 
retain the values of pluralism and still remain one society, one people. 

_ Pluralism is a positive value, but it is also important that we presei-ve a sense of -in 
Amencan community-a society and a culture to which we all belons If there is no overill 
community, if all we have is a group of racial and ethnic cultures, then we have no means 
to mobilize public opinion on behalf of people who are not a member of their "roup We' 
have, for example, no reason to support public education. Public education is paid for bv 
tax dollars to educate all children for their own good and for the sood of the larger 
coriimunity^ If there is no larger community, then each group wifl want to teaclfits own 
children and public education ceases to exist. 

How does the task force repon, "A Curriculum of Inclusion" deal with this problem 
of balance between the competing claims of the one and the many? ^ 

I don't think that this proposal attempts to balance the one and the manv at all It is 
a bottom, a call not for inclusion but for a radicil rewriting of American biston' (and cvcia' 
other subject) which disparages any common elements in our history, society and culture.' 

First, it seems important to point out that the sweeping condemnntion of the so 'ial 
studies matenals by the Task Force is overstoted. In reviewing these cur.cuU ni^ue rhl I 
was time and again impressed-particularly in the social studies cumculr of the fxx\v " 
grades--with the veiy great and careful attention devoted to multicultura.ism The teacher 
guides for these grades repeatedly direct teachers to books and stories I'r.d audiovisual 
about Afncan Asian, Latino, Native American and other racial and ethnic croups I " 
assumed that the consultants directed so much crincism at the balv-count in^ the illustrations 
beaiuse the multicultunU content of the curriculum in these trades is actuall v quite sn^o 
And as I mennoned before, the global studies curricula is fair and comprehensive 

I agree with the consultants that visuals produced bv the State Education 
Depiu-tment should always pom-ay cultural diversity; the ex'amples that thev identified 

In Jnsidvi^v in l?nnl''"^' 'Y'^''-}'' ''"^^ only examp "of cultt.ral 

insensitivity in a 1 of these cumcular guides was identified bv the Lat no consultant the 
reference to the Mexican War of the 1840s ("sometimes one countrVs ^ood int n tin arc

denouncing the war has been called the most courageous speech ever delivered in the L.-S. 

.nH it. .^PtT' ^If^^^^f"^ Of "cultures" in the report is v'erv troublesome. The task force 
and u consultants tell us that they have chosen to view the curriculum throuah the eves of 
he following cultures: Alncan American, Asi:ui American. Native American: and " 
Latino/Pueno Rican. 



ERIC 



However, the consultants remind us that each of these labels in fact represents 
many cultures. There are 12 Native American tribes in New York State, we are told, and 
some 300 tribes in the United States; each has its own distinctive culture, and many have a 
distinctive language. The Latino/Puerto Rican label covers a large number of quite different 
cultures, including Mexican-Americans, Cuban-Americans, and a variety of other 
distinctive groups from Central and South America. The Asian American consultant points 
out that there are numerous distinctive Asian cultures among Asian-Americans, many with 
quite different languages and historical experiences. And, of course, African Americans 
include a disparate variety of groups with distinctive historical experiences. 

But the report chooses to treat each of these labels as though they truly represent a 
single group or culture, which they do not. 

In the same stereotypical way, the report describes "European Americans" in ways 
that are culturally inappropriate, indeed in ways that are offensive, insensitive and biased. 
All people wdth a white skin color are referred to as Europeans or "Anglo-Saxons." 
According to the report, Jews and Germans, Irish and Russians, French and Italians, 
Bulgarians and Spanish, are all members of the same group, all "Anglo-Saxons." 

The report treats issues of culture and ethnicity and religion treated in so superficial, 
so erroneous and so contemptuous a fashion that it damages the task force's credibility. 

If New York State intends to take ethnicity and culture seriously, then it must note 
that the Harvard Encyclopaedia of American Ethnic Groups includes more than 150 
separate entries, not including the 300 Native American tribes. A truly multicultural 
curriculum would take account of those 150 groups, a truly distinctive feature of American 
life and society, and not throw them into five separate but equal melting pots, as this repon 
does. This does not mean that each must be the subject of study, but that the truly diverse, 
multi-faceted nature of ethnicity in America must be recognized. 

Third, the tone of the report is both anti-v/hite and anti-western. It pleads for 
respect among all cultures, yet treats western culture with contempt, finding nothinsz in 
western history and white people but racism, greed, egoism, and intolerance. There are 
many terrible chapters in western histoiy-one thinks not only of slavery, but of the 
Holocaust, the Inquisition, and the Gulag, to name just a few-yet western Europe was also 
responsible for the rationalism and humanism of the EnHghtenment and the democratic 
political tradition. The very concept of ethnocentrism is the product of western 
anthropology. Whatever one's political ideology, it is difficult to disregard the influence of 
western thought. 

One cannot read Martin Luther King, Jr.'s writings without realizing how deeply he 
was influenced by western culture. He alludes repeatedly to such seminal thinkers as 
Buber, Tillich, Niebuhr, and Spinoza. He was influenced by Gandhi, who in turn was 
influenced by Henry David Thoreau and Leo Tolstoy. T'-. King was of African descent, 
but he was both a product of western civilization and a uynamic force in influencinsi 
American and western culture. ^ 

A new curriculum cannot be built around a proposal that demeans and caricatures 
the culture of which it is part, and that disparages everyone who happens to have a white 
skin. 

Efiurth, the Task Force report repeatedly asserts that the bias in these curricular 
materials is responsible for the poor performance of children from racial and ethnic 
minorities. No evidence is provided for this sweeping assenion. If this is true, why do

these benign and rather uninspiring-teacher guides instead of demanding that the Legislature

Fifth, the Task Force makes some rather strong predictions about demoeraphv that 
are either wrong or questionable. The report states that people of African, Asian, Latino 
and Native Amencan descent will "in the noi-so-distant future constitute a majority of New 
York s population, (p. 16) Since these groups are presently 20-25% of the state's 
population, this is a bold prediction indeed. 

omn • ^^""^^^^y- ^^4'^^^^ Force's demographic projection for the workforce in the year 
2000 IS inaccurate. The report-says on p. 2 that "non-whites will make up 29 percent of the

of the workforce. This statement leads one to believe that the proponion of minorities in

2000 the current non-white share of the workforce is 13.1%; in the year 2000, it will be 



All minority children should be educated, whether their group is 1 % or -^0% of the 
population. But the appeal should be based on what is right, on grounds of justice and 
equity, not an implicit threat that minorities are about to overwhelm the majority. 

Sixlh the report seems to endorse the dubious notion of collective guilt and 
historical guilt. In effect all white people today are responsible for slaver>'^and should feel 
a personal sense of guilt for what other white people did five hui:dred years ago, one

HI the 1 1 th grade syllabus, teachers learn that the two major influences on the L S 
Constitution were: 1) 17th and 18th centur%' Enliehtenment thought- and ^) the " " 
Haudenosaunee political system." The latter refers to the Longhoiise Ind'ians of New York 



State; one of the curriculum guides notes that the department staff met with a 
Haudenosaunee delegation of 12, including seven chiefs; apparently their presentation was 
compelling. Whether the influence of the Haudenosaunee on the drafters of the Constitution 
was decisive I cannot say; but I do believe that New York State is the only state that teaches 
that it was. 

There is a danger, and I have seen it in the curricula of Poland and China and the 
textbooks of the Soviet Union, and the danger is that of politicized history and Official 
History. Will truth depend on who is in power? Will our teaching of history be rewritten 
depending on who won the last election? Will curriculum writers rewrite history to assuage 
angry pressure groups? Although I participated in what seemed to me to be a successful " 
venture in drafting a state curriculum, I suspect that most such efforts are wide open for 
abuse, and it may be the exception not the rule when a state cuiriculum is able to avoid the 
danger of politicization by interest groups. 

What we should be teaching children in history is to examine a variety of 
interpretations and to learn to ask questions. As the power of the mass media grow ever 
stronger, we must teach children to resist any kind of official truths and to accept nothing in 
the textbooks on faith. Instead of Official History, our youngsters should learn how to test 
evidence and form their own opinion. 

Eighth, I want to discuss what the study of history might teach us about the nature 
of race and its importance as a category. 

The Task Force wants to use history and social studies to teach self-esteem to 
children of minorities. This is a complicated subject indeed. It is pertectiy appropriate to 
find in history many examples of achievement by people of all races and ethnic 
backgrounds. Doing so enables all children to see that one's skin color or ethnicity is no 
barrier to success. 

On the other hand, history should not be used to teach racial chauvinism or racial 
superiority. We want children to know that racism imd prejudice are evil. Eveiy race has 
been guilty of terrible crimes against humanity in histon,' (very often against members of 
their own race). 

Whites were guilty of permitting slavery; whites were responsible for the Holocaust 
and other horrible crimes. Other racial groups have committed comparable crimes. 
Remember that white slave traders bought African slaves from Arab sla /e traders. ^\ ho 
bought them from African tribes who enslaved their captives during wan:. Aztec peoples 
practiced human sacrifice and slavery. Before Worid War I, the Turkish government 
massacred hundreds of thousands of Armenians. In Africa i;. the late 1960s, a million or 
more Ibo people were stan'ed to death by the Nigerian government when thev tried to 
create a secessionist Biafran state. In China, the Muoist^government killed millions of 
Chinese people. Japan slaughtered tens of thousands of Chinese durin^z the infamous 
"Rape of Nanking" in the 1930s. The Klmier Rouge government slauizhtercd more than a 
million of its own people in the 1970s. 

No race has a corner on virtue. Each child should learn to value himself or herself 
as a member of the human race. Self-esteem ultimately must derive from one's own hard 
work and accomplishments, not from pride in one's skin color, which is an inherited 
attribute rather than Lin accomplishment.
