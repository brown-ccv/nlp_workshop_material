ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 



There were several people involved in the preparation of this document. Thanks to Ruth Bagworth for 
compiling the fifth edition of NATIVE PEOPLES as well as to Elaine Seepish and Diane Dwarka of 
the Instructional Resources Unit of Manitoba Education and Training, for overseeing the project. The 
cover motif consists of stylized syllabics meaning "books talking" and was designed by Garry Robson

CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING BIAS 



It is recognized that exposing students to a variety of controversial issues and opinions can be a valuable 
learning experience. Therefore, not all materials which contain negative biases have been eliminated 
from this bibliography. Teachers are urged, however, to preview all materials to determine their 
suitability. The following guidelines are designed to assist in identifying biases involving culture, 
religion, sex, age, and physical and mental capacities. For convenience and ease of reference, these 
guidelines have been divided into two broad sections which include several categories. 



I Historical Accuracy and Balance * 

Concreteness and Inclusiveness 

1 . (a) Texts should identify the source of information wherever statements purport to be 

factual, in order to minimize editorializing, generalization, vagueness and 
ambiguity. In the event that original source material is unavailable, students 
should be made aware that the view presented is an interpretation of the facts. 

(b) Where actual documents are available, reference should be made to them with 
special attention being given to presentation of different points of view, should 
these exist. 

2. Accounts of a particular event should clearly indicate that they reflect the perceptions, 
attitudes, language, concerns, setting, and times of the event. 

3. The subject matter should be dealt with in a balanced way in order to cover multiple 
aspects of the event or situation including the contributions of various people or groups 
and their popular or unpopular positions, different cultural approaches, controversial 
viewpoints, varying roles and occupations. 

4. Subject matter specifically dealing with vocational and occupational roles should provide 
information about as wide a spectrum of opportunities available in society as is possible, 
with specific care to avoid the presentation of sex-typed occupational categories. 



II Comprehensiveness and Unity 
Language and Realism 

5. In order to reduce the danger of attributing selected characteristics of an individual to the 
total group of which that person is a part, adjectives, or phrases descriptive of the human 
character should relate to an identifiable person rather than to an identifiable group of 
persons. 



’ Adapted from the Task Force Report on Textbook Evaluation, Manitoba Department of Education, 1973. 




- vi 



8 



6. Where a particular group of persons is described in an account, the information should 
be presented in a complete and meaningful way rather than in a fragmented or scattered 
fashion. 

7. Pictures and illustrations should be congruent with the coverage allocated to the persons 
or events discussed, supported by appropriate captions of the pictures’ locations, times 
and dates. 

8. Slanting by way of value laden words or labels should be avoided. 

9. Illustrations and written material must not perpetuate stereotypes about people based upon 
race, religion, creed, nationality, ancestry, ethnicity, sex, colour, age, or culture. 

10. Social evils, including prejudice and discrimination, should be examined rather than 
ignored. Current and past events should receive frank and realistic treatment. Matters 
of broad social concern, whether regarded as negative or positive, should not be omitted 
or ignored but should be identified and explored. 

1 1 . Illustrations in texts should reflect the wide variety of individual differences within all 
segments of our society. 

12. The language and terms used should accurately describe individuals, groups, and 
situations. They should not reinforce questionable attitudes or assumptions about people.

GLOSSARY OF TERMS* 


Bias: 


To slant in a particular direction in favour of or against an identifiable 
group of persons. 


Discrimination: 


Inferior treatment of a person or group of persons based upon prejudicial 
attitudes. 


Ethnic group: 


Those persons bound together by traditions of culture including at least 
some components such as customs, religion, language, nationality. 


Learning materials: 


Any material, printed, visual, auditory, which a teacher introduces into 
the classroom to provide a learning experience. 


Prejudice: 


1. An attitude toward other persons or groups of persons based upon 
preconceived or irrational opinions as opposed to reason or fact 
(believed to stem from fear, history, dislike, economic, or political 
needs). 

2. When prefaced by words such as sexual, racial, ethnic, religious, 
colour; tending to support a belief that one is inferior or superior 
to the other. 


Stereotyped: 


1 . Preconceived ideas or pictures of what all members in a particular 
group are assumed to be or to look like. 

2. The tendency to group together persons of the same race, religion, 
colour, or ethnicity, and generalize about them as "types" rather 
than think of them as individuals possessing distinctive 
characteristics.

CRITERIA FOR IDENTIFYING BIAS* 



When analyzing the content of instructional material, the following criteria may be employed to identify 

forms of bias: 

1 . Bias by omission: selecting information that reflects credit on only one group, frequently the 
writer’s group. 

2. Bias by defamation: calling attention to the faults and ignoring the virtues of an individual 
or group. 

3. Bias by disparagement: denying or belittling the contributions of an identifiable group of 
people in the Canadian culture. 

4. Bias by cumulative implication: constantly creating the impression that only one group is 
responsible for positive development. 

5. Bias by (lack of) validity: failing to ensure that information about issues is always accurate 
and unambiguous. 

6. Bias by inertia: perpetuation of myths and half-truths by failure to keep abreast of historical 
scholarship. 

7. Bias by obliteration: ignoring significant aspects of the history of a cultural or minority group 
in Canada. 

8. Bias by disembodiment: referring in a casual and depersonalized way to the historical role 
of identifiable cultural and minority groups. 

9. Bias by (lack of) concreteness: dealing with a cultural group in platitudes and generalizations 
(applying the shortcomings of one individual to a whole group). To be concrete, the material 
must be factual, objective, and realistic. 

10. Bias by (lack of) comprehensiveness: failing to mention all relevant facts that may help the 
student to form an opinion.

to a breakdown of the spiritual bond between the 
Natives and the animals they hunted. Calvin argues 
that the Native people believed the animals were 
responsible for the epidemic of diseases. The authors

Yerbury, J.C. 

The Subarctic Indians and the Fur Trade , 1680-1860. 
Vancouver: University of British Columbia Press, 

1986. 

In examining the fur trade of northwestern Canada, 
Yerbury divides the era into ‘periods’ of the trade: the 
protohistoric, the early fur trade (1770-1800); the 
competitive phase (1800-1821); and the trading post 
dependency period (1821-1860). Yerbury contends that 
previous studies on the extent of change that had 
occurred in the lives of Athapascan Natives before the 
appearance of permanent trading posts on their land has 
been seriously underestimated. He believes and argues 
that the culture and environment of the Aboriginal 
people of the region began to change at an early phase 
of outside contact with Europeans.

to break down stereotypes by showing Native families 
in Regina that have successfully adjusted to mainstream 
life in the city.

cultures to Ottawa’s "bureaucratization" of the north 
and discusses how today’s northern politics has 
developed from these events. Coates argues that the 
business community and federal government has a 
tendency only to become involved in the Arctic when 
it is of direct benefit or concern to the south.
