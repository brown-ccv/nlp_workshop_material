Young children's conceptions of Native Americans often develop out of media portrayals 
and classroom role playing of the events of the First Thanksgiving. The conception of 
Native Americans gained from such early exposure is both inaccurate and potentially 
damaging to others. For example, a visitor to a child care center heard a four-year-old 
saying, "Indians aren't people. They're all dead." This child had already acquired an 
inaccurate view of Native Americans, even though her classmates were children of 
many cultures, including a Native American child. Derman-Sparks (1989) asserts that 
by failing to challenge existing biases we allow children to adopt attitudes based on 
inaccuracies. Fler book is a guide for developing curriculum materials that reflect cultural 
diversity. This digest seeks to build on this effort by focusing on teaching children in 
early childhood classrooms about Native Americans. Note that this digest, though it 
uses the term "Native American," recognizes and respects the common use of the term 
"American Indian" to describe the indigenous people of North America. While it is most 
accurate to use the tribal name when speaking of a specific tribe, there is no definitive 
preference for the use of "Native American" or "American Indian" among tribes or in the 
general literature. 

STEREOTYPES CHILDREN SEE 



Most young children are familiar with stereotypes of the Native American. Stereotypes 
are perpetuated by television, movies, and children's literature when they depict Native 
Americans negatively, as uncivilized, simple, superstitious, blood-thirsty savages, or 
positively, as romanticized heroes living in harmony with nature (Grant & Gillespie, 
1992). The Disney Company presents both images in its films for children. For example, 
in the film PETER PAN, Princess Tiger Lily's father represents the negative stereotype 
as he holds Wendy's brothers hostage, while in the film POCAFIONTAS, Pocahontas 
represents the positive stereotype who respects the earth and communicates with the 
trees and animals. 

Many popular children's authors unwittingly perpetuate stereotypes. Richard Scarry's 
books frequently contain illustrations of animals dressed in buckskin and feathers, while 
Mercer Mayer's alphabet book includes an alligator dressed as an Indian. Both authors 
present a dehumanized image, in which anyone or anything can become Native 
American simply by putting on certain clothes. TEN LITTLE RABBITS, although 
beautifully illustrated, dehumanizes Native Americans by turning them into objects for 
counting. BROTHER EAGLE, SISTER SKY (Harris, 1993) contains a speech delivered 
by Chief Seattle of the Squamish tribe in the northwestern United States. However, 
Susan Jeffers' illustrations are of the Plains Indians, and include fringed buckskin 
clothes and teepees, rather than Squamish clothing and homes. 

AN ACCURATE PICTURE OF NATIVE AMERICANS IN THE 1990s 

Native Americans make up less than one percent of the total U.S. population but 
represent half the languages and cultures in the nation. The term "Native American"

includes over 500 different groups and reflects great diversity of geographic location, 
language, socioeconomic conditions, school experience, and retention of traditional 
spiritual and cultural practices. However, most of the commercially prepared teaching 
materials available present a generalized image of Native American people with little or 
no regard for differences that exist from tribe to tribe. 

TEACHING SUGGESTIONS 



When teachers engage young children in project work, teachers should choose 
concrete topics in order to enable children to draw on their own understanding. In 
teaching about Native Americans, the most relevant, interactive experience would be to 
have Native American children in the classroom. Such experience makes feasible 
implementing anti-bias curriculum suggestions. Teachers may want to implement the 
project approach (Katz & Chard, 1989), as it will allow children to carry on an in-depth 
investigation of a culture they have direct experience with. In these situations, teachers 
may prepare themselves for working with Native American families by engaging in what 
Emberton (1994) calls "cultural homework": reading current information about the 
families' tribe, tribal history, and traditional recreational and spiritual activities; and 
learning the correct pronunciation of personal names. 

POSITIVE STRATEGIES 



A number of positive strategies can be used in classrooms, regardless of whether 
Native American children are members of the class. 

1 . PROVIDE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT CONTEMPORARY NATIVE AMERICANS to 
balance historical information. Teaching about Native Americans exclusively from a 
historical perspective may perpetuate the idea that they exist only in the past. 

2. PREPARE UNITS ABOUT SPECIFIC TRIBES, rather than units about "Native 
Americans." For example, develop a unit about the people of Nambe Pueblo, the Turtle 
Mountain Chippewa, the Potawotami. Ideally, choose a tribe with a historical or 
contemporary role in the local community. Such a unit will provide children with 
culturally specific knowledge (pertaining to a single group) rather than overgeneralized 
stereotypes. 

3. LOCATE AND USE BOOKS THAT SHOW CONTEMPORARY CHILDREN OF ALL 
COLORS ENGAGED IN THEIR USUAL, DAILY ACTIVITIES playing basketball, riding 
bicycles as well as traditional activities. Make the books easily accessible to children 
throughout the school year. Three excellent titles on the Pueblo Indians of New Mexico 
are: PUEBLO STORYTELLER, by Diane Hoyt-Goldsmith; PUEBLO BOY: GROWING 
UP IN TWO WORLDS, by Marcia Keegan; and CHILDREN OF CLAY, by Rina 
Swentzell. 

4. OBTAIN POSTERS THAT SHOW NATIVE AMERICAN CHILDREN IN 



ED394744 1996-05-00 Teaching Young Children about Native Americans. ERIC Digest.

CONTEMPORARY CONTEXTS, especially when teaching younger elementary 
children. When selecting historical posters for use with older children, make certain that 
the posters are culturally authentic and that you know enough about the tribe depicted 
to share authentic information with your students. 

5. USE "PERSONA" DOLLS (dolls with different skin colors) in the dramatic play area of 
the classroom on a daily basis. Dress them in the same clothing (t-shirts, jeans) children 
in the United States typically wear and bring out special clothing (for example, manta, 
shawl, moccasins, turquoise jewelry for Pueblo girls) for dolls only on special days. 

6. COOK ETHNIC FOODS but be careful not to imply that all members of a particular 
group eat a specific food. 

7. BE SPECIFIC ABOUT WHICH TRIBES USE PARTICULAR ITEMS, when discussing 
cultural artifacts (such as clothing or housing) and traditional foods. The Plains tribes 
use feathered headdresses, for example, but not all other tribes use them. 

8. CRITIOUE A THANKSGIVING POSTER DEPICTING THE TRADITIONAL, 
STEREOTYPED PILGRIM AND INDIAN FIGURES, especially when teaching older 
elementary school children. Take care to select a picture that most children are familiar 
with, such as those shown on grocery bags or holiday greeting cards. Critically analyze 
the poster, noting the many tribes the artist has combined into one general image that 
fails to provide accurate information about any single tribe (Stutzman, 1993). 

9. AT THANKSGIVING, SHIFT THE FOCUS AWAY FROM REENACTING THE "FIRST 
THANKSGIVING." Instead, focus on items children can be thankful for in their own lives, 
and on their families' celebrations of Thanksgiving at home. 

Besides using these strategies in their classrooms, teachers need to educate 
themselves. MacCann (1993) notes that stereotyping is not always obvious to people 
surrounded by mainstream culture. Numerous guidelines have been prepared to aid in 
the selection of materials that work against stereotypes (for example, see Slapin and 
Seale [1992]). 

PRACTICES TO AVOID 



AVOID USING OVER-GENERALIZED BOOKS, curriculum guides, and lesson plans; 
and teaching kits with a "Native American" theme. Although the goal of these materials 
is to teach about other cultures in positive ways, most of the materials group Native 
Americans too broadly. When seeking out materials, look for those which focus on a 
single tribe. 

AVOID THE "TOURIST CURRICULUM" as described by Derman-Sparks. This kind of 
curriculum teaches predominantly through celebrations and seasonal holidays, and 
through traditional food and artifacts. It teaches in isolated units rather than in an

integrated way and emphasizes exotic differences, focusing on specific events rather 
than on daily life. 

AVOID PRESENTING SACRED ACTIVITIES IN TRIVIAL WAYS. In early childhood 
classrooms, for example, a popular activity involves children in making headbands with 
feathers, even though feathers are highly religious articles for some tribes. By way of 
example, consider how a devout Catholic might feel about children making a chalice out 
of paper cups and glitter. 

AVOID INTRODUCING THE TOPIC OF NATIVE 
AMERICANS ON COLUMBUS 

DAY OR AT THANKSGIVING. Doing so perpetuates the idea that Native 
Americans do not exist in the present. 



CONCLUSIONMuch remains to be done to counter stereotypes of Native Americans 
learned by young children in our society. Teachers must provide accurate instruction not 
only about history but also about the contemporary lives of Native Americans.
