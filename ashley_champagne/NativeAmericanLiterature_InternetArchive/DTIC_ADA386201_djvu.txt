Abstract 

From the end of the seventeenth century to the mid-nineteenth century, Spain (and later Mexico) made 
land grants to individuals, towns, and groups to promote development in the frontier lands that now 
constitute the American Southwest. In New Mexico, these land grants fulfilled several purposes: to 
encourage settlement, reward patrons of the Spanish government, and create a buffer zone to separate 
hostile Native American tribes from the more populated regions of New Spain. Spain also extended land 
grants to several indigenous pueblo cultures, which had occupied the areas granted long before Spanish 
settlers arrived in the Southwest. Under Spanish and Mexican law, common land was set aside as part of 
the original grant for the use of the entire community. Literature on land grants in New Mexico and 
popular terminology generally distinguish between two kinds of land grants: community land grants and 
individual land grants. Our research identified a total of 295 grants made by Spain and Mexico during this 
period. Appendix I contains a list of these grants.

The Honorable Jeff Bingaman 
United States Senate 

From the end of the seventeenth century to the mid-nineteenth century, 
Spain (and later Mexico) made land grants to individuals, towns, and 
groups to promote development in the frontier lands that now constitute 
the American Southwest. In New Mexico, these land grants fulfilled several 
purposes: to encourage settlement, reward patrons of the Spanish 
government, and create a buffer zone to separate hostile Native American 
tribes from the more populated regions of New Spain. Spain also extended 
land grants to several indigenous pueblo cultures, which had occupied the 
areas granted long before Spanish settlers arrived in the Southwest. Under 
Spanish and Mexican law, common land was set aside as part of the original 
grant for the use of the entire community. Literature on land grants in New 
Mexico and popular terminology generally distinguish between two kinds 
of land grants: “community land grants” and “individual land grants.” Our 
research identified a total of 295 grants made by Spain and Mexico during 
this period. Appendix I contains a list of these grants. 

With the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, which formally ended the 
Mexican-American War, the United States assumed control over vast new 
territories, including much of what is now the state of New Mexico. Under 
the treaty, the United States agreed to recognize ownership of property, 
including the ownership of land grants, in the ceded areas. Over the next 
half century, the United States developed procedures to validate land 
grants in the territory of New Mexico in order to implement the treaty 
provisions. Whether the United States carried out the provisions of the 
treaty, especially with regard to community land grants, has been a 
controversial issue for generations. Many persons, including grantee heirs, 
scholars, and legal experts, still claim that the United States did not protect 
the property of Mexican-Americans and their descendants, particularly the 
common lands of community land grants. They charge that the common 
lands were lost in many ways and that this loss threatened the economic 
stability of small Mexican-American farms and the farmers’ rural lifestyle. 

Concerned that the Congress and the courts have validated only about 25 
percent of the total land grant claims in New Mexico and that most of the 
lost lands stemmed from community land grants, you asked us to answer 
several questions concerning community land grants and procedures under

the treaty. In this report, the first in a series, we agreed to (1) define the 
concept of community land grants and (2) identify the types of community 
land grants in New Mexico that meet the definition. Subsequently, we will 
describe the procedures established to implement the treaty, identify 
concerns about how the treaty was implemented, and what alternatives, if 
any are needed, may be available to address these concerns. 

To define community land grants, we reviewed land grant documents filed 
with the U.S. government; Spanish colonial, Mexican, and current New 
Mexican laws; federal, state, and territorial court cases; and the land grant 
literature. To identify land grants meeting the definition of community land 
grants, we reviewed U.S. records on Spanish and Mexican land grant 
claims; literature on land grants, including materials on specific grants; and 
federal court cases. We also spoke with scholars, legal experts, and grant 
heirs familiar with the issues. For the most part, we relied on English 
translations of Spanish documents in U.S. government files and other 
sources. Our identification of a land grant as a community land grant in this 
report, however, does not constitute our opinion as to the validity of any 
land grant claim. Many of these land grants have already been subject to 
congressional review or court adjudication. Appendix II contains a 
complete description of our methodology. 

We are issuing this report as an Exposure Draft in English and Spanish to 
gather and to identify information on community land grants that was not 
readily available to us in published research and public documents. We 
would also like to obtain comments about our definition and our 
identification of community land grants. We will use such information and 
comments when preparing our final report. The NOTICE located on the 
inside cover of this report provides information about how additional 
copies of the Exposure Draft can be obtained and when and to whom 
comments should be sent. 


Results in Brief Land grant documents contain no direct reference to “community land 

grants” nor do Spanish and Mexican laws define or use this term. We did 
find, however, that some grants refer to lands set aside for general 
communal use ( ejidos ) or for specific purposes, including hunting (caza), 
pasture (pastos), wood gathering (leha), or watering (abrevederos). 
Scholars, the land grant literature, and popular terminology commonly use 
the phrase “community land grants” to denote land grants that set aside 
common lands for the use of the entire community. We adopted this broad 


Page 6 


GAO-01-330 Guadalupe Hidalgo Exposure Draft 


definition in determining which Spanish and Mexican land grants can be 
identified as community land grants. 

We identified 152 community land grants (or 52 percent) out of the total of 
295 land grants in New Mexico. We divided these community land grants 
into three distinct types: 79 of these were grants in which the shared lands 
formed part of the grant according to the original grant documentation; 51 
were grants that scholars, grantee heirs, or others believed to contain 
common lands; and 22 were grants extended to the indigenous pueblo 
cultures in New Mexico. 


Background 


From the end of the seventeenth century to the middle of the nineteenth 
century, Spain and Mexico issued grants of land to individuals, groups, 
towns, pueblos, and other settlements in order to populate present-day 
New Mexico. Academic treatises and popular literature typically divide 
these grants into two types: “individual grants” and “community land 
grants.” Grants to towns and other settlements were modeled on similar 
communities created in Spain, where the king granted lands adjacent to 
small towns for common use by all town residents. Under Spanish and 
Mexican law in the territory of New Mexico, officials made grants to towns 
and other communities. Such grants were in keeping with Spanish laws, 
including the 1680 Recopilacion de las Leyes de los Reynos de las Indias. 
However, local laws, practices, and customs often dictated how grants 
were made and confirmed. 

After achieving independence from Spain in 1821, Mexico continued to 
adhere to Spanish law by extending additional land grants to individuals to 
encourage settlements in unoccupied areas and to stave off U.S. 
encroachment on Mexican territory. The Mexican-American War began in 
1846 and formally ended with the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe 
Hidalgo in 1848. Under the treaty, Mexico ceded most of what is presently 
the American Southwest, including the present day states of New Mexico 
and California, to the United States for $15 million. Figure 1 shows the 
territory ceded by Mexico under the treaty.

a When Texas was officially recognized as a state in 1845, it included the light-gray area, which was 
also claimed by Mexico. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo resolved this dispute, with Texas claiming 
the disputed land. In 1850, Texas transferred part of this land to the federal government, which became 
the eastern portion of the territory of New Mexico. 

While the treaty provided protection for property in the ceded area, Article 
X expressly addressed land grant protection. However, U.S. President 
James Polk objected to the provision, fearing that a revival of land grant 
claims had the potential to jeopardize the grants already settled in Texas. 
As a result, the Congress struck Article X before ratifying the treaty. 
Subsequently, in 1848, the United States and Mexico signed the Protocol of 
Queretaro, which clarified certain aspects of the treaty, including Article 2, 
in which the United States stated that the exclusion of Article X in no way 
meant that it planned to annul the land grants. The Protocol specifically 
provided that land grant titles would be protected under the treaty and that

grantees could have their ownership of land acknowledged before 
American tribunals. With the Gadsden Purchase of 1853, the United States 
purchased additional land from Mexico for $15 million, including the 
southwest comer of the present state of New Mexico. The treaty, which 
confirmed the terms of the Gadsden Purchase, incorporated by reference 
the property provisions of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. 

To implement the treaties, the Congress enacted legislation in 1854 to 
establish the Office of Surveyor General of New Mexico. The surveyors 
general were charged with examining documents and verifying the 
ownership of land grants. The United States government required 
individuals or towns and other communities to prove ownership or 
property interests in grant lands. After reviewing the land grant 
documentation, the surveyor general recommended to the Congress which 
grants should be rejected or confirmed. If the Congress approved the grant, 
the U.S. government issued a patent, which conveyed the property’s title to 
the owner. The Congress reviewed and confirmed 64 of the surveyor 
generals’ recommendations, but in the late 1870s, the congressional review 
of recommendations ceased. 

In 1891, the Congress established the Court of Private Land Claims to 
adjudicate the outstanding claims reviewed by the surveyors general, 
though not yet approved by the Congress, and other claims presented to 
the court. In United States v. Sandoval etal., 167 U.S. 278 (1897), a case on 
appeal from the Court of Private Land Claims, the Supreme Court held that 
Mexico, not the local community, had title to all common lands in 
community land grants issued before 1848. Consequently, under the Treaty 
of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Mexico had transferred ownership of these 
communal lands to the United States. Although the Sandoval decision did 
not overturn previous court confirmations of land grants, it did affect all 
subsequent claims adjudicated by the Court of Private Land Claims. In 
1904, the court finished its work, approving claims and land surveys that 
represented approximately 6 percent of the acreage claimed. The Congress 
and the Court of Private Land Claims confirmed 155 grants of the total of 
295 grants we identified, and patents were issued for 142 of these grants. 
Appendix I lists all the land grants we identified, the grants patented, and 
the acreage patented. 

The completion of the Court of Private Land Claims’ work did not quell the 
controversy surrounding the loss of the common lands. Many persons, 
including grantee heirs, scholars, and legal experts, still claim that the 
United States failed to uphold the provisions of the Treaty of Guadalupe

GAO-01-330 Guadalupe Hidalgo Exposure Draft 



Hidalgo to protect the property of Mexican-Americans and their 
descendants. They are critical of the federal courts’ treatment of the 
common lands and the failure to approve more of the acreage claimed. 
They also assert that common lands were lost by other means, and that this 
loss deprived many small Mexican-American farmers of their livelihoods. 


Land grant documents contain no direct reference to “community land 
grants” nor do Spanish and Mexican laws define or use this term. Scholars, 
land grant literature, and popular terminology use the phrase “community 
land grants” to denote land grants that set aside common lands for the use 
of the entire community. We adopted this broad definition for the purposes 
of this report. 

To determine the meaning of the term “community land grants,” we first 
reviewed land grant documents, and found that grant documents do not 
describe grants as community land grants. We also did not find applicable 
Spanish and Mexican laws that defined or used the term. However, as a 
result of our review of land grant literature, court decisions, and interviews 
with scholars, legal experts, and grantee heirs, we found that the term is 
frequently used to refer to grants that set aside some land for general 
communal use ( ejidos ) or for specific purposes, including hunting (caza), 
pasture (pastos), wood gathering (Jena), or watering ( abrevederos ). Our 
definition coincides with the way in which scholars, the land grant 
literature, and grant heirs use the term. 

Under Spanish and Mexican law, common lands set aside as part of an 
original grant could not be sold. Typically, in addition to use of common 
lands, settlers on a community land grant would receive individual parcels 
of land designated for dwelling (solar de casa) and growing food ( suerte ). 
Unlike the common lands, these individual parcels could be sold or 
otherwise disposed of by a settler who fulfilled the requirements of the 
grant, such as occupying the individual parcel for a continuous period. For 
example, the documentation for the Anton Chico grant, issued by Mexico in 
1822, contains evidence that common lands were part of the original grant. 
The granting document provided for individual private allotments and 
common lands. Congress confirmed the Anton Chico grant in 1860 and the 
grant was patented in 1883.

Using the definition, we identified three types of community land grants, 
totaling 152 grants, or approximately 52 percent of the 295 land grants in 
New Mexico. In 79 of the community land grants, the common lands 
formed part of the grant according to the grant documentation. Scholars, 
grant heirs, and others have found an additional 51 grants that they believe 
to contain communal lands; and we located 22 grants of communal lands to 
the indigenous pueblo cultures in New Mexico. Figure 2 shows the 
location, by county, of the three types of community land grants.

Common Lands Formed 
Part of the Grant According 
to Grant Documentation 


The first type of community land grant we identified is a grant in which 
common lands formed part of the original grant. From our review of grant 
documents, Spanish and Mexican law, New Mexican law, and grant 
literature, as well as interviews with grantee heirs, scholars, legal experts, 
and others, common lands were part of the original grant in the following 
three instances: 


• The grant document itself declares part of the land be made available for 
communal use, using such terms as “common lands” or “pasturage and 
water in common.” We identified 29 grants that contain this or similar 
language. For example, the 1815 Spanish Los Trigos grant, which was 
issued to three individuals, made pasture available to the settlers of the 
grant. Also, an 1846 Mexican land grant provided land to John Scolly and 
several associates, to set aside wood and common pasture for the use of 
all the settlers. Current New Mexico law treats grants that make specific 
reference to common lands as community land grants. 1 

• The grant was made for the purpose of establishing a town or other new 
settlement. Spanish laws and customs concerning territories in the New 
World provided that new settlements, cities, and towns would include 
common lands. Although Mexico obtained its independence in 1821, 
Mexican land grants continued to follow Spanish laws and customs. We 
identified 13 grants as Spanish and Mexican grants to towns. For 
example, in 1768, Spain issued the Ojo de San Jose grant to six 
individuals for the purpose of establishing a town. Similarly, Mexico 
issued the Dona Ana Bend Colony grant in 1840 to 116 petitioners to 
establish a town, which would then set aside an area for the town 
commons. New Mexico law currently considers grants to a town, 
community, colony, pueblo, or individual for the purpose of establishing 
a town to be community land grants. 2 

• The grant was issued to 10 or more settlers. Spanish law governing 
settlement in the New World stated that 10 or more married persons 
could obtain a land grant, if they agreed to form a settlement indicating 
that a grant would contain common lands. For example, the 1807 
Spanish Juan Bautista Valdez grant was made to 10 settlers and the 1842

The second type of community land grant we identified is a grant that a 
person or persons stated included common lands. Our review of the papers 
filed with each grant claim to the surveyors general and the Court of 
Private Land Claims, and those of a legal scholar, 3 disclosed that, in some 
instances, the only mention of common lands was found in a claimant’s 
petition or other documents. In these cases, the files did not contain any 
grant documents showing that the common lands were part of the original 
grant. 

We also identified grants in this category as community land grants after 
interviewing grantee heirs, scholars, and others knowledgeable about a 
grant’s history, and reviewing other information provided to us. Again, no 
existing grant document supported the claim, although some claimants 
stated that such documentation had been lost or destroyed. Furthermore, 
some scholars raised the issue that, in some individual grants, common 
lands had been set aside by the grantees, their heirs, or other grant settlers 
to encourage additional settlement after the original grant was made. In 
these instances, there would not be any supporting official documentation 
because the grant predated the setting aside of common lands. For 
example, one scholar believed that the Sangre de Cristo grant, which 
Mexico originally issued as an individual grant in 1843, later evolved into a 
community land grant when an heir of the original grantee provided land to 
new settlers and set aside additional land for communal use. 

Table 2 lists the 51 grants identified by grantee heirs, scholars, or others as 
having common lands but lacking grant documentation.

Common Lands of 
Indigenous Pueblo Cultures 
Antedated Arrival of 
Spanish Explorers 


The third type of community land grants we identified encompasses grants 
extended by Spain to the indigenous pueblo cultures in New Mexico to 
protect communal lands that had existed for centuries before the Spanish 
settlers arrived. For the most part, the pueblo settlements these colonists 
encountered in the sixteenth century were permanent, communally owned 
villages, where inhabitants engaged in agricultural pursuits. Spain declared 
itself guardian of these communities, respected their rights to land adjacent 
to the pueblos, and protected pueblo lands from encroachment by Spanish 
colonists. Spain made grants to these communities in recognition of their 
communal ownership of village lands. Mexico continued to recognize 
pueblo ownership of land and considered pueblo residents to be Mexican 
citizens.

GAO-01-330 Guadalupe Hidalgo Exposure Draft 



After the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the Congress required the Surveyor 
General to investigate and report on pueblo claims. The Congress 
subsequently confirmed Spanish grants to 22 pueblos on the 
recommendation of the Surveyor General. Table 3 lists the pueblo grants.

Yturbide Colony Grant. A patent was not issued because claimants argue the Confirmation Act of 
1860 conveyed the title; a final survey yielded 14,808.075 acres. 

e The grant was located within the confirmed Domingo Fernandez grant, so no action was taken on the 
claim. 

f Based on a U.S. Supreme Court decision that found, among other things, that the grant had not been 
given in accordance with Mexican law. 

g The grant apparently lies within the Pueblo of Nambe grant, and has not been patented. 

h No actual claim was presented to the Court, and therefore no actual confirmation was made by either 
the Congress or the Court. When the Majada grant was confirmed, this was apparently sufficient for 
the Town of Pena Blanca residents. In 1931, the New Mexico District Court confirmed acreage not 
previously part of the Pueblo of Cochiti lands. 

'The Town of Las Vegas grant was apparently in conflict with the Baca grant. The Congress recognized 
the conflict and allowed the Baca heirs to obtain equivalent acreage elsewhere in the Territory. Of five 
tracts selected two were in New Mexico, known as Float # 1 (Sandoval County) and Float # 2 (San 
Miguel County), each containing 99,289.39 acres. 

j The claimants probably obtained title through the Act of March 3, 1891. This act allowed those settlers, 
who had lived on the land for more than 20 years before an official survey of a township was 
conducted, to a patent of up to 160 acres of land. There was no documentation of the grant, and no 
claim was submitted to the Court of Private Land Claims. 

k No specific information is available. 

'The purported grant document was filed with the Surveyor General but was later proven to be 
fraudulent. 

m As the result of the establishment of a reservation in 1877, as revised in 1883, 1885, and 1917, the 
pueblo’s claim was not presented to the Court of Private Land Claims. 

n The only grant actually given to Santa Fe residents was for some common pasture land and water 
(1715). Congress ultimately granted to the City of Santa Fe all lands not already used by the United 
States or confirmed as private land grants. The confirmed amount is based on the Surveyor General’s 
preliminary survey of 4 square leagues. 

°The U.S. Supreme Court found the Court of Private Land Claims in error and directed a reversal. The 
grant was rejected in 1900. 

p Although a petition was filed in 1872, no further action was taken by the claimants to pursue 
recognition of the claim. Therefore, there is no formal decision on the matter.

Appendix II 


Objectives, Scope, and Methodology 


Concerned about whether the United States fulfilled its obligations under 
the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo with regard to community land grants 
made by Spain and Mexico in what is now the state of New Mexico, 
Senators Pete Domenici and Jeff Bingaman asked us to study numerous 
issues regarding the treaty and its implementation. We plan to answer their 
questions in a series of reports. This first report defines the concept of 
community land grants, identifies three types of grants that meet this 
definition, and lists the grants we identified in each category. 

In accordance with the request, we limited our review to community land 
grants made by Spain or Mexico between 1689 and 1846 that are now either 
wholly or partially situated within the area of what is now the state of New 
Mexico and that were subject to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. We also 
included grants in what is now New Mexico made up to 1853 that were part 
of the Gadsden Purchase, since they too are subject to the Treaty. We 
analyzed land grants in New Mexico for which we could find evidence to 
identify community land grants. 

To respond to this request, we collected and reviewed documents from the 
U.S. National Archives and Records Administration in Washington, D.C.; 
the National Archives and Records Administration in Denver; the New 
Mexico State Records Center and Archives; archives at the U.S. Bureau of 
Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service; various libraries, including 
the Center for Southwest Research at the University of New Mexico 
Zimmerman Library and the Special Collections at the University of New 
Mexico Law School Library; the U.S. National Park Service’s Spanish 
Colonial Research Center at the University of New Mexico; scholars, land 
grant heirs, lawyers representing land grant interests; and other individuals 
or entities associated with land grants in New Mexico. 

We researched, collected, and reviewed published and unpublished 
material on land grants, including books, articles, monographs and 
unpublished theses. Our search for relevant materials included a search for 
articles published in Mexico that address the issues in this report. A list of 
materials consulted can be found in appendix III. 

During the course of our review, we interviewed dozens of land grant heirs 
in New Mexico and a representative of a pueblo; historians, researchers, 
and other academicians studying land grant issues, including scholars in 
Mexico; lawyers representing the interests of land grant heirs and an Indian 
pueblo; officials at the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the 
U.S. Forest Service; local government officials with the state of New

Mexico, including the Office of the Attorney General, and with several 
counties in which land grants exist; and various representatives of other 
entities or interests associated with land grant issues in New Mexico to 
gain a better understanding of community land grant issues. 

To determine how community land grants are defined, we reviewed 
numerous documents that addressed land grants in New Mexico, including 
English translations of original grant documents; English translations of 
Spanish and Mexican laws; federal, state, and territorial court decisions on 
land grants; scholarly articles describing customs associated with land 
grants; and various academic materials analyzing land grants. In interviews 
with academicians and other experts on land grants, lawyers dealing with 
land grant issues or cases, land grant heirs, and other observers of land 
grants (e.g., federal employees, librarians, graduate students at the 
University of New Mexico Law School Library and University of New 
Mexico Library), we asked for their views on defining community land 
grants. We also asked several experts to comment on our preliminary 
definition of community land grants. 

To identify the universe of Spanish and Mexican land grants in New 
Mexico, we used a variety of historical data. We started with an 
unpublished master of laws (LL.M.) thesis by J. J. Bowden at Southern 
Methodist University Law School, entitled Private Land Claims in the 
Southwest, to develop our initial list of Spanish and Mexican grants. This 
six-volume thesis describes 280 grants in great detail and includes English 
translations of parts of the granting documents. The work also identifies 
many of the different names for the grants. We next examined documents 
on file at various archives from the Surveyor General and Court of Private 
Land Claims—the two entities responsible for carrying out the legal 
processes set in place in the nineteenth century to implement the treaty. 
Where possible, we reviewed English translations of the original granting 
documents. We also used other sources of information, including those 
provided by land grant heirs. If discrepancies were found among various 
documents, we deferred to documents in the archives from the Surveyor 
General or Court of Private Land Claims files. 

To distill community land grants from this universe of land grants, we 
applied our definition, searching for clues in the granting documents and 
other sources. For example, some grants contained the following language 
and would be considered community land grants: “pasturage and watering 
places shall be in common” (Caja del Rio), the “pastures and woodlands in 
common” (Barranca), “the public square is also common among all” 


Page 34 


GAO-01-330 Guadalupe Hidalgo Exposure Draft 




Appendix II 

Objectives, Scope, and Methodology 


(Canon de Camue), and “set aside for the commons of the town” (Dona 
Ana Bend Colony). Criteria for inclusion as a community land grant 
included not just language denoting common lands but language indicating 
that a grant had been made to a town or settlement, since under Spanish 
law and custom, grants to towns included common lands. We also included 
grants made to 10 or more people, since Spanish law states in the 
Recopilacion de las Leyes de los Reynos de las Indias that a grant could be 
made to 10 or more married persons to form a settlement, indicating that 
the grant was a community grant. 

Historical treatises and interviews with scholars and grant heirs alerted us 
to the possibility of additional community grants. Although grants may 
have originally been issued to individuals, sometimes land was 
subsequently set aside for common use and thus these grants should be 
considered community land grants. Such evolutions are not captured in 
grant documents. Other grant heirs and advocates assert that certain grants 
are community land grants, but we do not know the basis for the assertion. 
We included grants identified by heirs and others as being community land 
grants in a second list. We make no judgment as to the efficacy of these 
assertions but list them for the Congress’ consideration. 

We also found that Spain issued land grants to indigenous pueblo cultures 
already resident in the colonial territories. According to scholars, these 
cultures held the lands communally. We list these grants separately because 
the lands in common existed before Spanish settlement and because of the 
unique relationship between Native Americans and the Spanish, Mexican 
and U.S. governments. We used surveyor general documents and public 
laws to ascertain the number of grants made to Native Americans. 

To list each land grant by county, we compared county data in several 
federal, state, and independent databases listing New Mexican land grants 
to determine the level of reliability of the databases. We also recognized 
that the county boundaries have changed markedly since 1850. We found 
significant discrepancies among the various databases because of, in part, 
conflicting interpretations of which county contained the largest area when 
a grant straddled county lines. This is particularly problematic in 
unsurveyed grants. In an effort to maintain consistency in listing counties 
and to minimize errors, we used official federal, state, and county 
government maps and the unpublished thesis of J. J. Bowden entitled 
Private Land Claims in the Southwest. The maps relied on actual survey 
data of certain land grants. We visually reviewed the maps to determine the 
primary county for each of the land grants illustrated. However, we 


Page 35 


GAO-01-330 Guadalupe Hidalgo Exposure Draft 




Appendix II 

Objectives, Scope, and Methodology 


recognized that the maps contained limited information. We therefore used 
J. J. Bowden’s thesis, one of the more thorough reports on land grants in 
New Mexico, to complete the county listings. We did not verify the 
accuracy of either the official maps or of J. J. Bowden’s thesis. 

In creating the map to represent the location of each land grant, we learned 
that no map illustrating all grants existed. Officials from federal and state 
agencies, as well as independent researchers, told us that current maps 
only listed certain land grants, such as those grants that had been 
confirmed and surveyed. 

It should be noted that we relied on published and unpublished documents 
and archives, primarily in New Mexico, Colorado and Washington, D.C. The 
quantity, quality, availability and reliability of the evidence for the various 
grants varied considerably. For example, the Dona Ana Bend Colony files 
contain extensive documents pertaining to the establishment of the colony 
and the location of tracts, while the Hacienda del Alamo file contains only 
the claimant’s petition with no original grant documents to verify the claim. 
We relied on official translations of the original granting documents 
wherever possible. The Surveyor General’s office included an individual 
responsible for translating the documents submitted. However, we did not 
independently assess any translation. We also note that the names of some 
grants in Private Land Claims in the Southwest, the Surveyor General 
documents, and the Court of Private Land Claims files are not always 
consistent. We have identified the other names of grants in appendix I. 

We conducted our review from April through December 2000, according to 
generally accepted government auditing standards.
