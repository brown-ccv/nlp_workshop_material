ABSTRACT 



This performance guide is designed for teachers to use with 
students before and after a storytelling performance of "Coyote and Spider 
Woman and Other Creation Stories," by Geri Keams, a Navajo storyteller. The 
guide, called a "Cuesheet," contains seven activity sheets for use in class, 
addressing: (1) The Storyteller Tells Her Story (where the storyteller 

describes the importance of storytelling as she was growing up and discusses 
her work); (2) Telling Stories (discussing why tell stories, what makes good 
storytelling- -including words, voice, facial expressions, and body movements, 
and listeners who are partners- -and what makes a story worth telling); (3) 

The Stories (providing some information about two stories and offering a Venn 
diagram for story discussion) ; (4) Picturing a Story (with an illustration 

activity for students based on the performance they attended) ; and (5) What 
Did You Learn? (an activity sheet to show what students learned about Native 
Americans from listening to these stories) . Resources for further exploration 
are listed. (SR) 



Reproductions supplied by EDRS are the best that can be made

Meet Geri Keams 

& 'Weaver of 1/Vbrcfs" 



■vvas born and raised on the Navajo Nation in the 
■Painted Desert region of Arizona. (The government 

■ called this a reservation.) I belong to the Streak-of- 

■ Black-Forest Clan. 1 am the oldest of nine brothers and 
sisters. My grandmother, a storyteller and rug weaver, was 
a great influence on me. She taught me the importance of 
remembering and carrying on our ancient tribal stories 
and chants. Winter was storytelling time, and my grand- 
mother made us travel to the homes of others, sometimes 
walking two or three miles, to hear their stories. 

In addition to being a storyteller, I am an actress. I 
was in a movie, The Outlaw Josie Wales, with Clint 
Eastwood. I have been in TV movies and series such as 
Northern Exposure I also starred in a children's televi- 
sion film, The Secret of Lizard Woman. 

I perform at schools, museums, churches, and per- 
forming arts centers all around the United States. I love 



telling stories, because it gives me the chance to combine 
the traditions of my Navajo ancestors with my life today. 

I have published several poems, as well as a children’s 
book, Grandmother Spider Brings the Sun. 

I graduated from the University of Arizona, where I 
studied Drama Education. 

I live in Los Angeles, California, and I’m president of 
my own company, Hozhoni Productions. Hozhoni is a 
Navajo word that means “the beauty' way" — a way of 
balance and harmony. I help the “storytellers” of 
Hollywood by suggesting how they should show Native 
Americans in their movies and on TV. I have worked on 
TV shows like Beverly Hills 90210, The X-Fi/es, and 
Profiler. I also helped with the Disney movie Pocahontas I 
made suggestions about Pocahontas’s family, and about 
her tribe's opinion of the European setders. At the end of 
the movie credits, you can find my name! 






Why Tell Stories / 

All Native American tribes have 
legends and stories that were told 
to explain things that people 
didn't understand, such as 
earthquakes, storms, 
and seasons. Creation 
stories explain the 
origins of the 
earth, sun, moon, 
stars, and all of 
nature. Other 
stories tell 
about gods and 
heroes, and 
remind people 
about how they 
should act and 
the rules they 
should follow. 

Some stories are 
told just for fun. 
while others teach 
lessons, or morals. 

Through stories, each 
generation passes its religion, 
ideas, and traditions to the next 
generation. Native American tales 
give information about how and 
where a tribe lived, the foods they 
ate, and how they got their food.

What Makes Good Storytelling 



* 

/ 

# 



When the members of a tribe meet and sit in a trib- 
al circle, the storyteller's place is one of honor. The 
storyteller's job is to pass traditions and history, 
through stories, from one generation to the next. 



Words 

A storytellers tools are words. Geri Keams works 
with words to create moods, and to help you imag- 
ine pictures, called images, in your mind. 

During performance, liften carefully to 
fke i*dorJ$. Ho \m Jo fke^ kelp you picture tke 
ffor^ i* yo ur minJ? 



& 



ice, Face, ana 
ovement 



Storytellers use their voices, facial expressions, 
and body movements to make stories more inter- 
esting and to express the moods and feelings in 
stories. A storyteller does not memorize a story 
word-for-word. The stories can change slightly 
with each telling.

Listeners Who Are 
Partners 

Storytelling is a shared experience. It’s a partner- 
ship between the storyteller and the listener. As 
the listener, you agree to be a partner in the story- 
telling. Listening to stories is different from watch- 
ing TV or a movie. You are in the same room with 
the stoiyteller. Inappropriate talking and noise can 
distract the storyteller and disturb other audience 
members. 

Help d»er i Kea^M by li{+ening and watching 
carefully. If you are a{|ced to participate, join 
in\ Laugh if {omething i{ funny. Applaud for 
the {tor«e{ you like. Have fun and enjoy being

O A good story keeps your attention. 

© Usually, the story is short. 

© Its characters and events are interesting. 

© It has a problem, or conflict, which must be 
solved. 

O Something unexpected often happens — a 
surprise — that keeps listeners interested. 

• Many stories have a lesson, or moral, which 
teaches something about life. 



© A good story makes you think.
