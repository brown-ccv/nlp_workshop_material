ABSTRACT 

This paper summarizes the literature and research on the 
relationships between culture and mathematics. Ethnomathematics examines the 
ways that different cultural groups use mathematics. Various definitions of 
ethnomathematics are presented, along with a framework covering areas of 
mathematics and mathematics education included in the term. Summaries and 
sample writings are offered for each of these areas: the cultural nature of 
mathematics, mathematical thought in different cultures, cultural history of 
mathematics, politics of mathematics, mathematics learning in different 
cultures, situated cognition including language and bilingualism, societal 
effects of mathematics education, and relationships between ethnomathematics 
and mathematics education. In addition, research is cited on the effects of 
culture on mathematics achievement, focusing on the transmission of cultural 
influences via popular media, parents, teachers, and students* own beliefs 
and attitudes. Examples of cultural influences on mathematics achievement are 
offered for Asian American, African American, Native American, and Hispanic 
students, as well as students from some foreign cultures. A research agenda 
for culture and mathematics is outlined that is relevant to understanding how 
mathematics is situated in a rural setting. (Contains 119 references.) (SV)

Culture and Mathematics: An Overview of the Literature with a View to Rural Contexts 



Much has been written about relationships between culture and mathematics. The writings span a range of 
topics that include the cultural bases for mathematics, mathematics development in different cultures, the historical 
culture of mathematics, the effects of culture on mathematics learning and dispositions toward mathematics, and the 
political effects of mathematics and mathematics education on societies. This paper summarizes the literature and 
research by discussing major concepts, writers, and tenets; it concludes by offering a research framework for further 
study of mathematics and culture. 

Ethnomathematics 

Writings about culture and mathematics emerged in the early and late eighties around the concept of 
ethnomathematics. Ubiratan D’ Ambrosio, a Brazilian mathematician, coined the term and offered one of its earliest 
definitions: “Ethnomathematics is the way different cultural groups mathematise (count, measure, relate, classify, 
and infer)” (D’ Ambrosio, 1984). According to D’ Ambrosio, the prefix ethno describes “all of the ingredients that 
make up the cultural identity of a group — language, codes, values, jargon, beliefs, food and dress, habits, and 
physical traits.” The term mathematics describes “a broad view of mathematics which includes ciphering, arithmetic, 
classifying, ordering, inferring, and modeling” (pp. 2-3). Thus, ethnomathematics examines the ways different 
cultural groups use mathematics (D ’Ambrosio, 1984). 

At about the same time, other writers, including Paulus Gerdes of Mozambique, Marcia Ascher of the 
United States, and Alan Bishop of England, were conducting cultural research in mathematics and writing about 
ethnomathematics (Barton, 1996). Much of their work was published primarily in two international mathematics 
education journals. For the Learning of Mathematics and Educational Studies in Mathematics, with the latter 
publishing a monograph that Bishop edited. These writers laid important foundations for further writing about 
culture and mathematics and stimulated a variety of research studies. 

A Problem with Definition 

Since D’ Ambrosio coined the term ethnomathematics, writers, including D’ Ambrosio himself, have 
struggled with its meaning. A consensus was not evident in these early writings (Barton, 1996; Presmeg, 1998; Vital 



4 



1 



and Skovsmove, 1997). To illustrate, the following definitions of ethnomathematics were offered from 1984 to 
1996: 



“The mathematics which is practiced among identifiable cultural groups such as national-tribal societies, 
labour groups, children of certain age brackets, and professional classes.” (D’Ambrosio, 1985, p. 45) 

“The mathematics implicit in each practice.” (Gerdes, 1 986, p. 10) 

“The study of mathematical ideas of a non-literate culture.” (Ascher and Ascher, 1 986, cited in Barton, 
1996, p. 209) 

“The codification which allows a cultural group to describe, manage, and understand reality.” 
(D’Ambrosio, 1987, p. 3) 

“Mathematics ...is conceived as a cultural product which has developed as a result of various activities” 
(Bishop, 1988, p. 182). 

“The art of explaining, understanding and coping with the socio-cultural and natural environment... The 
dynamic of this interaction [between the individual and the environment], mediated by communication 
and the resulting codification and symbol isation, produces structured knowledge which eventually 
becomes disciplines” (D’Ambrosio, 1990, p. 22, cited in Barton, 1996, p. 208). 

“The study and presentation of mathematical ideas of traditional peoples” (Ascher, 1991, p. 188, cited in 
Presmeg, 1998, p. 328). 

“The arts or techniques developed by different cultures to explain, to understand, to cope with their 
environment” (p. 1 1 84, D’Ambrosio, 1992). 

“Any form of cultural knowledge or social activity characteristic of a social group and/or cultural group, 
that can be recognized by other groups such as ‘Western’ anthropologists, but not necessarily by the 
group of origin, as mathematical knowledge or mathematical activity” (Pompeu, 1994, p. 3, cited in 
Presmeg, 1998, p. 328). 

“The mathematics of cultural practice.” (Presmeg, 1 996, p. 3, cited in Presmeg, 1 998, p. 328). 



As Barton (1996) noted earlier, these definitions pose contrasting views of ethnomathematics — from very 

specific views like those from Ascher, Pompeu, and early D’Ambrosio to very broad views like those of Bishop, 

Gerdes, and late D’Ambrosio. The definitions also show evolution over time, especially with D’Ambrosio, Gerdes, 

and Ascher (Barton, 1 996). Vithal and Skovsmose (1997) and Barton (1 996) both noted that the definitions of 

ethnomathematics offered by D’Ambrosio and Gerdes seemed to broaden over time. 

Vithal and Skovsmose (1997), after an analysis of writings about ethnomathematics, offered a definition 

that attempts to capture the varied dimensions of the concept: 

“Ethnomathematics refers to a cluster of ideas concerning the history of mathematics, the cultural roots of 
mathematics, the implicit mathematics in everyday settings, and mathematics education” (p. 133). 



Barton (1996), after reflective analyses of the writings of D’Ambrosio, Gerdes, Ascher, and others, noted 
that discussions about ethnomathematics were about either mathematics or mathematics education. Within each 
category, he identified four areas of writing. 



Writings about Ethnomathematics 


Mathematics 


Mathematics Education 


Cultural Nature of Mathematics 


Mathematics Learning in Other Cultures 


Mathematics Thought in Other Cultures 


Situated Cognition including Language and 
Bilingualism 


Cultural History of Mathematics 


Societal Effects of Mathematics Education 


Politics of Mathematics 


Relationships between Mathematics and 
Mathematics Education 



Proceeding from this analysis, he offered an alternative definition of ethnomathematics that attempts to 
capture these categories and areas: 

“Ethnomathematics is a research programme of the way in which cultural groups understand, 
articulate and use the concepts and practices which we describe as mathematical, whether or 
not the cultural group has a concept of mathematics” (p. 214). 

According to Barton, this definition implies that “(a) ethnomathematics is not a mathematical study, it is more like 

anthropology or history; (b) the definition itself depends on who is stating it, and it is culturally specific; (c) the 

practice which it describes is also culturally specific; and (d) ethnomathematics implies some form of relativism for 

mathematics” (p. 215). Barton also provided a framework for research on culture and mathematics, which will be 

shared later in the paper. 

Culture, Mathematics, and Mathematics Education 

Using Barton’s (1996) areas of ethnomathematics as a framework, we will offer a brief summary and 
sample writings within each area. Barton identified many of these writings; we have included other and more recent 
work. 

Culture and Mathematics 

The cultural nature of mathematics. At the heart of the cultural nature of mathematics is the nature of 
mathematics itself. According to Dossey (1992), mathematicians do not agree on the nature of mathematics. One of 




ILl 



the primary issues is whether mathematics is “external” or “internal” to the person. The debate can be traced back to 
the days of Plato, an externalist, and Aristotle, an internalist (Dossey, 1992). This argument is pertinent to the 
relationship of culture and mathematics in that internalists see connections between mathematics and culture while 
externalists see mathematics as culture free. Alan Bishop (1976, 1983, 1986, 1988), one of the early writers about 
culture and mathematics, believes that mathematics is “a cultural product which has developed as a result of various 
activities.” This “cultural product” includes counting, locating, measuring, designing, playing, and explaining. 
Stigler and Baranes (1988) also view mathematics as “an assemblage of culturally constructed representations and 
procedures for manipulating these procedures” (p. 258). These viewpoints certainly suggest an internal view of the 
nature of mathematics because culture is inherent in persons. Critics of ethnomathematics, like Barrow (1992), 
Chevallard (1990), and Penrose (1989) tend to be externalists. 

Mathematical thought in other cultures. This research includes extensive anthropological work on the 
mathematical thought of different peoples throughout the world. The focus here is on the intuitive mathematics 
thinking that has developed in largely undereducated cultures. According to Barton (1994), these studies include 
work by Harris (1991) with aborigines in Australia, by Gay and Cole (1967) with the indigenous people of Liberia, 
by Pixten (1987) and Ascher (1991) with Native Americans in North America, by Kyselka (1981) with Pacific 
Islanders, Carraher (1986) with Brazilian construction foremen, and by Zaslavsky (1973) and Gerdes (1991a, 1991b, 
1991c) with tribes in Africa. Collectively, this work shows that mathematical thought is developed intuitively and in 
lieu of formal schooling. 

Cultural history of mathematics. This work attempts to identify the historical mathematical contributions 
of different cultures across the world. These writers attempt to demonstrate a cultural evolution of mathematics 
within other cultures. They also address the common belief that most worthwhile mathematics known and used 
today was developed primarily in the Western world (Europe and North America). D’Ambrosio’s (1980) review of 
the evolution of mathematics and his call for incorporating ethnomathematics into the history of mathematics 
(D’Ambrosio, 1985) provide excellent early examples of this work. Other examples include Anderson’s (1990) 
concept of world mathematics and Frankenstein’s and Powell’s (1989) attempt to redefine mathematics. According 
to Barton (1996), major works also include Gerdes (1992), Fang and Takayama (1975), Kline (1953), Swetz (1987), 
and Restivo et al(\ 993).

Politics of mathematics. This work attempts to show how mathematics has affected non-academic areas of 
society. According to Barton (1996), primary works include Bishop’s (1990) essay on the powerful influence of 
Western mathematics and D’Ambrosio’s (1990) discussion of the role of mathematics in building democratic and 
just societies. Knijnik’s (1993) research on the political and economic power of mathematics for Brazilian sugar 
cane farmers offers an interesting addition to this work. Finally, Osmond’s (2000) analysis of employers’ perceived 
value of mathematics contributes to this area. 

Culture and Mathematics Education 

Culture and mathematics education also have strong relationships. Cultural values affect teaching, 
learning and curriculum. Formal mathematics teachine. learning, and curriculum can provide a reflection of 
culture. Clearly, mathematics education can affect the political and social dynamics of a culture. 

Mathematics Learning in Other Cultures. These writings focus on the importance of using a culturally 
specific context in teaching and learning mathematics. The literature might include (a) using relevant cultural 
examples from students’ culture or (b) exposing students to a variety of cultural contexts (multicultural ism). 
Examples of the first category include Nelson-Barber and Estrin (1995) and Bradley (1984), who provide insights 
into revising mathematics teaching and curricula to capture the traditions and culture of Native Americans; Gerdes 
(1988b, 2001), who offers suggestions for using African art and games in elementary classrooms; Malloy (1997), 
who provides suggestions for improving mathematics instruction for African American students; and Flores (1997), 
who provides suggestions for instructional strategies and materials for Hispanic students. Examples of the second 
category include articles by Becker and Jacobs (1997), Thomas (1997) and Davidson and Kramer (1997) in the 1997 
NCTM Yearbook (Trentacosta and Kenney, 1997). Other examples include Zaslavsky’s (1991, 1998) suggestions 
for integrating eth nomathematics in middle school and elementary classrooms, Karp’s (1994) use of multicultural 
children’s literature for teaching mathematics, Dolinko’s (1997) use of flags in instruction, and Yao’s (1984) 
suggestions for multicultural teaching. 

Situated cognition including language and bilingualism. Research in this area focuses on culture’s 
influence in learning mathematics. In situated cognition, the mathematics that is learned is generally not the 
formalized, codified mathematics learned in school, but the intuitive mathematics needed for specific tasks. Barton 
(1996) offers several examples of this type of research: Saxe’s (1988) study of Brazilian candy vendors, Carraher’s 




5 



(1985, 1989) work with illiterate Brazilians, Lancy’s (1983) work with the Kewa of Papua New Guinea, Schribner’s 
(1984) work with dairy farmers in the United States, Lave’s (1988) study of American shoppers, and Masingila’s 
(1992) study of carpet layers provide a variety of examples of this research. The analysis of children’s different 
written and oral uses of arithmetic by Reed and Lave (1981) also fits into this category. 

Another area in this category is the effect of bilingualism on mathematics learning. Significant research and 
discussions can be found in Austin and Howson (1979), Clarkson and Galbreath (1992), Cuevas (1984), Cathcart 
(1980, 1982), and Khisty (1997). In related studies, Moore (1994) points to differences in the mathematical language 
of Native Americans and the English language of mathematics. The work of Geary et al (1996) examining the 
advantages of the Chinese language for learning early number concepts also fits in this category. 

Societal effects of mathematics education. Barton (1996) uses Gerdes’s analyses of the societal effects of 
the mathematics education reformation in Mozambique (Gerdes, 1981, 1985) as examples in this category. Vithal 
and Skovsmose (1997) provide a similar analysis of the role of mathematics education in social changes within 
South Africa. Frankenstein (1997) suggests a critical mathematics pedagogy and curriculum, based on the critical 
education theory of Frerior (1978), to help students understand how mathematics can serve as a mechanism to create 
and reveal power and oppression. The Mathematics and Society curriculum that includes the social institution of 
mathematics offered by Abraham and Bibby (1988) provides an excellent example of the writing in this area. 
Stanic’s (1989) call for the elimination of cultural discontinuity and social inequality in classrooms also addresses 
this issue directly. 

Relationships between mathematics and mathematics education. According to Barton (1996), Borba’s 
(1990), D’Ambrosio’s (1999), and Vithal’s (1992) theoretical discussions about ethnomathematics and curriculum 
fit this category. Presmeg’s (1998) strategy for bringing ethnomathematics into teacher preparation programs clearly 
fits into this category. Walker’s and McCoy’s (1997) study of the relationships between African Americans’ 
perception of mathematics and their motivation to learn mathematics is a recent example of this work. 

Effects of Culture on Mathematics Achievement 

Over the past twenty years, researchers in mathematics education have sought to understand how cultural 
differences affect students’ performance in mathematics and their dispositions toward the subject. The research 
methodologies for these studies have been generally comparative; researchers attempted to identify cultural factors 



6 



9 




that might explain differences in mathematics achievement and attitudes. These studies investigated cultural 
differences across three general groups: (a) students from different countries (usually Asian nations and the United 
States); (b) students from different racial or ethnic groups (Asian American, African Americans, Native Americans, 
Hispanic American, and Caucasian Americans); and (c) males and females. This body of research has revealed four 
general cultural factors that seem to affect mathematics performance and dispositions: (a) parent attitudes, values, 
and beliefs; (b) teacher attitudes, values, and beliefs; (c) student perceptions and beliefs; and (d) language. These 
factors will serve as the organizing structure to review the research in the area. 

Influence of the Popular Media 

Leder (1992) suggests that societal influences on beliefs about gender differences in mathematics can be 
assessed through an analysis of media. She comments, “The important role played by the media in shaping ideas and 
attitudes, as well as reflecting and reinforcing popular beliefs, is widely recognized” (p. 612). She reports that Jacobs 
and Eccles (1985) found parents* beliefs about gender differences in mathematics could be shaped by the media. In 
an analysis of media reports, she found that the media promoted a stereotypical view of male roles in mathematical 
careers and tasks (Leder, 1984, 1986). Similarly, Malloy (1997) suggested that the media’s emphasis on 
achievement gaps leads to stereotyping among African American parents, teachers, and students about students* 
ability to do mathematics. 

Influence of Parents 

Across all types of comparative studies — international, race/ethnic, and gender — parent expectations 
have strong effects on student performance and attitudes. As Leder (1992) has reported, Armstrong and Price (1982) 
and Lantz and Smith (1981) found that students* attitudes and aspirations toward mathematics were linked to their 
parents* educational goals with regard to school mathematics. In comparing Chinese and American parents, 
Stevenson (1987) noted that Asian parents generally believed that any child is capable of learning, but American 
parents placed more emphasis on innate ability. He also noted that American parents believed reading to be more 
important than mathematics, while Asian parents believe that mathematics and reading were equally important. In 
addition, a large body of research indicated that Asian parents emphasized effort as the key to success in school 



7 



X 



more than parents from other ethnic or racial groups (Holloway, 1988; Mizokawa & Ryckman, 1990; Hess, Chang, 
and McDevitt (1987); Lee, Ichikawa and Stevenson, 1987; Tuss, Zimmer, and Ho, 1995). 

Studies comparing Asian American students with Caucasian American students identified similar parental 
effects, although enculturation in the United States seemed to have lessened the cultural effects slightly. Chen and 
Stevenson (1995) found that parents of Asian American students held higher standards of achievement, believed 
effort was critical to success, and had more positive attitudes about achievement and studying diligently than their 
Caucasian American counterparts. Sue and Okazaki (1990) found that Asian American parents were more likely to 
insist on unquestioned obedience. Kao (1995) found that Asian American parents invested more in educational 
resources than their American counterparts. Hutsinger and Jose (1995) explored relationships among mothers, 
fathers, and daughters in Chinese American and Caucasian American families as they solved spatial tasks together. 
They also found that Chinese Americans were more respectful, more serious, and more orderly, and Caucasian 
Americans were more sociable, more talkative, and used more humor in solving the tasks. Furthermore, Chinese 
American parents talked less to themselves and more to their daughters, whereas Caucasian American parents talked 
more to each other. 

In comparing parents of African American, Caucasian American, Hispanic American, and Asian American 
students, researchers have noted that mothers in all groups had equally high expectations for their children 
(Alexander and Entwisle, 1988; Stevenson, Chen, & Uttal, 1990; Galper, Wigfield, & Seefeldt, 1997). African 
American parents, however, reflected ambivalent and often contradictory values about education to their children 
(Alsalam, 1991). Hispanic American parents were less confident that their children would get a good education or 
job after formal schooling (Galper et al., 1997). 

As noted by Nelson-Barber and Estrin (1995), the parenting practices of Native American students tended 
to contradict traditional schooling practices. Traditional tribal learning emphasizes “watch-then do” or “listen-then 
do” rather than “trial and error,” which is often emphasized in schools (Swisher and Deyhle, 1989). Brod (1976) also 
noted the high mobility of Native American families and their limited access to schools as factors in poor 
mathematics performance. 



Influence of Teachers 

Higher expectations of student performance is clearly reflected in the differences between middle school 
mathematics curricula in China and in the United States (Zhonghong and Eggleton, 1995). Mathematics curricula in 
the United States revealed low expectations for performance, while Chinese mathematics curricula challenged its 
students. Stigler and Hiebert (1999) also found different teaching routines among Japanese, German, and American 
teachers. They noted that Japanese teachers challenged students more, introduced more advanced content, and spent 
more time analyzing and preparing lessons than their German and American counterparts. For Hispanic students, 
Valverde (1984) noted that school curricula did not reflect the intrinsic, cultural learning of Hispanic students and 




8 



11 



that teachers were not prepared to address the cultural differences of Hispanic Americans. Bradley (1984) observed 
that many Native American students had extensive knowledge of mathematics deeply rooted in their culture and 
traditions; however, few teachers tapped into this reservoir of traditional knowledge (Kawagley, 1 990; Pomeroy, 
1988). 

Leder (1992), in an analysis of research on teacher interactions with male and female students in 
mathematics classrooms, noted some subtle differences in the interactions. She noted that, in general, males received 
more criticism and praise, were monitored more frequently, and had more contacts with teachers. She also noted 
studies that suggested teachers generally supported the notion that mathematics is a male domain (Fennema, 1 990; 
Leder, 1986). In general, she concluded that the cumulative effects of these interactions and beliefs could have 
substantial impact on the ways females view their potential in mathematics. 

Influence of Students’ Own Beliefs and Attitudes 

Students* beliefs and attitudes can be viewed as a product of their cultural heritage and, to a large extent, an 
extension of parental beliefs and attitudes. It is not surprising, then, that research reveals similar differences across 
types of students. Despite poorer performance on most measures of mathematics achievement, American children 
were more optimistic about their performance and future in mathematics (Stevenson, 1987) and Hispanic students 
had high aspirations for rewarding careers than Asian students (Anderson and Johnson, 1971 ; Espinoza, Fernandez, 
and Dombusch, 1977; Juarez and Kuvlesky, 1968). Ramirez and Castaneda (1974) found that Hispanic American 
students tend to be more field dependent than Caucasian American students. Similarly, Malloy (1997, p. 24) 
concluded, “African American students generally learn in ways characterized by social and affective emphases, 
harmony with the community, holistic perspectives, field dependence, expressive creativity, and non-verbal 
communication** (see also Stiff, 1990; Willis, 1992). Malloy (1997) also suggested that school knowledge and 
cultural knowledge of African Americans sometimes oppose each other. Therefore, African Americans often did not 
value school knowledge. Through interviews of African American high school students. Walker and McCoy (1997) 
found that students* perceptions of mathematics were related to familiar surroundings in home, school, and 
community and that their motivation to learn mathematics was diminished by a variety of factors, such as lack of 
teacher support and relevance, as well as increased involvement in extracurricular activities.

Influence of Language 



Language also seems to affect mathematics performance. For example, Geary and colleagues (1997) found 
that the language structure of Asian number names assisted Chinese children in developing meaningful early number 
concepts. Valverde (1984) noted that differences in English and Spanish contributed to Hispanic Americans’ poor 
performance and involvement in mathematics. Moore (1994) noted that Native American language did not align 
well with traditional mathematics vocabulary and terms, thereby causing learning problems for Native American 
students. 

A Research Agenda for Culture and Mathematics 

In keeping with his definition of ethnomathematics as a research program. Barton (1996) outlined a scheme 
for classifying, analyzing, designing, and reviewing research that focuses on relationships between culture and 
mathematics. Besides establishing a system for classifying studies of ethnomathematics^ Barton’s scheme also is 
extremely useful in our attempt to understand how mathematics is situated in a rural setting. 

Barton classifies research in ethnomathematics in three dimensions: time, culture, and mathematics. “On 
the time dimension, ethnomathematics may be concerned with conceptions of an ancient or a contemporary cultural 
group” (p. 220). It also may be concerned with historical or contemporary practices of a cultural group. Examples 
might include research on how early Appalachian settlers used mathematics or on modern-day Appalachian 
entrepreneurs’ use of mathematics. “The cultural dimension of the definition extends from a distinct ethnic group, 
to a purely social or vocational group” (p.20). Research on this dimension may focus on African Americans in 
Appalachia, male teens in Appalachia, or teachers in Appalachia. “The mathematical dimension of 
ethnomathematics is determined by the relationship of the mathematical ideas to mathematics itself, i.e., 
ethnomathematics is a study which may be internal to mathematics, or conceptually removed from existing 
mathematical conventions.” (p. 220). Examples of this dimension might include the varied formal conceptions of 
mathematics held by Appalachian teachers or the mathematics used by craftsman in Appalachia. The graph in Figure 
1 (taken from Barton) below describes how these three dimensions might interact.
