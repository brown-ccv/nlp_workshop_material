Criticism 


One of the most prestigious and selective Romanian 
publishing house Eminescu in the Library of Philosophy 
published in autumn 2009 its entire sapiantial works 
including all volumes of aphorisms published before and 
other volumes that have not seen the light to that date, in 
Romanian language. Romanian academician Gheorghe 
Vladutescu,University Professor, D.Phil. philosopher, one 
of the biggest romanian celebrity in the philosophy of 
culture and humanism believes about sapiential works of 
Sorin Cerin in Wisdom Collection:" Sapiential literature 
has a history perhaps as old writing itself. Not only in the 
Middle Ancient, but in ancient Greece "wise men" were 
chosen as apoftegmatic (sententiar) constitute, easily 
memorable, to do, which is traditionally called the ancient 
Greeks, Paideia, education of the soul for one's 
training. And in Romanian culture is rich tradition.Mr. Sorin 
Cerin is part of it doing a remarkable work of all. Quotes - 
focuses his reflections of life and cultural experience and 
its overflow the shares of others. All those who will open 
this book of teaching, like any good book, it will reward

them by participation in wisdom, good thought of reading 
them. "This consideration about cerinian sapiential works 
appeared in: Literary Destiny from Canada pages 26 si 27, 
nr. 8, December 2009,Oglinda literard (Literary Mirror) 
nr. 97, January 2010, page 5296 and Zona 
interzisa(Forbidden Zone)" Publications Nordlitera and 
Zona interzisa (The Forbidden Zone) recorded first in 
developing this collection of wisdom:" The Bucharest 
prestigious publishing house recently released book 
entitled: Collection of Wisdom by Sorin Cerin. Find it on 
the cover of the following:" It is a reference edition of the 
cerinian sapiential work. 7012 totaling aphorisms. Appear 
for the first time works of aphorisms: Wisdom, Passion, 
Illusion and reality and revised editions: Revelations 
December 21, 2012, Immortality and Learn to die." 
Reviews and events in the press, Romanian Chronicle :- 
More than a "Wisdom collection" Altermedia Romania - 
Wisdom collection by Sorin Cerin. 

One of the most reprezentative romanian literary critic, Ion 
Dodu Balan , University Professor, D.Lit. considered that 
Sorin Cerin " Modern poet and prosiest, essays and 
philosophic study's author on daring and ambitious themes 
like immortality, ephemerid and eternity, on death, naught, 
life, faith, spleen. Sorin Cerin has lately approached similar 
fundamental themes, in the genre of aphorisms, in the 
volumes: Revelations December 21, 2012, and Immortality. 
Creations that, through the language of literary theory, are 
part of the sapient creation, containing aphorisms, proverbs, 
maxims etc. which „sont les echos de l'experience", that 
makes you wonder how such a young author can have such 
a vast and varied life experience, transfigured with talent in 
hundreds of copies on genre of wisdom.As to fairly 
appreciate the sapient literature in this two volumes of 
Sorin Cerin, I find it necessary to specify, at all 
pedantically and tutoring, that the sapient creation aphorism 


9 


SORIN CERIN - WISDOM COLLECTION 
Complete Works of Aphorisms -Reference Edition 


is related if not perfectly synonymous, in certain cases to 
the proverb, maxim, thinking, words with hidden meaning, 
as they are ... in the Romanian Language and Literature. 
Standing in front of such a creation, we owe it to establish 
some hues, to give the genre her place in history. The so- 
called sapient genre knows a long tradition in the universal 
literature, since Homer up to Marc Aurelius , 
Rochefoucauld , Baltasar Gracian , Schopenhauer and many 
others, while in Romanian literature since the chroniclers of 
the XVII and XVIII century, to Anton Pann , C. Negruzzi , 
Eminescu , Iprga, Ibraileanu , L.Blaga , and G.Calinescu up 
to C.V. Tudor in the present times. The great critic and 
literary historical, Eugen Lovinescu, once expressed his 
opinion and underlined "the sapient aphoristic character", 
as one of the characteristics that creates the originality of 
Romanian literature, finding its explanation in the nature of 
the Romanian people, as lovers of peerless proverbs.Even if 
he has lived a time abroad, Sorin Cerin has carried, as he 
tells us through his aphorisms, his home country in his 
heart, as the illustrious poet Octavian Goga said, „ 
wherever we go we are home because in the end all roads 
meet inside us". In Sorin Cerin' s aphorisms, we discover his 
own experience of a fragile soul and a lucid mind, but also 
the Weltanschauung of his people, expressed through a 
concentrated and dense form.Philosophical, social, 
psychological and moral observations. Sorin Cerin is a 
"moralist" with a contemporary thinking and sensibility. 
Some of his aphorisms, which are concentrated just like 
energy in an atom, are real poems in one single verse. 
Many of his gnomic formulations are the expression of an 
ever-searching mind, of a penetrating, equilibrated way of 
thinking, based on the pertinent observation of the human 
being and of life, but also of rich bookish information.Hus, 
he dears to define immortality as "moment's eternity" and 
admits to "destiny's freedom to admit his own death facing 
eternity", "God's moment of eternity which mirrors for 


10 


SORIN CERIN - WISDOM COLLECTION 
Complete Works of Aphorisms -Reference Edition 


eternity in Knowledge, thus becoming transient, thus 
Destiny which is the mirror imagine of 
immortality". "Immortality is desolated only for those who 
do not love", "immortality is the being's play of light with 
Destiny, so both of them understand the importance of 
love".Nevertheless, the gnomic, sapient literature is 
difficult to achieve, but Sorin Cerin has the resources to 
accomplish for the highest exigency. He has proved it in his 
ability to correlate The Absolute with Truth, Hope, Faith, 
Sin, Falsehood, Illusion, Vanity, Destiny, The Absurd, 
Happiness, etc.A good example of logic correlation of such 
notions and attributes of The Being and Existence, is 
offered by the Spleen aphorisms from the Revelations 
December 21, 2012 volume. Rich and varied in expression 
and content, the definitions, valued judgments on one of the 
most characteristics state of the Romanian soul, The 
Spleen, a notion hard to translate, as it is different from the 
Portuguese "saudode", the Spanish "soledad", the German 
"zeenzug", the French "melancolie" and even the English 
"spleen". Naturally, there is room for improving regarding 
this aspect, but what has been achieved until now is very 
good. Here are some examples which can be presumed to 
be „pars pro toto" for both of his books: „Through spleen 
we will always be slapped by the waves of Destiny which 
desire to separate immortality from the eternity of our tear", 
„The spleen, is the one that throws aside an entire eternity 
for your eyes to be borne one day", „The spleen is love's 
freedom", „The spleen is the fire that burns life as to 
prepare it for death". (Fragments of the review published in 
the Literary Mirror (Oglinda Literara) no. 88, Napoca News 
March 26, 2009, Romanian North Star (Luceafarul 
Romanaesc), April 2009, and Literary Destinies (Destine 
Literare), Canada, April 2009)) Adrian Dinu Rachieru , 
University Professor, D.Lit. states:". ..we may , of course, 
mention worth quoting, even memorable wordings. For 
example, Life is the "epos of the soal", future is defined as

" the father of death". Finally, after leaving "the world of 
dust", we are entering the virtual space, into the "eternity of 
the moment"(which was given to us)(Fragments of the 
review published in the Literary Mirror (Oglinda Literara) 
no. 89 and the Romanian North Star (Luceafarul 
Romanesc), May 2009. . Ion Pachia Tatomirescu ,University 
Professor, D.Lit states: "a volume of aphorisms, Revelations 
- December 21, 2012, mainly paradoxes, saving themselves 
through a "rainbow" of thirty six "theme colors" - his own 
rainbow - as a flag dangling in the sky, in the sight of the 
Being ( taking into account Platon's acceptation on the 
collocation, from Phaedrus, 248-b), or from Her glimpsing 
edge, for the author, at the same time poet, novelist and 
sophist, "the father of coaxialism", lirosoph, as VI. Streinu 
would have named him (during the period of researching 
Lucian Blaga's works), knows how to exercise thereupon 
catharsis on the horizon arch of the metaphorical 
knowledge from the complementarily of the old, eternal 
Field of Truth " or of the sixth cover of the Revelation... 
volume, written by Sorin Cerin, we take notice of 
fundamental presentation signed by the poet and literary 
critic Al. Florin Tene: «Sorin Cerin's reflection are 
thinkings, aphorisms or apothegms, ordered by theme and 
alphabetically, having philosophical essence, on which the 
writer leans on like on a balcony placed above the world to 
see the immediate, through the field glass turned to himself, 
and with the help of wisdom to discover the vocation of 
distance. This book's author's meditation embraces 
reflections that open the way towards the philosophy's 
deeps, expressed through a precis and beautiful style, which 
is unseparated from perfection and the power of 
interpreting the thought that he expresses. As a wise man 
once said, Philosophy exists where an object is neither a 
thing, nor an event, but an idea. ».The paradox condensing 
of Sorin Cerin's aphorisms in a "rainbow" of thirty six 
"theme colors"- as I said above - tried to give the "sacred

Life? Would it be a world without diversity because only

Unique and Random through His love for the

from what it represents, that is chaos and primordial 
instinct, thus the Everything's Being but also of the 
Everything behind Everything.
