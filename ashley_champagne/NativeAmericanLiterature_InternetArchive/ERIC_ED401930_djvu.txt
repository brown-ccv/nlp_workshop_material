ABSTRACT 

fiction about Native Americans written for grades K~6 was analyzed to 
determine the amount of cultural diversity as measured by cultural 
area, time frame, and physical setting of the story. All analyzed 
works were published in the United States or Canada. Data identifying 
publisher type, mainline or alternative, and the ethnic background of 
writers and illustrators were also collected to determine if these 
factors affect the content of the literature. Works were assessed 
according to ten culture areas, four time frames, and three settings. 
The literature portrays Native Americans as contemporary culturally 
diverse peoples. Results from the study include: (1) most works were 
written about Native Americans of the Northeast, Southwest, or Plains 
culture areas; (2) most works have a contemporary time frame and a 
rural setting; (3) only 10°/o of works were about buffalo hunting 
Plains Indians in the ethnographic preseht even though they comprised 
the most popular combination of culture area, time frame, and setting 
combination; (4) the majority of works were published by mainline 
publishers, and only 9% were produced by alternative publishers; and 
(5) 76°/o of the works were written and 69% were illustrated by 
non-Native Americans. (Contains 41 references.) (Author/SWC)

Abstract 



Two hundred eighty one works of in-print children's fiction 
about Native Americans written for grades K-6 were examined by 
content analysis to determine the amount of cultural diversity as 
measured by culture area, timeframe, and physical setting. Data 
identifying publisher type, mainline or alternative, and the ethnic 
background of writers and illustrators were collected. Most works 
were written about Native Americans of the Northeast, Southwest, 
and Plains culture areas. Most works had a contemporary timeframe 
and a rural setting. Only 10% of works were about buffalo hunting 
Plains Indians. Most works were published by mainline publishers 
and were written and illustrated by non— Native people.

Introduction 



The United States of America is a culturally diverse nation 
whose population consists of Native Americans (Indians, Aleuts, 
and Eskimos), descendants of immigrants, and recent immigrants. 
Contemporary American society is characterized by cultural 
pluralism (members retain their own language and customs) rather 
than following the earlier "melting pot" (everyone blends in) 
pattern. Four distinct minority (people of color) groups in the 
United States today are African Americans, Asian Americans, 
Hispanic Americans and Native Americans. Children from these four 
growing groups will make up one third of the school-age 
population by the year 2000 (Chavkin 1990). 

Historically, children's books about people of color were 
few in number and characterized by stereotypical (without variety 
or individuality) portrayals presenting inaccurate and harmful 
images (Cooperative Children's Book Center 1991). In 1965, Nancy 
Larrick's eye-opening article about the dearth of multicultural 
children's literature, "The All-White World of Children's Books" 
(Saturday Review 1965) evoked strong responses in the publishing 
and book-buying world. Since the 1960s, parents, educators, 
librarians and others concerned with what children read have 
striven to improve the number and quality of multicultural 
children's books and to promote works by people of color. 
Alternative publishers, usually small, independently owned and 
operated publishers, also play an important role in supporting

minority authors and perspectives. 

Literature about one's own people in various settings, 
situations and contexts provides self-awareness, promotes self 
esteem, contributes to interest in reading, and greater 
achievement in school (Myers 1989). Multicultural books celebrate 
the contributions of past generations and provide positive adult 
role models for minority children. Children of the dominant 
Eurocentric (Caucasian) culture benefit from an increased 
understanding and respect for others. 

Native Americans, one of four minority groups, trace their 
ancestry to the original human inhabitants of the North American 
continent. Currently, they number approximately 2 million and 
claim membership in over 300 Federally recognized tribal nations 
(U. S. Census Bureau 1990). Since colonial times, Native 
Americans appear in published works of American history and 
literature and provide inspiration and characters for popular 
fiction. Beverly Slapin (1992), Doris Seale (1992) and Mary 
Gloyne Byler (1974, 1992) observed that Native American 
children's literature (stories about Native American people) 
differs from literature of other minority groups in two respects, 
the popularity of Native Americans as subjects and authorship of 

most books by non— Native Americans. 

Today, a need exists for an investigation which would 
provide data about the present state, the content, and the 
production of Native American children's fiction. Specifically, 
does Native American children's fiction contain cultural 




3 



diversity? Cultural diversity is defined as variety of lifeways 
exhibited by various people at different times and places. 
Fiction, for purposes of this study, is defined as a literary 
work whose content is produced by the imagination and is not 
necessarily based on fact. In terms of production, an assessment 
of the amount of actual Native American authorship and the 
present contribution of alternative publishers to Native American 
children's literature would help to determine if the earlier 
weaknesses identified in the literature have been rectified. 

Literature Review 

Native Americans, unlike other minority people in the United 
States, currently benefit from a large selection of books about 
their people. However, the way in which Native Americans are 
portrayed in these books as well as who writes the books continue 
to be issues of grave concern. Kuipers (1991) has summarized the 
major issues in the study of Native American children's 
literature and has discussed the viewpoints of critics in the 
field. These issues include the inaccuracies and stereotypes 
exhibited in the work and the pervasiveness of non-Native authors 
and publishers in the literature. 

Each Native American, past and present, belongs to one of 
over 300 distinct but changing culture groups. Diversity exists 
among individuals, among cultures, at different times, and in 
various places. Mary Jo Lass— Woodfin (1978, 4) explains Native 
American diversity this way: 

To be Navajo is not to be Nez Perce is not to be Creek.

To live in Canyon de Chelly in 1865 is not to live in Canyon 

de Chelly in 1935 is not to live in Canyon de Chelly in 1985. 

Two Shoshone Indians living in Fort Washakie, Wyoming, in 

1965 will have two different experiences to report. 

Generally, the literature from mainline publishers is 
produced for and read by a Caucasian American child who 
visualizes Native Americans as early inhabitants of the country 
who participate in a daily round of horseback riding, buffalo 
hunting, and tepee living while wearing buckskins and a feather 
headdress (Stensland 1979). John Ewers (1982) attributes this 
image to many factors including early Spanish travels on the 
Plains, the paintings of George Catlin and Karl Bodmer, the 
Plains Indian Wars, and the Wild West Show. Authors, Stensland 
(1979) and Dorris (1992) for example, generally agree that this 
Plains Indian image prevails in mind and print. Caldwell-Wood and 
Mitten (1992) note that the image is commonly held by all 
Americans of all races, even Native American children. 

Evidence exists that contradicts the pervasiveness of the 
Plains Indian stereotype in the literature. For example, the 
Pueblo-dwelling Indians of the Southwest avoided the Plains 
Indian stereotype (Stensland 1979). Also, the most prominent 
group portrayed in children's fiction since the 1930s is Navajo 
(Lass-Woodf in 1978). However, the latter case may result from the 
work of a few individuals. Lass— Woodfin (1978) also mentions that 
the Dakota (Sioux), Iroquois, Cherokee, and Pueblo Indians are 
popular subjects. If the Plains Indian stereotype pervades the 
literature, one would expect the Dakota (Sioux) and other Plains 
Indians as a group to be most popular. 




5 



Mary Gloyne Byler (1992) notes that the past serves as the 
backdrop for most Native American children's fiction and may give 
the impression that Native Americans are extinct. Lass-Woodfin 
(1978) agrees. This impression is exacerbated by the American 
public school system which drops Native Americans from the 
history curriculum after the settling of the west (Caldwell-Wood 
and Mitten 1992). Horning (1993) observes that mainline 
publishers with national markets rarely publish books about 
contemporary Native Americans. Books with contemporary settings 
tend to be theme-oriented rather than culture based (Lass-Woodfin 
1978) and published by alternative publishers (Horning 1993). 

A different way of looking at cultural diversity in the 
literature, one that has the potential to provide a more accurate 
assessment, is the culture area concept used by American 
anthropologists. The culture area concept serves as the basis for 
museum classification of Native American artifacts. It also 
provides the structure for the definitive reference work about 
Native American peoples. Handbook of North American Indians . The 
Encyclopedia of Anthropology (1976, 104) defines culture area as 
"a part of the world in which the inhabitants share most of the 
elements of culture, such as related languages, similar 
ecological conditions, economic systems, social systems, and 
ideological systems." A. L. Kroeber (1939, 2), a pioneer in the 
formulation and use of the culture area concept, emphasizes that 
culture content is the primary consideration within geographical 
areas. Today, culture area serves as a classification device by 




6 



dividing the North American continent north of Mexico into ten 
distinct areas: Arctic, Subarctic, Northwest Coast, California, 
Southwest, Great Basin, Plateau, Plains, Southeast, and 
Northeast. Classification by culture area gives recognition to 
cultural diversity, but also recognizes basic similarities among 
distinct groups within each area. For example, the Plains groups 
would be similar in traits such as buffalo hunting but would 
differ from the farmers of the Northeast. Within this same Plains 
culture area, although groups share buffalo hunting they differ 
in other traits such as hair decoration or beadwork design. 

Culture area classification can serve as a useful tool for 
examining the cultural diversity in Native American children's 
literature in two ways. In works in which no tribal name is 
given, a culture area can be determined from examining the 
contents. For example, a story about a nomadic horse riding 
buffalo hunting group living in tepees would be placed in the 
Plains culture area. In this case, the Plains designation is more 
precise than saying that the work is about Native Americans. A 
second use for culture area classification is as a gathering 
device. Distinct tribal groups within any culture area can be 
grouped under the appropriate culture area name such as Plains. 
For example, works about the Dakota (Sioux), Cheyenne, Pawnee and 
other Plains Indian tribes can be gathered under the Plains 
label. By doing so, the question of the pervasiveness of Plains 
groups in the literature can be addressed. 

Cultural diversity in Native American children's fiction can 



ERIC 




7 



be studied through content analysis, a type of descriptive 
research. Content analysis as used in this study is defined by 
Allen and Reser (1990, 253) as "a research method employing 
rigorous and quantitative analysis of input materials in order to 
draw conclusions about their content." Busha and Harter (1980) 
list several steps in the content analysis method. These include 
formulating the research problem, defining relevant questions and 
categories of data necessary to answer these questions, 
identifying and selecting materials for analysis, the analyzing 
and placing of the data in categories, quantifying and organizing 
the data, comparing analysis of the data, and interpreting the 
data in terms of the questions asked. Doris Cruger Dale (1989, 

45) in her article about content analysis as a research 
methodology for school library materials, describes content 
analysis as "particularly valuable for investigating textbooks 
and children's literature". 

Aside from the question of cultural diversity within the 
literature, the other big issue in Native American children's 
literature concerns the ethnicity of the author and is 
characterized by contrasting viewpoints. Most children's fiction 
about Native Americans was and is written by persons who are not 
of Native American ancestry (Seale 1992, siapin 1992, Byler 1974, 
1992). Mary Gloyne Byler (1992), one of the harshest critics of 
non-Native American writers, believes that non-Native writers and 
illustrators should withdraw from the field and leave it for 
capable Native Americans, she states 




8 



Non-Indian writers have created an image of American 
Indians that is almost sheer fantasy .... This fantasy 
does not take into account the rich diversity of cultures 
that did, and do exist (1992, 95). 

Maria simson (1991) noted that thousands of Native Americans have 

attended college in the past twenty years and have the 

educational background needed for writing. Beverly Seale (1992) 

doubts that many non-Native Americans will seek the knowledge 

necessary to produce meaningful books about Native Americans . 

Caldwell-Wood and Mitten (1992) in "'I' is Not for Indian" show 

that a good book in literary terms with well-developed 

characters, exciting plot, and by a well-established author can 

be a bad book in terms of accuracy and stereotypic presentation 

of Native Americans. The Indian in the Cupboard by Lynn Reid 

Banks is used as an example. In The Indian in the Cupboard , an 

Iroguois warrior is treated as a toy. He is dressed like a Plains 

Indian and "speaks in subhuman grunts and partial sentences" 

(Caldwell-Wood and Mitten 1992, 27). 

Other writers hold a contrasting viewpoint about non-Native 

American authorship. Laura Herbst, writing in 1975, critigues 

several books by non-Native American authors including Little 

House on the Prairie by Laura Ingalls Wilder. Herbst found that 

books written in past, when cultural pluralism was not popular, 

are filled with stereotypes originating from the time of Native 

American-non-Native American conflict and show a lack of respect 

for Indian culture(s). However, Herbst, when she looked at more 

recent Native American children's fiction, concluded that the 

situation had changed. Native Americans were treated as 




9 



culturally diverse individuals and groups. Interestingly, some of 
these newer books were written by some of the same authors whose 
works Herbst unfavorably critiqued. Anna Lee Stensland (1979) 
noted/that some good non-Native American writers, including Hal 
Borland and Rudy Wiebe, are recognized by Native Americans as 
such. Hirschf elder (1973) noted that works by Native Americans 
contain the same problems as those by non— Native Americans but 
states that Native Americans should be allowed to speak for 
themselves . 

Mainline publishers publish books written mostly by non- 
Native Americans and these publishers produce most of the 
literature. Horning (1993, 12) states that works illustrated or 
written by Native Americans are "nearly impossible to find" in 
mainline publishers' catalogs. Publishers have responded to an 
increased interest in Native Americans brought about by the 
Columbus quincentennial and the movie Dances With Wolves (simson 
1991). Naomi Caldwell— Wood (1993) describes the current state of 
mainstream offerings as plentiful but unauthentic. Arlene 
Hirschf elder (1993) detects an overall improvement of quality 
regardless of the ethnic background of the writer or the type of 
publisher. 

Though some firms. Scholastic for example, try to recruit 
Native American writers and illustrators (Yeh 1991), most Native 
American authors publish through alternative publishers. Indeed, 
some tribes publish their own books. Small publishers provide a 
forum for perspectives not usually found in the trade literature. 




10 



Goley (1992) notes that special efforts need to be made to 
acquire works from alternative publishers. Sources such as 
Cooperative Children's Book Center and Through Indian Eves 
provide bibliographies and furnish publisher addresses. 

In summary, persons knowledgeable about Native American 
literature for children agree on the character of the available 
literature. Cultural diversity and individual differences among 
Native American peoples, past or present, are masked in many 
works, stories taking place in the past with a rural setting 
dominate the literature. Most works are written by non-Native 
Americans and are published by mainstream publishers. There is 
disagreement as to whether non-Native Americans should write 
books about Native Americans and if they can write good books 
about Native Americans. Statements, though agreed upon, usually 
appear to be based solely on selected items which are presented 
by the writer as representative of the whole rather than examples 
of systematic investigation. 

A search for literature relevant to this study revealed no 
systematic studies examining these variables singularly or in 
combination in in-print materials or otherwise. The issue of 
Native American writers and alternative publishers is covered but 
no studies utilizing hard data linking the two could be found. A 
study which uses a different perspective, measures cultural 
diversity, setting, and time frame as well as the production 
variables of authorship and publisher type will provide added 
data for this important subject.

Research objective 

The objective of this study is to examine the diversity in 
culture, authorship, and publisher type present in children's 
fiction about Native Americans currently in-print and published 
in the United States and Canada. The objective was met by 
examining the following questions: 

1. Based on in-print materials, who currently writes and 
publishes Native American children's fiction? 

Specifically, how many works of in-print Native American 
children's fiction come from alternative publishers? 

How many of these authors claim Native American ancestry? 

Is there a relationship between ethnicity of the author and 
type of publisher which produces that author's work? 

Who illustrates fictional books about Native Americans 
written for children? 

Is there a relationship between the ethnic heritage of 
illustrator and the type of publisher that produces the 
work? 

2. Are all culture areas, time frames, and physical settings 
represented? 

Specifically, are works concentrated in a few culture areas 
or distributed evenly? 

Does one time frame dominate the literature? 

Do alternative publishers publish the most works with a 
contemporary time frame? 

Are both rural and urban settings represented? If so, to 




12 



what extent? 

Based on data about culture area, physical setting and time, 
how much cultural diversity is present in Native American 
children's fiction currently in— print? 

Are some combinations of culture area, physical setting 
and time found more frequently than others? 

3. Do mainline and alternative publishers tend to specialize 
in works about specific culture areas, physical settings, or 
time frames? 



Methodology 

The research method used was a content analysis of 
children's fiction about Native Americans. Topics investigated 
included the culture area represented by the work, the setting 
(where the story took place), and the time frame. 

Background information about authorship and publication was 
obtained from a number of sources including the item itself, 
other books by the author, author biographies, reviews, the 
publisher, and standard reference sources. 

The books analyzed in this study were limited to fiction 
works currently in-print and written about Native American people 
for children in grades K-6. The limitation to in-print works both 
P®^®^ the number of possible works and focused on works that one 
could reasonably expect to be available for purchase. Since 
traditional Native American legends and myths are instructional 
rather than being about Native Americans and are often classed as 
nonfiction, they and contemporary stories of legends and myths 




18 



13 



were excluded from the study. 

Procedure . Works for study were compiled from publishers' 
catalogs, booklists, recommended lists, subject bibliographies, 
journal articles, and reviews in journals. Publishers mentioned 
in these sources as a possible source of Native American fiction 
for children were contacted. Population size was expected to be 
less than 100 works because of the size of the bibliographies 
similarly limited to in-print works such as de Usabel and Roeber 
(1992) with 166 works and Blank (1981) with 178 works. Both de 
Usabel and Roeber (1992) and Blank (1981) bibliographies 
contained nonfiction and myths and legends in addition to 
fiction. Print status for each work was verified in Children ' s 
Books In Pript 1995, publishers' catalogs, in Literary Market 
Place 1995, or by consulting the publisher. Non-verif iable items 
were dropped from the study. Copies of books in-print were 
gathered from local libraries and through interlibrary loan 
beginning June 15, 1995. All phases of the study were going on 
simultaneously as new works were added to the list and books 
became available for viewing. Any works identified or copies of 
books available after the designated completion date, September 
1,1995, were dropped from the study. 

Dat a Gathering Instrument . An Information sheet (Appendix A) was 
developed specifically for this study. It was printed on 5 1/2 
inch by 8 inch card stock, for ease of handling. Both standard 
bibliographic data and content analysis information were recorded 
on these cards . 




14 



Bibli°9 ra Phic data of greatest significance to this study 
were the publisher, the writer and illustrator. Title of the work 
as well as place and year of publication were also noted. 
Publisher status was based on whether the publisher was included 

in Children ' s — Books In Print . Alternate Press Publishers of 

Chijdren's Books; A Directory , or as an alternative or small 
press in Literary Market Place 1995 . Publishers appearing in 
Children 's Books In Print were designated as mainline and those 
of the last two, alternative. Those appearing in both mainline 
and alternative lists or available from both mainline and 
alternative publishers were designated as 'mixed'. If sufficient 
information was unavailable, the publisher was rated as 
' unknown ' . 

Each writer and illustrator was designated as Native 
American or non— Native American based on any available 
biographical material. If necessary, references sources such as 

Something Abogt — the Author and Contemporary Authors were used. A 

Native American, for the purposes of this study, was defined as a 
person of Indian, Aleutian or Eskimo descent. If a writer or 
illustrator claimed Native American status, it was assigned. If 
the ethnic status of the writer or illustrator could not be 
determined, it was marked as 'unknown'. Writers and illustrators 
were classed separately for each work. Works which had more than 
one writer or more than one illustrator were classed according to 
assigned status of all writers or all illustrators of that work. 

If the background of one of the multiple authors or illustrators 




15 



could not be determined, they were classed as mixed. 

Information was collected from each work by content 
analysis. Data included culture area information, setting, and 
time frame. Each work was assigned to one of ten culture areas as 
defined by the map Indians of North America (1979) and its 
companion volume The Wo rld of the American Indian (1979). The 
N ative Americans by Robert F. Spencer and Jessie D. Jennings 
(1965) was consulted for additional information, when needed. 
Usually culture areas are described by the traditional lifeways 
or ethnographic present time frame of the people who live in that 
culture area. Geographical information was added to the culture 
area descriptions of traditional lifeways simply to help the 
reader identify approximate location of the culture area. These 
culture areas are: 

Arctic. The arctic culture area includes the Aleut and 
Eskimo people who differ from Indians in appearance, language and 
culture. Arctic peoples traditionally live in small bands, and 
move seasonally to fish, or hunt sea mammals or caribou, 
depending on location. Clothing, tools, and other material 
culture are adapted to life in a harsh environment. This culture 
area corresponds geographically with northern Alaska and Canada, 
the Aleutian Islands, eastern coastal Siberia, and coastal 
Greenland. 

Subarctic. Fishermen and nomadic hunters of moose and 
caribou characterize this group. Travel through the boreal forest 
is accomplished by birch bark canoe, snow shoe and toboggan. 




16 



Geographically, this culture area encompasses most of Canada with 
the exception of the southern most lands, the arctic, and the 
Pacific (northwest) coast. 

Northwest Coast. Elaborate ceremonialism and a social class 
structure characterize the cultures of this area. The Northwest 
Coast has an abundance of lush natural resources, particularly 
salmon, sea mammals, and wood. Woodworking is the major art. This 
culture area coincides geographically with the coastal areas of 
Oregon, Washington, southern Alaska, and British Columbia. 

California. California Indians reside in small independent 
villages living peacefully by fishing, hunting, and gathering 
acorns to grind for mush. This area is known for its fine 
basketry. 

Southwest. Agricultural villages characterize this area. 
Southwest Indians excel in weaving and silversmithing. The 
Spanish introduced sheep herding to this group during the early 
years of European colonization. The southwest culture area 
includes lands in present day Arizona, New Mexico, south and west 
Texas, and small portions of Utah and Colorado. 

Great Basin. Small foraging family groups wander seasonally 
in this desert area. People utilize wild seeds, roots, small 
animals, and insects for food. This culture area includes Nevada, 
Utah, east California, west Wyoming and Colorado, south Idaho, 
and southeast Oregon. 

Plateau. Widely scattered groups of foragers (hunters, 
fishers, and collectors of vegetable products) characterize this 







17 



group. People practice democracy, live peacefully in small 
villages, and are known for their spirituality. Groups on the 
eastern plateau adopted the horse riding buffalo hunting 
lifestyle of the Plains Indians. The plateau area includes 
eastern Washington, northern Idaho, western Montana, and southern 
areas of the Canadian provinces bordering these states. 

Plains. Highly efficient horseback hunting characterizes the 
people of this culture area. Most tribes enforce strict hunting 
laws to keep the bison herds intact and to protect their way of 
life which utilizes bison for food, clothing, and shelter. This 
culture area also supports farmers in fortified earth lodge 
villages along the Missouri River. The Plains culture area is 
geographically distributed from the southern sections of 
Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Alberta to the northern and central 
areas of Texas. 

Southeast. People who live in this culture area have a 
social class structure, practice elaborate ceremonialism, and are 
dependent on domesticated maize, beans, squash supplemented by 
hunting for their food. Religious elites control towns and 
temples. The "Five Civilized Tribes" consisting of Cherokee, 

Creek, Chickasaw, Choctaw and Seminole live here. This culture 
area approximates the southeastern United States from Louisiana 
to Florida, north to South Carolina and the Appalachian regions 
of Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee. 

Northeast. Inhabitants of this culture area live in small 
independent settlements located in a watery woodland 




18 



environment. Subsistence is based on fishing and deer hunting 
combined with maize agriculture or wild rice gathering. 

Shamanism, curing and hunting magic are important to these 
people. The Iroquois formed a strong alliance called the League 
of the Iroquois. The geographical equivalent to this culture area 
includes the Maritime Provinces, southern Ontario, south to 
coastal North Carolina, the Ohio Valley, and west to the 
northeast quarter of Minnesota. 

Most Native American children's fiction easily fit in one of 
the ten culture areas described above. Items with insufficient 
data for placement were marked as 'unknown'. Works encompassing 
more than one culture area were marked as 'mixed' unless people 
from one culture area dominate the story. In the case of the 
latter, assignment was made to the featured culture area. If 
provided, the tribal name determined culture area assignment. 

Each tribe, with the exception of the Cree, belongs to only one 
culture area. The unique placement of the Cree in both Subarctic 
and Plains culture areas was made in accordance with the two 
defining reference sources. 

Time frame for each book was categorized as prehistoric past 
(known only from archaeological data), ethnographic present (as 
the group appeared during first contact with Europeans) , 
reservation period (after the Indian Wars and before the post 
World War Two migrations to urban areas), or contemporary (post 
World War Two). Works, such as stories of time travel, covering 
two or more time frames were classified as 'mixed' and those with 




24 



19 

insufficient data as 'unknown'. 

Setting, the physical environment in which the story takes 
place, was divided into rural (country), urban (city), mixed and 
unknown categories based on data from content analysis of the 
work. Books with equal rural and urban components were 
categorized as 'mixed'. Reservations and small town settings were 
categorized as rural. The 'unknown' category was used for works 
with insufficient data for determining setting. 

Results 

Four hundred three works (403) were identified as having 
probable relevance to this study. Nineteen works unobtainable 
before the deadline were dropped but some of these probably would 
not have met study criteria. Upon examination, one hundred three 
books (103) were removed from the study because they did not meet 
criteria for use. Works retained in the study were limited to in- 
print fictional works about Native Americans, appropriate for 
grades K— 6 , which were not traditional tales or modern versions 
of traditional tales. Two hundred eighty one works (281) met 
these criteria. 

Works relevant to the study came from 105 publishers. Two 
hundred nineteen works (219) were produced by 77 mainline 
publishers. Twenty four works were supplied by twelve alternative 
publishers. Seventeen works came from six publishers identified 
as mixed. For twenty one works, publisher status was 
indeterminate . 

Data were gathered and recorded on the Information sheet 




25 



20 



(Appendix A) . Data showed that most fiction works written about 
Native Americans for children were not written by Native 
Americans. Two hundred fifteen books (215) were written by non- 
Native Americans compared to 53 works written exclusively by 
Native Americans. Two works were by a mixed ethnic team. Table l 
shows the relationship between writer ethnicity and publisher 
type measured in works.

Examining the data in terms of the writers rather than in 
terms of the number of works, two hundred ninety seven 
writers (297) produced 281 works. Native Americans contributed to 
58 books (Table 2) while persons not of Native American descent 
contributed to 225 works. Sixteen percent (16%) of individual 
Native American contributions (9/58) were produced by alternative 
publishers compared to 48% by mainline publishers (28/58). Twenty

four percent (24%) of Native American writer contributors were 
classed with unknown publisher type and 12% (7/58) were mixed.

Because of the prominence of illustration, illustrators of 
childrens books are considered to be major contributors to the 
work. Therefore, the ethnic background of the illustrators was 
examined in addition to writer ethnicity. Most works, 211 of 
281, were illustrated. Of these, 38 (18%) were illustrated by 
Native Americans, 146 (69%) were not, and the status of the 
remaining 27 individuals (13%) was indeterminate. Mainline 
publishers produced the most works illustrated by Native 
Americans but alternative publishers had a higher percentage of 
their works illustrated by Native Americans (28%). Table 3 shows

In addition to publisher, writer and illustrator, cultural 
diversity was a component of the study. Cultural diversity refers 
to the variety in culture area, time frame and setting 
combinations. Cultural diversity was determined through content 
analysis of each work. 

Table 4 shows the relationship between culture area and time 
frame for each work. It was possible to identify culture area for 
256 of 281 works (91%). Each culture area is represented but 
distribution of works among culture areas is uneven. Most popular 
culture areas of in-print works are the Northeast with 56 works 
(20%), the Southwest with 52 (19%), and the Plains with 45 
works (16%). In contrast, three culture areas, California, Great 
Basin, and Plateau each were identified with only 2-3% of the 
total works.

Cultural diversity also has a time component. All time 
frames are found in the literature (Table 4). A contemporary time 
frame, with 98 works (35%) proved to be the most popular. The 
ethnographic present, has 78 works (28%) but is most popular in 
the first and third most popular culture areas, the northeast and 
the plains. The southwest culture area has the most contemporary 
(26) and reservation period (14) works. 

Physical setting, another component of cultural diversity, 
shows little variation in the literature. Rural settings, 




24 



predominate. Rural settings are found in 257/281 (91%) of the 
works (Table 5). However, all the physical settings are 
represented. Only three works (1%) are set in urban environments 
and 19 (7%) in a mixed rural/urban milieux. Most of the works 
with mixed rural/urban setting also have a contemporary time 
frame. Setting could not be determined for 2 works (1%). Table 5 
shows the relationship between culture area, time frame, and 
rural physical setting.

The data on culture area, physical setting, and time frame 
(tables 4 & 5), show that literature for children about Native 
Americans exhibits considerable cultural diversity. All culture 
areas, time frames, and physical settings are represented in in- 
print works. However, some combinations of the three variants are 
popular and others are not represented at all. The seven most 
popular combinations in order of popularity are: 1) Plains 
ethnographic, 2) Southwest contemporary, 3) Northeast 
ethnographic, 4) Southwest reservation period, 5) Subarctic 
contemporary, 6) Northeast contemporary, and 7) Arctic 
contemporary. All of these have rural settings. Six combinations 
of culture area, and time frame with any possible setting are 
absent in-print literature. These are Arctic prehistoric, Plateau 
prehistoric and contemporary, Subarctic ethnographic present, 
California reservation period, and Great Basin contemporary. The 
relationship between publisher type and culture area, time frame, 
and setting was also studied. All culture areas are represented 
by works from mainline publishers but not by works from 
alternative publishers (Table 6). Alternative publishers 
contributed only stories set in the Arctic, Subarctic, Northeast, 
and Plains culture areas. The six other culture areas were absent 
in alternative publisher publications. Nine (38%) works published 
by alternative publishers could not be matched with an 
identifiable culture area. Table 6 shows the relationships 
between publisher type and culture area*

Time frames vary with type of publisher. The majority of 
works from alternative publishers have a contemporary time frame, 
while mainline publishers contribute slightly more works set in 
the ethnographic present 71/219 (32%) than a contemporary time 
frame 62/219 (28%). Table 7 shows the relationship between 
publisher type and time frame. 

Physical setting is almost exclusively rural for works in 
this study (257/281 or 91%). Mainline publishers had 16/219 books 
with a mixed time frame (7%) while alternative publishers had

Discussion 

Two hundred eighty one of 300 possible works, were available 
for study. Recognition of appropriate works for the study proved 
to be problem. One hundred three works, selected on the basis of 
title and/or other information such as publisher description were 
dropped because they did not fit the parameters of the study. 

Most rejected works consisted of traditional tales or 
contemporary versions of these tales. Others were nonfiction, not 
grade appropriate, or were not about Native Americans. 

The first issue in the study of fiction books about Native 
Americans written for children is the question of who is writing 
and publishing these works. Critics such as Slapin (1992), Seale 
(1992), and Byler (1974,1994) state that non-Native Americans 
write and mainline publishers publish most of these works. Data 
on in-print books (Table 1) support these statements. 

Non-native Americans wrote 76% of the total works and mainline 
publishers produced 78% of the total. 

Alternative publishers provide a forum for perspectives not 
usually found in the trade literature and support minority 
authors. Alternative publishers do publish fiction books about 
Native Americans for children. However, mainline publishers are 
the source of 219 (78%) works in this study in contrast with 24 
(9%) from alternative publishers. If number of copies distributed 
by publishers is studied, sales of works by mainline publishers 
with their strong marketing strategies would without doubt exceed 
efforts by alternative publishers which are small, independent 




34 



29 



firms. Therefore, in terms of fiction books about Native 
Americans written for children, alternative publishers probably 
have little impact on reading choices for the American child. 

The number of authors with Native American ancestry was 
tallied in terms of ethnic background of writers for each book 
and in terms of examining the ethnic origin of individual 
contributors. Fifty three works (19%) were written solely by 
Native Americans in contrast to 213/281 (76%) by non-Native 
Americans (Table l). The number of Native American writers jumps 
to 58/297 (21%) when each individual contribution is considered 
(Table 2). Native Americans are defined for the purpose of this 
study as anyone claiming to be Native American. However, these 
figures could change dramatically depending on how one defines a 
Native American. For example, if one bases ethnicity solely on 
legally recognized tribal membership, the number of Native 
Americans writers would be reduced. Lastly, some individuals who 
are Native American could mistakenly be classified as non-Native 
Americans because when biographical data is present but Native 
American ancestry is not noted, contributors were classed as non- 
Native. 

Major critics in the field agree that most Native American 
writers publish through alternative publishers, an outlet for 
writers from minority ethnic groups. Horning (1993) states that 
books written by Native Americans are nearly impossible to find 
in mainline publishers' catalogs. The current study shows that 
twenty— four of total of 219 (11%) works from mainline publishers 




30 



were by writers of Native American descent (Table 1). More Native 
American authors (24) published through mainline publishers than 
alternative publishers (9). However, when a comparison is made 
between writer ethnicity of each contributing writer and 
publisher type (Table 2), data show that works by Native American 
writers are more heavily represented in alternative publishers 
(38%) than mainline publishers (11%). I think that Horning (1993) 
exaggerates the situation, since Native Americans write 11% of 
the works of this type, these should not be hard to locate in 
mainline publishers' catalogs. 

Illustrations are important components of children's books. 
Since this study is about children's books, illustrators were 
considered important to the study. Two hundred eleven books (211) 
were illustrated, 38 (18%) by Native American artists and 146 
(69%) by non-Native Americans (Table 3). These totals are similar 
to those of writers. No preference of Native Americans 
illustrating books written by other Native Americans is noted. 
However, one non-Native American author always has her books 
illustrated by Native American artists. Background information on 
the ethnic background for illustrators was harder to find than 
for writers. No biographical information was found on 27 (13%) of 
211 illustrators in contrast to 14 (5%) of 297 writers (Tables 2 
& 3). The same problems in determining ethnicity of writers hold 
true for illustrators. 

More Native American illustrators' work (Table 3) appears in 
books from mainline publishers (24 works) than alternative 




36 



31 



publishers (7 works). But, Native Americans illustrate a higher 
proportion (28%) of books published by alternative publishers 
than books (16%) from mainline publishers. Alternative publishers 
do serve as an important outlet for Native American illustrators. 

The second issue in this study concerned the representation 
and distribution of culture area, time frame and setting in the 
literature. All ten culture areas are represented in this study. 
Distribution of works among culture areas is most easily 
discussed by culture area in conjunction with time frame (Table 
4 ) . The three culture areas most popular in the in-print works 
are the Northeast, the Southwest, and the Plains. The time frames 
dominating the literature are contemporary with 98 works (35%) 
and ethnographic present with 78 works (28%). 

The Northeast, the most popular culture area has 56 works or 
20% of the total, including 23 books about the Ojibwa and 
Iroquois. The current interest in this culture area may be due to 
the popularity of the Iroquois. This corresponds with Lass- 
Woodfin's observations in 1978. The Northeast is the area of 
earliest European contact followed by serious decimation of 
tribal groups. Eighteen of 56 (32%) works carry an ethnographic 
present time frame, the time of initial Native American/European 
contact. Currently, there is much interest in but little 
knowledge of Native peoples of different tribal groups living in 
different time frames in this area. Historical accounts and 
archaeological data can be utilized to provide a basis for 
stories about groups other than Iroquois, Ojibwa, and people 




37 



32 



involved in the first Thanksgiving. 

The Southwest culture area, second in popularity with 52 
works (18% of the total), includes 28 works on the Navajo and 11 
on Pueblo Indians. The Southwest culture area continues to be the 
home of Native American groups who have retained much of their 
traditional lifeways. The southwest is the site of 26 stories 
with a contemporary setting. The contemporary /Southwest culture 
area combination is second only to the ethnographic 
present/Plains Indian combination. Fourteen additional stories 
take place during the reservation period. The retention of the 
unique traditional lifeways of Native peoples of this culture 
area may be the basis for their continuing popularity in the 

literature. 

The third culture area, the Plains, is the culture area of 
the stereotyped Native American buffalo hunter made popular by 
television, the Wild West Show, and movies such as Dances With _ 
wolves . Most of the works about the Plains Culture Area, 27 of 
45 (60%), contain the ethnographic present time frame, the old 
buffalo hunting days. In contrast, only 4 works were about 
contemporary Plains people. Data indicate that the old stereotype 
lives on, pervades the literature about this area but not 
children's fiction about Native Americans in general. 

Native Americans from three culture areas not well 
represented in the literature are the Great Basin, the Plateau, 
and California. Together, these three groups are only represented 
by 20 books or 7% of the total. The Great Basin and the Plateau 




33 



areas are sparsely inhabited by people dependent on foraging and 
hunting. Traditional life in the Great Basin is harsh due to the 
lack of natural resources, and does not share the romance of the 
buffalo hunting Plains cultures. Most of the stories of the Great 
Basin, four of six, take place in the ethnographic present. 

People in this culture area are known for their peaceful 
lifestyles. Perhaps peaceful folks aren't interesting enough to 

write about. 

As in the Great Basin, the people of the Plateau culture 
area, with the exception of those on the eastern plateau, do not 
have the horse or buffalo hunting way of life. Most groups live 
by foraging but natural resources are plentiful. Most Plateau 
Area stories, five of seven, take place in the ethnographic 

present . 

The California culture area, is an area of Spanish 
missionization and presence. Most Native Americans in this area 
lived by hunting and by gathering acorn nuts to grind for mush. 
Three of six works are placed in the ethnographic present and 
one in the prehistoric past. In California, the native population 
was reduced significantly by the time the missions closed. When 
the gold rush of 1849 brought about a large non-Spanish influx of 
people, the Native American population was further reduced by 
settlers bullets, disease, and starvation. The assumption that 
California Indians are extinct, or a lack of awareness that they 
ever existed, or a disinterest in peaceful groups may have 
attributed to the dearth of fictional materials about this 





34 



culture area. 

The remaining four culture areas, Arctic, Subarctic, 
Northwest Coast, and Southeast have 20 (7%), 20 (7%), 13 (5%), 
and 22 (8%) works respectively. The Arctic and Subarctic culture 
areas have substantial native populations living on traditional 
lands. Both of these culture areas contain large wilderness areas 
and are thought of as the real frontier. The Arctic culture area 
includes the Eskimo and Aleut peoples who originally lived in 
small bands and depended on either sea mammals or caribou for 
food. Subarctic peoples are nomadic fishermen or hunters of 
caribou and moose and live in the boreal forest. Both Arctic and 
Subarctic culture areas share an emphasis on stories with a 
contemporary time frame, 10 of 20 (50%) for the Arctic and 15 of 
20 (75%) for the Subarctic. Many of these contemporary works are 
adventure stories written about people in the Arctic culture 
area, usually by non-Native American authors. Five works were 
written by Native Americans, all from the Arctic area and all 
with a contemporary time frame. Ten works (50%), written about 
Subarctic peoples were written by Native Americans from the area. 
The story in each of these 10 works takes place in the 
reservation period or contemporary time frame. 

Northwest Coast peoples, who are known for their elaborate 
ceremonialism and fine wood carving, including totem poles, are 
represented in this study by 13 works (5% of the total). Six 
works have contemporary time settings and one was written with a 
reservation period emphasis. These seven stories focus on 




35 



cultural conflict or portray a Native child in a modern situation 
in his/her culture. Many of the contemporary works were sponsored 
by the Queen Charlotte Islands project which seeks to produce 
culturally relevant books for Native children. 

The last culture area discussed here, the Southeast, 
continues to be popular, primarily because of an ongoing 
interest with the Cherokee. Indeed, in 12 of 22 works, the story 
is about the Cherokee during the infamous "Trail of Tears" or 
modern times. The Cherokee are especially unique because 
they assimilated Euroamerican lifeways prior to their 
removal in the "Trail of Tears". Pre-trail Cherokee were 
literate, owned and operated plantations, and owned slaves. Six 

works take place in the ethnographic present. 

Time frame has been discussed above in conjunction with 
culture area but it is important as a separate issue. Mary Gloyne 
Byler (1992) stated that the past serves as a backdrop for most 
Native American children's fiction and may give the impression 
that Native Americans are extinct. This view is shared by most 
critics in the field. Byler' s statement is probably true if one 
considers all fiction ever written for children about Native 
Americans. However, it does not hold true for in-print works. In 
this study (Table 4), content analysis showed that only 102 
stories in 281 (36%), 24 with a prehistoric time frame and 78 
with an ethnographic present time frame, took place in eras which 
when taken alone, could give the impression that Native Americans 
are extinct peoples. Content analysis also identified 135 modern 




36 



era works (48%), consisting of 37 of the reservation period, 
which ended just after World War II, and 98 contemporary works. 
Most of the 23 works (8%) in the mixed category are time travel 
stories of contemporary children visiting the prehistoric past or 
the ethnographic present. Given the time frames of in-print 
materials, it is doubtful that readers would assume that Native 

Americans are extinct. 

Physical setting is the last aspect of cultural diversity 
examined by this study. It is most meaningful when discussed with 
time frame. Two hundred fifty seven (91%) of 281 works (Table 5) 
have rural physical settings. The persistent popularity of the 
rural setting is surprising since one half of all Native 
Americans now live in urban areas. Stories taking place in 
prehistoric times or the ethnographic present would have to have 
a rural setting because there were no real cities present during 
these times. However, it is interesting that contemporary stories 
ignore the population shift. This is true even for even Native 
American writers. Forty seven of 53 or 89% of stories by Native 
American writers take place in rural settings. Lack of variety in 
physical setting denies the variability of extant Native American 
lifeways. Only three stories (1%) have urban settings (Table 8). 
Most of the mixed urban/rural stories in-print are about Native 
children visiting relatives on the reservation. Eleven of these 
are tied to a pre-World War II reservation period time frame. 
Apparently, an urban setting holds little appeal for writers of 
fiction about Native American peoples. However, a contemporary 



37 



time frame does. 

Cultural diversity within the literature is a major concern 
of this study. Cultural diversity refers to the many different 
lifestyles of groups of people. It is measured here by culture 
area, time frame, and physical setting. The more variation in 
each component, the more variation overall for the group. Native 
Americans. Physical setting, which is 91% rural is the one 
component that shows little diversity. Combinations of culture 
area and time frame show more variety. For the remainder of the 
paper, these will be discussed in terms of cultural diversity. 

Data show that some culture area/time frame physical setting 
combinations are more popular than others. Eliminating from 
consideration the unknown and mixed categories from the culture 
area and time frame categories, ten culture areas and four time 
frames, or 40 combinations are possible. Six combinations (15%) 
are absent from the literature (Table 4). Four of the six culture 
area/time frame combinations not represented are from culture 
areas with a limited number of works. Plateau and Great Basin (7 
works each) and California (6 works). Arctic prehistoric, another 
combination not identified in any book, and Arctic ethnographic 
present with one work, are difficult to identify and may be among 
the six works classified as Unknown Arctic. For both time frames, 
some identifying remark would have to be made for correct 
placement because lifeways in the Arctic have changed little from 
one time frame to the next. 

From what has been written by experts in the field, works 




38 



are expected to cluster in some combinations. The buffalo hunting 
culture, in particular, found in the ethnographic present of the 
Plains culture area, was expected to dominate the literature. 
Peoples of the Southwest culture area were expected to be popular 
story subjects because these people are noted for retaining many 
elements of their traditional lifeways. Culture areas containing 
works about the Navajo and Pueblo Indians (Southwest), Dakota 
(Plains), Iroquois and Ojibwa (Northeast), and Cherokee 
(Southeast) were expected to be fairly popular because of prior 
interest in these named groups. The ethnographic present and 
rural settings were expected to dominate the literature. 

What is available in in-print works is not entirely as 
expected. The plains buffalo hunting culture is the most 
prevalent in the literature but accounts for only 27 (10%) of the 
works (Table 4). Contemporary stories about the Southwest number 
26 (9%); Northeast ethnographic present stories number 18 (6<s). 
Other prominent combinations of culture and time frame exist m 
the in-print literature. For example, Arctic and Subarctic 
stories are usually contemporary. Many stories about the 
Northeast culture area are contemporary. The Southwest culture 
area has a substantial number of reservation period stories. 

The last issue addressed in this study deals with whether 
publisher types specialize in works of specific culture areas, 
time frames and settings. Mainline publishers provided most of 
the books (219) used in this study. Alternative publishers 
contributed only 24 books. The discussion which follows should be 




39 



seen in context of the disproportionate contribution of mainline 
publishers . 

Mainline publishers produced books covering all ten culture 
areas. In contrast, books from alternative publishers covered 
only four culture areas, Arctic, Subarctic, Northeast, and Plains 
(Table 6) . Only one work from an alternative publisher 
represented the Plains culture area. Alternative publisher 
contribution to the Subarctic literature, 5 works (25%) is 
substantial seen in proportion to the small number of books 
available from alternative publishers. Data in this study show 
that alternative publishers specialize in three culture areas, 
the Arctic, Subarctic and Northeast. In contrast, mainline 
publishers contribute heavily to the Plains, Northeast, and 
Southwest culture literature. It is also worth noting that 
mainline publishers supplied all but one work of the Plains 
ethnographic present, the alleged predominant stereotype. 
Interestingly, nine works of the 24 (38%) from alternative 
publishers could not be assigned to a distinct culture area. 

It was expected that alternative publishers would publish only 
books in which the Native Americans depicted would be treated as 
members of distinct cultural entities rather than stereotyped 
characters . 

Publisher type is also a factor in time frames of works. 
Works with each of the four time frames were available from 
mainline publishers (Table 7). Seventy one (32%) ethnographic 
present and 62 (28%) contemporary time frames were the most 




4 



5 



40 



heavily represented time periods by mainline publishers. In 
contrast, 17 of 24 works (71%) from alternative publishers had a 
contemporary time frame. Kathleen T. Horning (1993) stated that 
mainline publishers rarely publish books about contemporary 
Native American people. Data collected for this study do not 
support that assertion. 

No relationship between publisher type and physical setting 
was noted. Twenty-two works out of 24 (92%) from alternative 
publishers and two hundred nine (95%) from mainline publishers 
had a rural setting (Table 8). Most mixed setting works were from 
mainline publishers and the only urban setting identified with a 
publisher type was mainline. Publishers do not specialize in 
certain types of physical settings. 

Summary 

This study addressed questions concerning who writes and 
publishes currently available children's fiction about Native 
Americans and if diversity in culture areas, time frames and 
settings are represented in the literature. The data collected 
supported some popular assumptions and contradicted others. 

Based on in-print materials, the data show that most 
fictional works about Native Americans written for children in 
grades K-6 are written by persons who are not Native Americans 
and are published by mainline publishers. Only 24 works (9%) were 
produced by alternative publishers (Table 1). Fifty three (53) 
books of 281 or 19% (Table 1) were written by Native Americans 
and 58 of 297 or (20%) contributors were Native Americans (Table 




41 



2). Most Native Americans published their work through mainline 
publishers but a higher proportion of works from alternative 
publishers are written by Native Americans. 

Since books for children are usually illustrated, ethnic 
background of the illustrators was also investigated (Table 3). 
Again, most of the works were illustrated by persons who are not 
Native American. Many Native American illustrators were 
associated with mainline publishers but were represented higher 



proportionally by alternative publishers. 

The questions about cultural diversity addressed what 
culture areas, time frames, and settings were represented in the 
literature. Each of the 10 culture areas, four time frames, and 
three settings were found in in-print works. However, works were 
unevenly distributed by culture area and time frame (Table 4), 
and setting (Table 5). The Northeast, the Southwest, and the 
Plains culture area were the most popular, as were the 
contemporary time frame and rural setting. Setting was the only 
component of the three which showed little variation with rural 
settings representing 257 of 281 (91%) of works. The most popular 
culture area/time frame/setting combination was the Plains 



ethnographic present rural or the buffalo hunting Indian. 

However, only 10% (27/281) of the works fit this category so it 
could not be said to pervade the literature (Table 4). While some 
combinations do not exist, mostly combinations with urban 
settings, a wide variety of works is available. The most popular 
combinations of culture area, time frame and setting include the 



ERIC 



•7 



42 



Northeast ethnographic present, Southwest contemporary, and 
Northeast contemporary. All have a rural setting (Table 5). Only 
six culture area and time frame combinations out of 40 were not 

represented . 

Lastly, the relationship between publisher type and cultural 
diversity was addressed. Mainline publishers contributed heavily 
to works about the Plains, Northeast, and Southwest culture areas 
(Table 6). Alternative publishers specialized in three culture 
areas, the Arctic, the Subarctic, and the Northeast. Nine of 24 
works (38%) from alternative publishers could not be assigned to 
a culture area. Alternative publishers did publish proportionally 
more works with a contemporary time frame than mainline presses 
(Table 7). The only work with an urban setting identified with a 
specific publisher type was from a mainline publisher (Table 8). 

Conclusions 

works included in this study were drawn from any possible 
source, special efforts were made, as Goley (1992) suggests, to 
acquire books from alternative publishers. Books used in the 
study were analyzed through content analysis to ascertain the 
culture area of the Native American group featured in the work, 
the time frame, and the physical setting. All three features were 
mentioned by Lass-Woodfin (1978) as defining cultural diversity. 
Some of the data collected contradicts statements of critics of 
the field concerning publishers, writers, and cultural diversity 




found in the literature. 

Mainline publishers do publish most of the works about 



43 



Native Americans but data do not support Horning's (1993) 
statement that books about contemporary Native Americans are rare 
in mainline publisher catalogs. Contrary to what critics claim, 
data do not support statements that alternative publishers play a 
leadership role in promoting minority authors and perspectives. 

Yes, Native American writers publish proportionally more books 
through alternative publishers but the role of alternative 
publishers is minor. Data from this study suggest that mainline 
publishers may receive unfair criticism from some experts in the 
field while alternative publishers reap unearned praises for 
their alleged role. 

Byler (1992,95) states that works by non-Native American 
writers do not recognize the diversity of past or present Native 
American cultures. Data collected and analyzed through content 
analysis contradict Byler's statement. Works studied here do show 
diversity both in culture area and time frame rather than a 
stereotypic portrayal as Byler would have us expect. Byler 
herself may have an inaccurate and stereotypic image of non- 
Native American writers and their works. Simson (1991) notes that 
many Native Americans attended college and are capable of writing 
books about their ethnic group. There are problems with Simson's 
statement. Educated Native Americans are not obligated to and may 
not want to write books about their own people. Additionally, all 
college graduates , Native American and non-Native American, can 
not write books. Lastly, being Native American biologically and 
culturally are two separate things. Did these college graduates 




44 



come from homes in which traditional Native American lifeways are 
practiced? Seale (1992) doubts that non-Native American writers 
will gain sufficient knowledge about Native Americans to produce 
good books. Seale's statement stereotypes non-Native American 
writers as lazy and unprofessional. Generally, critics in the 
field would do a better job if they studied the whole or a 
representative sample of works available. Choosing poorly written 
examples of books by non-Native Americans distorts the true 
nature of available literature and the abilities of those who 
write these books. It is interesting that books written by Native 
Americans do not receive the same scrutiny as works by non-Native 

American writers • 

According to critics of the field, literature about Native 
Americans should show cultural diversity and that Native 
Americans are contemporary peoples. Native Americans are members 
of over 300 distinct and changing culture groups. They are not 
tepee living buffalo hunters. Contemporary time frames are 
necessary for increased understanding and respect of Native 
American peoples and to provide relevant role models for Native 
American children. Literature found in-print in 1995, according 
to my study, portrays Native Americans as contemporary culturally 
diverse peoples. It is surprising that some experts in the field 
who published criticisms in the 1990s may not be aware that the 
nature of the literature has changed. The only valid criticisms 
are that urban living Native Americans are mostly ignored and the 
some tribal groups and culture areas are more popular than 




50 



45 



others. However, the size of past and present Native American 
groups also varies. 

Data concerning the relationship between publisher type and 
cultural diversity proved interesting. Works from alternative 
publishers, expected to show more cultural diversity than 
from mainline publishers, did not. Works from alternative 
publishers were mainly about peoples from three culture areas. 

Most disturbing however, was that nine of 24 works (38%) from 
alternative publishers were so stereotyped or devoid of cultural 
content that no culture area assignment was possible, works from 
both publisher types portrayed Native Americans as contemporary 
people but the urban setting was ignored in works from 
alternative publishers just as it was in works from mainline 
publishers. Alternative publishers were mistakenly praised for 

supporting cultural diversity. 

Since the collected data contradict many accepted 
assumptions of critics of the field, it would be profitable to do 
a similar study in the future. An examination of in-print works 
both limits the project to manageable size and only covers works 
readily available for purchase. Further limiting a study to works 
published only in Canada or only in the United States may 
indicate less diversity in the literature. Extending the study to 
allow a longer response time may allow more works from 
alternative publishers to be included. Additionally, sampling 
works available in past years may reveal trends that resulted in 
the current situation. Possibly, works available in 1990s are 




51 



46 



more culturally sensitive than works written before the Columbus 
quincentennial and the movie Dances With Wolves . What is needed 
more than anything else, is for the critics of the field to do 
fair appraisals of the content of the literature and the persons 
and companies that produce the works, regardless of the ethnic 
heritage of the writers/illustrators and the size or ownership of 
the publishing company.
