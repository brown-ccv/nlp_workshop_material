ABSTRACT 

As one of a series of papers on the unique needs of 
special populations with disabilities, this chapter of the 16th 
annual report on the implementation of the Individuals with 
Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) reviews the literature on provision 
of services to Native American students with disabilities. Native 
American students with disabilities frequently have other 
characteristics that complicate service delivery, including poverty, 
residence on reservations or in other rural areas where services ?>nd 
resources are 'imited, limited proficiency in standard American 
English, and cultural differences that affect schooling. The first 
major section of this report describes numbers and characteristics of 
Native American students with disabilities, including preschoolers 
and school-aged children in public and Bureau of Indian Affairs 
schools. The second section outlines educational programs for all 
Native American students and those that specifically target Native 
Americans with disabilities, and describes funding of special 
education services under part B and part H of IDEA. Section 3 
a.'scusses the provision of appropriate special education services for 
Native American students within the framework specified by IDEA. 
Major areas discussed include identification and assessment, student 
placement, linguistic and cultural issues in curriculum development 
and instruction, and recruitment and training of personnel 
(particularly Native An^erican personnel). This report contains 46 
references. (SV)

5niDY OF Special Populations Native AMERICA^4 Students With Disabilities 



According to the 1990 U.S. Census, 1.9 million Americans, or approximately 0.8 percent 
of the general population, claimed Native American status. More than 5 million 
additional individuals indicated that they were of Native American descent, but did not 
claim "American Indian" as their ethnic identity (Bureau of the Census, 1990; 
Hodgkinson, 1992). Approximately 637,000 Native Americans are reported as living on 
Federally recogruzed reservations or trust lands, with more than 252,000 additional 
Native American individuals living in cities. The remaining number live in rural or 
suburban areas outside Federal reservations (Bureau of the Census, 1990).^ 

Native Americans may comprise a small proportion of the U.S. population, but they 
represent a significant presence in several States and metropolitan areas. Half of the 
Native American population is concentrated in six States (Oklahoma, California, 
Arizona, New Mexico, Alaska and Washington). The reservation with the largest 
population (143,000) is the Navajo reservation, which occupies parts of Arizona, 
New Mexico and Utah. The metropolitan areas with the largest concentrations of 
Native Americans are New York City, Los Ajigeles, Chicago and San Francisco (Bureau 
of the Census, 1990). 

Between 1980 and 1990, the Native American population increased 54 percent. This is 
attributable to a birth rate 28 percent higher than the non-Native American population, 
decreasing infant mortality, and a rise in individuals reclaiming their Native American 
status due to increased cultural interest and decreased racial /ethnic barriers (O'Brien, 
1992; Szasz, 1992). In ti\e 1980 Census, the largest num^ber of Native Americans were 
between 10 and 19 years of age. In the 1990 Census, \he largest Native American age 
group was birth through age 9 (National Advisory Council on Indian Education 
[NACIE], 1992). The current median age of Native Americans is 23.5 years, compared 
to the non-Native median age of 30.0 years. 



DEFINITION OF "NATIVE AMERICAN" 

Within the Native American commuruty, differences in the way the term ''Native 
American" is defined are based primarily on the proportion of lineage traceable directiy

to Native American anc^tors. Defiiutions based on the diffeimt criteria used for the 
data coUections presented in this chapter are described below':^ 

as. Census Definition: In the 1990 Census, individuals were 
counted as Native Americans if thev (1) stated it as their ethnic 
identity, and (2) provided the name of a State recognized or 
FederaUy recognized tribe or native viUage to which they 
belonged. In the Census, the term "Native American" refers to 
American Indians, Alaskan Natives, and Aleuts. Note Uiat the 
procedure used in the 1990 Census was a change from the 1980 
(and previous) Census, when the census-taker rather than the 
respondent determined an individual's ethnic identity. 

• National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP): NAEP data 
on race/ethnicity were self-reported, with few guidelines 
provided to students as to what the term means. The specific 
language of the question asked whether the student is an 
American Indian or Alaskan Native. Race /ethnicity data on 
students who were excluded from the NAEP assessment based 
on disability or limited EngUsh proficiency were provided by 
school personnel; the criteria they used are not known. 

• The U.S. Government officially recognizes more than 500 Native 
American tribes and Alaska Native villages; however, there are 
many other tribes officially recognized by one or more States, 
and a number of tribes are in the process of seeking Federal 
recognition. Criteria for tribal membership vary from one tribe 
to another. Most tribes require a 25 percent blood quanhim 
level, some accept proof of descendancy, while others (16 
tribes) require a 50 percent blood quantum level (personal 
commurucation, BIA, August 1993).

t PERFORMANCE^ ^^^^^^ AMERICANS THAT MAY AFFECT EDUCATIONAL 

'T'^ °" ^^'^ Education (NACIE) (1992) reports that 

347,291 public school students are Native American. This represents between 85 and 
90 percent of all Native American children in school; the remainder attend reservation 
schools admmistered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). To be eligible to attend a 
BIA school, a child must be a member of a Federally recognized tribe, live on a

reservation, and have a 25 percent Native American blood quantum level (O'Connell, 
1987). Approximately 50 percent of Native American childien who live on reservations 
attend public school, witii the remainder attending BIA-operated schools or schools 
operated by other groups under contract to the BIA (NACDE, 1991). 

Although Native American students comprise only 0.98 percent of the public school 
enrollment nationwide, they accoimt for at least 9 percent of school enrollment in 
Alaska, Oklahoma, and New Mexico (Indian Nations At Risk Task Force, 1991). In 
Arizona, Montana, and North Dakota, Native Americans accoimt for more than 6 
percent of public school enrollment. Enrollment of Native Americans students is more 
than 1 percent in 16 other States (Bureau of the Census, 1990). 

Native Americans, as a group, are disadvantaged. Native Americans have high rates 
of poverty and imemployment, low educational attainment, and a 35.5 percent high 
school dropout rate (O'Brien, 1992), about 25 percent higher than the national average. 
Increased health-related problems and a shorter life span than other Americans are also 
characteristic of Native Americans. The death rate from alcohol-related causes is three 
times higher than among the general population (Hodgkinson, 1992), These types of 
problems are more severs for Native Americans who live on reservations or in rural 
areas. 

Only 9 percent of Native American adults have completed four years of college, 
compared to 20 percent of the total population (O'Brien, 1992), Wright (1992) cites an 
even wider disparity, with only 6 percent of Native Americans holding four-year 
college degrees, compared to 23 percent of the total population. 

In addition to economic disadvantage, several other factors may impede the ability of 
Native Americans to succeed in school; these are described in more depth below. 



Residence in Rural Areas 

Most Native Americans live in rural areas, both on and off reservations. The rural 
nature of much of the Native American population makes it difficult to provide 
sufficient support services. Documented problems in providing services to rural 
residents include poor access to services, limited resources, transportation problems, 
and under-utilization of existing services (O'Connell, 1987), The effects of a rural 
location on personnel recruiting, and retention, on service delivery, and on program 
cost are also significant. 

As shown in table 7.1, almost 50 percent of Native American students attend school in 
the nation's smallest school districts, which tend to be mainly rural. This is one factor 
that distinguishes the Native American population from all other small population 
groups in the United States. Approximately 57 percent of the nation's public school 
districts are small, rui'al districts that enroll about 20 percent of the student population 
nationwide (Office for Civil Rights, 1993). Given that a large number of students in the 
general population attend small, rural schools in sparsely populated districts, there is

increased interest in helping rural school districts provide greater educational 
opporttiiuty (Freitas, 1992). In 1990, Freitas conducted a survey of superintendents and 
business managers of small, rural school districts. Based on this survey data, Freitas 
suggests that rural location and small size impact negatively on education because of: 

isolation imposed by terrain and distance; 

declining economies in many rural areas (including high rates 
of poverty and unemployment); 

the financial burden of Federal and State-mandated but 
underfunded or unfunded programs; 

reduced community value for formal education; and 

inappropriate and/or poor fiscal management practices. 

While the districts Freitas (1992) uses as examples are not on Native American 
reservations or tribal lands, many of the descriptions would apply to these schools as 
well. One of the particular difficulties in these districts is the high cost of special 
education, which limits districts' ability to provide a diversity of programs for students. 

Small rural districts in many parts of the country have more limited resources for 
minority education than large urban districts that serve significant nxmibers of minority 
students. Teachers and school staff in rural areas, often trained in large imiversities, 
may be unfamiliar with the cultural and language differences that affect the placement 
and performance of local minority students. In addition, in school districts included 
in a survey of rural schools, none had any formal in-dis<^rict training to ensure that 
Native Americans were appropriately assessed, even among those school districts 
indicating that training was needed (Vadasy, Maddox & Davidson, 1992). 



Language 

Speaking a language other than English as one's first language (language minority or 
LM) or limited proficiency in standard American English are characteristics that 
negatively impact the effectiveness of education for children from smedl racial /ethnic 
populations in tlie United States. Native Americans speak more than 250 native 
languages (Chafe, 1974). Many Native American children, particularly those living on 
or near reservations and trust lands, speak only their native language prior to attending 
school, or are limited English proficient (LEP) when they begin school. Educational 
difficulties and risk factors associated with LM-LEP status are well documented (U.S. 
Department of Education, 1993). In addition, cultural differences between Native 
Americans and school personnel may impact on educational achievement.

Native Americans accounted for 2.5 percent of students in the grade 4 /age 9 cohort, but 
4.1 percent of the grade 4/age 9 students in special education. For the grade 8/age 14 
cohort. Native Americans comprised 1.8 percent of the students and 2.3 percent of the 
students in special education. Likewise for the grade 12/age 17 cohort. Native 
Americans represented 0.8 percent of students enrolled and 1.8 percent of the special 
education students. These data indicate that Native Americans may comprise a 
somewhat disproportionate percentage of the special education population. 

Preschool-Aged Native American Students with Disabilities 

In 1990, the General Accounting Office (GAO) (1990) reported to Congress an estimate 
of the numuer of Native American preschoolers with disabilities and the sufficiency of 
services provided to them. The study was limited to preschoolers at 63 of 297 BIA- 
operated schools on Federcdly recognized Native American reservations in 20 States. 
The data were collected primarily from the coordinators of special education in BIA 
field offices. Researchers concluded that (1) many Native American preschoolers have 
not been identified and are not receiving any services; (2) of those who are identified 
and receive some services, few have completed Individualized Education Plans (lEPs); 
and (3) of those with lEPs, at least 24 percent do not receive all the services 
recommended on them. 

GAO estimated that 8,500 to 12,800 Native American children age 3 or 4 had some type 
of disability. Of these children, 2948 lived on reservations or tribal lands with BIA 
schools. Of these, 838 received special education services in the 1989-90 school year 
from the BIA, from Indian Head Start, from the Indian Health Service, or from public 
schools. GAO reported that the remainder received either inadequate or no services.

GAO suggested that changes in policy, procedures, and /or funding were needed to 
provide more and better services to these young children. 

Native American Students with Disabilities Served in BIA Schoois 

Prior to the 1975 passage of P.L. 94-142, funds and services for Native American 
children and youth with disabilities were minimal and, to a large extent, unknown. 
There were 6,578 students with disabilities, age 6 through 21, served under Part B in 
BIA-operated schools in the 1992-93 school year. Of the Native American children 
served in special education programs in BIA schools, 9.4 percent are age 6 through 17, 
and 5.6 percent are in the transition age group of 18-21 (see table 7.4). BIA does not 
directly provide services for the birth through age fiv- population. That population is 
served through States or State programs affiliated with BIA (U.S. Department of 
Education, 1992). 



Types of Disability of Native American Students in BIA Scliools 

The proportion of students age 6 through 21 with disabilities is approximately 10.7 
percent, which is similar to that in the nation as a whole (Office for Civil Rights, 1993). 
The most recent OSEP data show that the proportion of special education students with 
specific learning disabilities t ;rved in BIA schools (see table 7.5) is 4.5 percentage points 
higher for Native Americans than for the nation as a whole. Dodd and Rose (1991) 
explain that the greater prevalence of learning disabilities in the Native American 
population may be attributable to problems with tests and idenUfication procedures. 
Since the causes of learning disabilities are not well known, however, they also suggest 
that "some of the suspected causes might be more frequent among Native American 
persons." As an example, Dodd and Rose. cite a higher incidence of otitis media 
(infection of the middle ear) among Native American children, as well as studies 
showing a relationship between otitis media and later reading problems. They also 
raise the possibility that the high rate of substance abuse reported among Native 
American people may contribute to high rates of learning d;, abilities in the population. 
Another alternative, explained by Vadasy and Maddox (1993), is that in districts with 
many students with extreme educational needs and a variety of compensatory and 
remedial programs, special education becomes "the service of last resort," where the 
hardest-to-serve students are placed. Thus, Native American children, who may often 
have complex needs in language, learrung, health, and social areas, are often placed in 
special education. 



Native American Students with Disabilities Served in Public Schools 

Little information is available describing Native Americans with disabilities who attend 
public schools or the special education programs and services in which they participate. 
Since Native Americans are often grouped in the "other" category for race /ethnicity, 
their data often cannot be analyzed separately Qohiison, 1991).

Additional data, which included reasons for exclusion, were then collected for all non- 
tested students. 

As shown in table 7.6, in the grade 4/age 9 cohort, 3.7 percent of Native Americans had 
an lEP; this percentage was larger than all other radal/ethnic groups. In the grade 
8/age 13 cohort, 2.1 percent of Native American children had an lEP; tliis proportion 
was only slightly higher than that for whites and lower than that for Hispanics and 
blacks. In the oldest cohort, 3.0 percent of Native Americans had an lEP; this figure 
was higher than that for ail other racial/ethnic groups. 

The sampling design and the small number of Native Americans in the excluded 
student sample do not support drawing conclusions about the Native American 
population in general. Within ihe group of excluded students, however, the 
characteristics of Native American students fit the patterns observed in other data. For 
example, ti\e largest category of disability for the two. older age/grade cohorts is 
specific learning disabUities. In the youngest age/grade cohort, a high incidence of 
speech impairments is reported, as well as visual impairments. Of the Native American 
students excluded from the NAEP assessment, in all three age /grade cohorts, more 
than 75 percent were excluded because of their disability. In the grade 12/age 17 
cohort, another 8.3 percent were excluded for both disability and limited English 
proficiency. In the youngest cohort, nearly 20 percent of the excluded students were 
considered non-readers and were excluded for that reason (NCES, 1992). 



EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS FOR NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENTS WITH 
DISABILiTiES 

This section describes some of the Federal programs designed to help State and local 
education agencies meet the educational needs of Native American children or to assist 
in areas where Native Americans tend to reside. The first part describes programs 
available for all children. The second part describes services specifically for infants, 
toddlers, preschoolers, children, and youth vdth disabilities. 



Federal General Education Programs Serving Native Americans 

Two Federal programs that assist in meeting the educational needs of all Native 
American students are the Johnson O'Malley Educational Assistance Program and tiie 
Impact Aid Program. 

The Johnson O'Malley Educational Assistance Program provided nearly $25 million, in 
FY 1991, to tiie BIA to fund supplementary programs for qualified Native American 
children (including those with disabilities) attending public schools, and to support 
programs for 3- and 4-year-old Native American children. The supplemental activities 
supported by this program relate to education needs, teacher support, and parent costs. 
A total of 225,871 children were served in this program in FY 1991 (NACIE, 1992). 



16th Annual Rsporj To Congress: Chapter 7 205 



The Impact Aid Program, in FY 1991, provided more than $260 million to school 
districts for 123,225 children who live on Native American land and attend school in 
the district or whose parents work on ti\e land. Because these students and their 
families do not live within the district and are not included in its tax base. Congress 
authorizes grants to the districts to help pay for their services. A higher per-pupil 
amoimt is provided for children with disabilities than for those without disabilities. 
This program does not directly serve Native American children by setting aside the 
grants as strictly for use in conjunction with those services, but "indirectly as deemed 
appropriate by the school district" - that is, the monies are used in the district's general 
budget (NACIE, 1992), 

Federal Programs Servir^g Native Americar^s with Disabilities 

Almost nine of every ten school-age Native American children attend public schools 
and are provided special education services and programs tbjrough the same channels 
and funding as any public school student. State and local dollars account for 
approximately 93 percent of funding for all special education. This amount is 
supplemented by Federal special education funding ur der Part B, which allocates funds 
to States based on child count data. States then distribute Part B funds to school 
districts. Public school districts are respor\sible for providing services to eligible 
children, and for collecting and reporting required data to the State. Native American 
students with disabilities who attend public schools and do not reside on Native 
American reservations or tribal lands are served under this arrangement. 

For some Native Americans with disabilities, however, the pattem for special education 
funding and service delivery differs from public schools. As noted previously, the 
Department of Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) plays an important role in 
schools that are on the reservations or trust lands of Federally recognized tribes. In 
some cases, the BIA operates schools or contracts with other organizations (primarily 
Native American tribes) to operate schools. On other reservations and trust lands, 
tribes operate their own schools independently from the BIA.

through 21 in BIA schools is based not on child count, but on a set-aside from State 
formula funds. The IDEA Amendments of 1991 (P.L. 102-119) changed the formula 
used to distribute the set-aside fimds. Originally, the set-aside was 1.25 percent of the 
aggregate amount provided in Part B for students age 3 through 21 to all States for that 
fiscal year. The amended formula sets aside 1 percent of the aggregate amount for 
students age 5 through 21, and .25 percent for students age 3-5, 

The amendments also reduced the responsibilities of the Secretary of the Interior for the 
education of Native American children with disabilities, while increasing the 
responsibilities of Stale education agencies (SEAs) for Native American children with

IDEA Porf B Preschool Grant Program 

From age 3 through 5^ children with disabilities are eligible to receive special education 
services under the Preschool Grant Program. In its 1990 study, GAO suggested that 
Native American preschoolers with disabilities are inadequately served. Researchers 
identified several reasons for insufficient service provision, including an acute shortage 
of qualified personnel in BIA schools and inadequate funding to hire a sufficient 
number of qualified personnel. At the time of the report, at least 61 specialized staff 
vacancies existed. As a result of increases in the target population, field offices 
requested $4.3 million in the 1988-89 school year. BIA provided only $2.7 million to 
promote specific educational services (GAO, 1990). 

GAO (1990) also noted the lack of clear agreement between the BIA and States about 
which was responsible for providing services to young Native American children with 
disabilities on reservations with BIA schools, "These differences could make efforts to 
serve these children difficult and contribute to BIA's inability to serve some children 
for whom it is respor\sible," GAO found. Furttiermore, GAO explained, "Interior 
believes BIA is only responsible for children enrolled in its programs and that it may 
supplement other providers' services. Education and some States believe that BIA is 
solely responsible for all Indian children on reservatiorrs with BIA schools." Subsequent 
changes in law and regulation were made to clarify responsibility for delivering services 
to young Native American children with disabilities. 

The IDEA Amendments of 1991 and implementing regulations included major changes 
aimed at programs for young Native American children with disabilities on 
reservations. These changes wc^re meant to clarify the legal responsibilities of various 
agencies in serving Native American children with disabilities, and to change funding 
patterns to reflect changes in responsibility for service provision. The amendments 
directly affect service provision to children with disabilities who reside on or near 
Native American reservations served by BIA-funded schools. Problems with pre.school 
programs noted by Congress ?n passing the 1991 amendments to IDEA included: 

• lack of clarity with respect to which entity, the BIA or the 
State, is responsible for each student or child; 

• lack of Child Find activity, leading researchers to project a 
population of up to 90,000 preschool-age students who have 
not been identified and who are not receiving services; and 

• inadequate services and individualized educatior programs 
(lEPs) or inappropriate lEPs based upon available, not "needed" 
services (U.S. Congress, 1991). 

Recent changes in regulations for the Part H program, which serves children aged birth 
through two years, represent an effort to provide for a "seamless system of services for 
children with disabilities from birth through 5 years of age." Congress recognized the 
need to provide a smooth transition between Part H and the Preschool Grant Program, 
and to maintain programs that are appropriate and family focused, without overlap in

expectations, access to services, and classroom grouping. Johnson (1991) expresses 
concern that "in the absence of fair or non-discriminatory assessment, appropriate 
educational decisions for Native American students with special needs may be seriously 
diminished." 

Johnson (1992) cites a number of studies conducted over a 10-year period indicating 
patterns of performance for Native American children that are different from those of 
the majority population. Using such studies to interpret the test performance of Native 
American children may serve to better identify those who could benefit from special 
education, and the types of services they need. 

Research studies suggest that language minority-limited English proficient (LM-LEP) 
students are over-represented in special education, particularly within some disability 
categories, such as specific learning disability and speech impairment (Office for Civil 
Rights, 1988; Santos & Santos, 1984). Assessment for at-risk students and for students 
with known disabilities is particularly difficult for LM-LEP students because there are 
few professionals who can admiruster assessments to Native American children in their 
first language, and because many assessment measures are not valid for this group of 
students. This assessment problem makes it extremely difficult to distinguish between 
language difference and disability. 

Furthermore, the assessment of Native American children is complicated by the limited 
number of instruments which might be useful for students from different language and 
culture groups. Since some of the standardized tests used are biased against Native 
Americans (as well as against other small population groups), their use may contribute 
to self-fulfilling prophecies of low achievement among Native American students 
Oohnson, 1992). The following factors contribute to test bias against Native American 
children: 

• language skill differences; 

• physiological factors (such as poor hearing resulting from otitis 
media); 

• neurological factors (including brain hemispheric preferences); 
and 

• sociocultural factors (Johnson, 1992). 

In addition, some tests may be biased in favor of Native Americans. For example, a 
study of tests commonly used in early identification programs (a kindergarten screening 
battery) showed that these tests were biased in favor of Native Americai"is by over- 
predicting achievement. The screening battery included the following: the Peabody 
Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised, the Kindergarten Language Screening Test, the 
Developmental Visual-Motor Integration Test, and the McCarthy Draw-A-Child Test. 
When such a test battery, administered at the beginning of the kindergarten year, 
overpredicts achievement and subsequent testing at the ^nd of the year indicates actual 
achievement well below the predicted achieve lent level, children are then referred to

• involving parents in making decisions about special education 
assessment, placement, and services; 

• schools and commimity agencies working together to make 
good decisions about placement and services; 

• ail special education programs offering appropriate services for 
minority students; and 

• school districts implementing policies regarding identification 
and placement for children with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and 
Fetal Alcohol Effect (Vadasy and Maddox, 1993). 

Information concerning reservation and Urban ties, lanp^^age spoken in the home, and 
participation in traditional customs can provide additional knowledge of the ecological 
context, which can influence test performance (Johnson, 1991). 

Dodd, et al. (1992) conducted a study on the vocational readiness of Native American 
high school students with disabilities in Montana. Part of the study involved 
interviews with school psychologists who served schools with large Native American 
populations or who had Native Americans among their clientele. These psychologists 
recognize that using standard assessment measures with Native American children 
requires adaptations and clinical judgment based on knowledge of the Native culture, 
language, and family systems. Furthermore, they confirm the belief that using the 
standard definition for learning disability (i.e., a discrepancy formula) and common 
measures used to do this result in over-identification of Native Americans with learning 
disabilities. 

The relative importance of formal assessment measures and other types of information 
in special education eligibility decisions is a controversial issue. Most of the personnel 
interviewed in a study conducted by Vadasy, Maddox, and Davidson (1992) indicated 
that professional judgment was extremely important in determining eligibility for 
special education programs. Other factors affecting the placement of Native American 
children in these programs are the availability of other program options and services. 
Many of the educators indicated that they preferred placement in Chapter 1 (SOP) to 
placement in special education, so that they can focus more on providing assistance in 
the regular classroom. 



Educational Placement 

IDEA requires students with disabilities to be placed in the least restrictive environment 
appropriate to their individual needs. Data indicate that Native American students 
with disabilities in BIA schools receive special education services in placements that 
differ from placements for all students with disabilities. Native American children 
attending BIA-operated schools are m.ore likely to receive special education services in 
a resource room and are less likely to receive special education services in either a

proficiency in Native American languages, the lack of qualified professionals fluent in 
them, the lack of curricular materials, and the socioeconomic effect on Native 
Americans of not teaching or emphcisizing English language proficiency (Johnson, 1991), . 

die suggestion for helping Native American children, particularly those with learning 
disabilities, achieve reading levels more comparable to their peers is to use materials 
that are culturally relevant While the diversity of Native American cultures makes this 
difficult to accomplish, the benefits gained in improved reading comprehension scores 
are significant. For students with learrung disabilities in particular, it is important that 
they be able to construct meaning from the text using prior knowledge — i.e., the 
knowledge they hold of \he real worid (ERIC, 1990). 

The adoption by BIA schools of components of "effective schools" models for cultural 
mainstreaun schools reflects the belief that effective schooling for Native Americans 
must account for students' cultural background (BIA, 1988). The research on effective 
schools presents some features that can be applied directiy to Native American 
education. One example comes from a progress report for the 1989-90 school year on 
a pilot program in BIA schools. The project focused on utilizing the effective schools 
research cind process as a framework for school improvement. In this project, eight 
correlates of school effectiveness were adopted, including high expectations for 
students, strong instructional leadership, good home/school/community relations, and 
a clear school mission. Twelve BIA schools embarked on programs to establish and 
work toward one or more of the eight goals. Despite the emphasis on "all" students in 
the goals, however, none of the programs specified any accommodation or specific 
effort for students with disabilities (BIA, 1990a). This study and other reports suggest 
that as BIA schools look to improve educational opportunity for all their students, 
educational opportunity for their students with disabilities can be enhanced by 
specifically including them within the same framework for improvement that they cire 
already using. 

Capper (1990, 1992) examined some of the features of the effective school model in two 
studies of preschool special education settings. She reports that the effectiveness of 
schooling in early childhood programs for children with disabilities differs dramatically 
among sites, depending on socioeconomic class, location, and culture. Capper found 
that in classrooms providing services to children with disabilities from upper 
socioeconomic classes, significantly more time was spent in "intentional learning" 
activities and in fimctional, coordinated activities with clear goals related to future 
educational and societal environments. As the socioeconomic level of students 
decreased, the location of schools moved to more rural settings; and as the culture of 
the students changed from majority to minority, the indicators of effective schooling 
decreased. In her study of five school sites, the site with the fewest indicators of 
effective schooling was a Native American reservation setting located in a remote area. 
The site had die highest rates of unemployment and of individuals living in poverty, 
the lowest educational attairunent level, and the highest minority student enrollment. 
Effective school indicators not found in the Native American reservation site included 
high expectations for student achievement and teacher performance (from the principal, 
the district, and the commuiuty), clear consensus on priorities for school or classroom 
goals, the ability to recruit and retain the most qualified personnel, adequate

context. In addition, some suggestions from the literature as to how cultural factors can 
be accommodated in schools and in classroom practice are presented. 

In a literature summary on Native American learning styles, Swisher (1991) suggests 
that Native Americans' culture, particxilarly in child-rearing practices and in patterns 
of verbal and non-verbal communication between adults and children, contribute to a 
Native learning style that is not well-suited to some of the common practices in "Anglo" 
education. 

One suggested way of adapting schooling to Native cultures is by using so-called 
"discovery" methods. Among Native Americans, a self-exploratory approach is the 
cultural norm. In a school setting, therefore, non-interference and autonomy may be 
valued more tlian directed instruction, which may appear to the Native American child 
as an interference in his/her personal affairs - i.e., his/her learning tasks (Cox & 
Ramirez, 1981). 

In Native American cvilture, observation is the essential tool of learning. Asking 
questions is not a normal part of learning in day-to-day Ufe, but is reserved for school. 
Native American children learn from parents by close proximity and observation, rather 
than by verbal instruction; informal learning tends to be largely non-verbal. Cliildren 
learn by progressively increasing participation in physical activity, rather than by verbal 
instruction. Learning by physical activity is also reflected in Native American 
children's expectation for physical movement. In general, they are accustomed to more 
freedom of movement than is typically permitted (Henry & Pepper, 1990). 

These differences between American schooling and Native American learning styles 
have resulted in the placement of Native American children in situations that favor 
those who are highly verbal and talkative. As a rule. Native American children learn 
faster when the teaching style uses a concrete approach, moving , from concrete to 
abstract, from practice to theory (Johnson, 1991). 

One way to implement some of the instructional concepts described above would be 
to adopt cooperative learning techniques, which have been shown to be effective with 
many small population groups, underachieving students, and students who have mild 
cognitive disabiUties. This approach could be conducted in informal settings, with the 
opportunity for freedom of physical movement. From studies of other groups, and 
from the characteristics observed among Native American children, the use of group 
problem-solving strategies at the eleinentary school level would seem to be a promising 
approach. In mathematics, using manipulatives in this setting would also be supported 
(Johnson, 1991; Schindler & Davison, 1985). 

Another method of adapting instruction to learning styles that seems more congruent 
to Native Americeji culture is the initial presentation of new information in a 
visual/spatial mode, rather than a verbal mode. Included in this approach are the use 
of metaphors, images, analogies, and symbols rather than dictionary-type definitions, 
which are more verbal and abstract. Other methods suggested are creative dramatics, 
role-playing, and visuals rather than more abstract forms of instruction such as having 
students construct questions (Johnson, 1991).

viniqueness" as it affects teaching personnel. At a symposium on Native American 
education held in April 1993 at the annual meeting of the American Educational 
Research Association, the Native American researchers on the panel concluded that due 
to sufficient similarity among Native cultures (and common differences from Anglo 
culhire), there were sigiuficant benefits in having even Native teachers firom other tribes 
teach Native children (Swisher et al., 1993). 

The shortage of trained special education professionals in BIA-operated schools is 
particularly acute. During school year 1990-91, the BIA employed 297 special education 
teachers for all disability categories, but needed to increase this number by 
approximately 60 percent (another 177 hilly qualified teachers) to meet the needs of the 
Native American students with disabilities that it served. In the same year, the nation 
as a whole needed only 9 percent more special education teachers. In some disability 
categories, the shortage of special education personnel to teach Native American 
students is even more severe. An increase of 83 percent in personnel trained in 
teaching students with mental retardation is needed. Currently, the BIA has no special 
educators with training in teaching students with deaf-blindness or with other health 
impairments. There are 2 teachers trained to serve students with hearing impairments 
where at least 20 more are needed, and only 1 teacher trained to serve students with 
visual impairments where 15 more are needed. These shortages are based on personnel 
vacancies and on positions that are not currently filled by hilly qualified staff (U.S. 
Department of Education, 1992). There is significant demand in the entire country for 
bilingual special education personnel, but the need for Native American bilingual 
personnel is even more severe (Baca, 1987). 

Baca (1987) suggests that the desire to work with the population and the ability to work 
effectively with Native American parents are key elements for successfiil personnel. 
In addition, competency in developing appropriate lEPs, sensitivity to the language and 
culture of Native American students, the ability to teach ESL, the ability to conduct 
non-biased assessments, and the development and use of appropriate materials are 
critical. 

One way to develop the competencies required for teaching Native American 
exceptional children is to encourage more Native Americans to become teachers. In 
1989, 13 percent of the bachelor's degrees earned by Native Americans were in 
education. Education was the second most frequently obtained bachelor's degree for 
Native American women. One in three of the master's degrees awarded NaUve 
Americans was in education (divided approximately equally between men ar^d women), 
as were 39 percent of the doctorates (O'Brien, 1992). One consideration for this training 
is that programs at State vmiversities may not be as effective in developing Native 
American special educators as programs based within Native American communities. 
It appears that Native Americans who attend State universities tend to accept better- 
paying jobs in cities and other locations rather than return to reservations. Also, most 
State university programs are not designed to meet the specific needs of the reservation 
(Baca, 1987). 

Swisher et al. (1993) discussed the role of ethnicity in the training of Native American 
teachers. None of the Native American teachers included in their case studies of

education. The ultimate goal of this project is to train education personnel who will 
acrve the Native American community (NACIE, 1991). 



OSEP's Division of Personnel Preparation (DPP) funds two types of projects for Native 
Americfins. "Native American Projects" provide grants to tribal colleges to train Native 
Americans to serve children with disabilities. In each funded project, part of the 
curriculum focuses on incorporating the language and culture of Native Americans into 
the education of Native American students with disabilities. At least 50 percent of the 
trainees are Native Americans. "Projects Recruiting or Benefitting Native Americans" 
is for special education personnel preparation programs designed to recruit Native 
Americans. In the last two fiscal years, funding has been divided about equally 
between these two types of projects. Both types of projects cover multi-year periods, 
and have ranged in funding level from $48,415 per year to $143,335 per year. 

Examples of new Native American Project applications funded in 1992 include: 

* A grant to Northern Arizona University to train 60 students in 
special education at an on-site program on the Navajo Indian 
Reservation. The program will include classroom triJIning in 
special education, training related to working effectively in 
rural areas, working in a collaborative model, and learning the 
cultural attributes of the people in the area. Training will be 
accomplished through regular academic work, by working in 
classrooms on the site, and by assignment to host families in 
the Native American commionity who will instruct students in 
the culture. 

• A grant to the American Indian Resource Center in Tahlequah, 
Oklahoma, in cooperation with Northeastern State University 
and the Cherokee Nation, to train 26 special education teachers 
of Native American descent for careers as special education 
teachers. The program will include both academic preparation 
and practicum experiences focused ^n providing services to 
Native American children with disabilities. 

New Projects Recruiting or Benefitting Native Americans for 1992 included an award 
to San Jose State University to recruit and train minority teachers to serve multicultural 
students with hearing impairments. This project will provide stipends to 40 students 
from various ethnic groups to teach students with hearing impairments and deafness. 
Funds will also be used to revise and expand course offerings to include multicultural 
issues, and to provide this inform'ition to working teachers through in-service training 
(U.S. Department of Education, 1992). 

In addition to these projects, in 1991 DPP funded a five-year technical assistance project 
to develop, improve, and increase the participation of historically under-represented 
ethnic populations in special education training programs. Under this award, the 
University of New Mexico's Outreach Alliance 2000 Project collaborates with other 
institutions to enhance their ability to prepare successful personnel preparation-related
