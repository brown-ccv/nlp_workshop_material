LibriVox volunteers bring you 8 recordings of The Twilight Hour by Susanna 
Moodie. This was the Weekly Poetry project for October 30, 2016. 

Susanna Moodie was an English-born Canadian author who wrote about her 
experiences as a settler in Canada, which was a British colony at the time. Her 
letters and journals contain valuable information about life in the colony. She 
observed life in what was then the backwoods of Ontario, including native customs, 
the climate, the wildlife, relations between the Canadian population and recent 
American settlers. 

Moodie wrote of the trials and tribulations she found as a "New Canadian", rather 
than the advantages to be had in the colony. She claimed that her intention was not 
to discourage immigrants but to prepare people like herself, raised in relative 
wealth and with no prior experience as farmers, for what life in Canada would be 
like. She lived to see Canadian Confederation. (1867) (Wikipedia)
