ABSTRACT 



The Secretary of Education is required under Section 618(g)(1)(B) of the Individuals 
with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), formerly the Education of the Handicapped Act 
(20 U.S.C. 1401 et seq.) to transmit to Congress an annual report that describes progress 
being made in implementing the Act. In summary, the purposes of IDEA are: 

(1) To provide assistance to States to develop early intervention 
services for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their 
families, and to assure a free appropriate public education to 
all children and youth with disabilities; 

(2) To assure that the rights of children and youth with disabilities 
from birth to age 21 and their families are protected; 

(3) To assist States and localities to provide for early intervention 
services and the education of all children with disabilities; 

(4) To assess and assure the effectiveness of efforts to provide 
early intervention services and educs te children with 
disabilities. 

Each year, the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) collects and analyzes data 
to assess the extent to which all students with disabilities are receiving a free, 
appropriate public education, as ensured under the Individuals with Disabilities 
Education Act (IDEA). This Sixteenth Annual Report to Congress is designed to 
consolidate and communicate the results of those data collections and analyses. It 
contains seven chapters and a number of appendices. 

Chapter 1 of the report opens with a brief explanation of IDEA, Part B and Chapter 1 
(SOP) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) and provides a 
retrospective analysis of Federal funding patterns for special education. The chapter 
also includes data on the numbers of students receiving special education and related 
services, the types of disabilities they have, the settings in which they are educated, the 
bases by which they leave school, and the staff who provide them with special 
educational and related services, including the number of additional special education 
personnel needed. Finally, a description of various OSEP-sponsored initiatives to 
increase the number and improve the qualifications of special education personnel is 
included. 

Chapter 2 provides information on the role of the IDEA, Part H and Preschool Grant 
Program in meeting the needs of infants and toddlers and their families, and 
preschoolers with disabilities. The two programs continue to evolve. Implementation 
issues are discussed, and States' progress in implementing the programs is described.

through age five is noted, and the challenges that remain described. Data on the 
number of infants, toddlers, and preschoolers with disabilities receiving services 
through Part H, the Preschool Grants Program, and Chapter 1 (SOP), is provided. A 
final section describes discretionary programs sponsored by OSEP to address the birth 
through 5 population, including the Early Education Program for Children with 
Disabilities (EEPCD). 

Chapter 3 analyzes secondary programs and postsecondary educational results for 
students with disabilities who attended regular secondary schools. The chapter is based 
on the congressionally mandated National Longitudinal Transition Study, recently 
completed for OSEP by SRI International. The chapter includes data about absenteeism 
rates, grade performance, graduation rates, percentage of time spent in regular 
classrooms, grade point averages, and other indicators of sutdent performance. The 
data also measure the effect of ethnic background, disability category, and household 
income on the educational results of students with disabilities who attended regular 
secondary schools. 

Chapter 4 provides an overview of the characteristics of students with serious 
emotional disturbance (SED). Data include the number of students with SED served, 
graduation rates, and placement. Issues regarding the effect of ethnic background on 
identification rates is discussed. A recently created national agenda addressing the 
needs of students with SED is described. Finally, special projects focused on this 
population are discussed. 

Chapter 5 draws information from work completed by the National Center on 
Educational Outcomes. The need for better measurement of educational results for 
students with disabilities is noted. The challenge of finding ways to include students 
with disabilities in measurements of educational results, and reasons for current 
exclusions, are described. 

Chapter 6 describes OSEP efforts to assist States and local school districts in educating 
students with disabilities. The chapter describes the three-year staggered review 
process and the ongoing implementation of State Plan Academies to provide training 
to key staff members from SEAs that are to submit plans. The chapter also reports the 
results of compliance reviews and monitoring reports. 

Chapter 7 contains a review of the literature on provision of services to Native 
American students with disabilities. This chapter is one of a series of papers addressing 
the unique needs of special populations with disabilities, begun in the Fourteenth 
Annual Report to Congress. Under the 1986 Amendments to EHA, Congress 
recognized the unique aspects of the service models for infants, toddlers, children, and 
youth who are members of special populations - migrant families, Native Americans, 
Native Pacific Basin and Hawaiian residents, limited English proficient, and /or rural 
residents. In future years, data will be reported on other special populations, and data 
on services to those populations reported on in this and the previous annual report will 
be updated, as additional information becomes available. The chapter reports the 
number of Native American children with disabilities being educated in the nation's 
schools, their educational results, and placements. Some of the challenges to providing

services to this population are described. Programs focused on providing specific 
training to enable special education personnel to provide services to Native American 
children with disabilities are also noted. 

In addition to the report's seven chapters, a series of appendices are included. 
Appendix A is composed of data tables on child count, educational environment, 
personnel, exiting, population and enrollment, and fiscal awards. Tables outlining 
OSEP-funded personnel training are presented in Appendix B. That is followed in 
Appendix C by a list of contracts awarded by OSEP. Appendices D and E provide 
summaries and abstracts, respectively, of evaluations being conducted under the State 
Agency /Federal Evaluation Studies (SAFES) program. Appendix F provides profiles 
of OSEP's program agenda. Appendix G contains a summary of Regional Resource 
Center activities. Finally, Appendix H contains a summary of programs funded under 
the Secondary Education and Transitional Services for Youth with Disabilities Program.

/6th Annual Report To Congress: Ust Of Acronyms XXI 

:RJ,C ,i 



The Sixteenth Annual Report to Congress examines the progress being made towards 
implementing the requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act 
(IDEA). The purposes of the Act are summarized below. 

(1) To provide assistance to States to develop early intervention 
services for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their 
families, and to assure a free appropriate public education to 
all children and youth with disabilities. 

(2) To assure that the rights of children and youth with disabilities 
from birth to age 21 and their families are protected. 

(3) To assist States and localities to provide for early intervention 
services and the education of all children with disabilities. 

(4) To assess and assure the effectiveness of efforts to provide 
early intervention services and educate children with 
disabilities. 

This report provides a detailed description of the activities undertaken to implement 
the Act and an assessment of the impact and effectiveness of its requirements. The 
following brief summaries provide highlights of the information presented in the report. 

STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES SERVED, THEIR PLACEMENT AND EXITING PATTERNS, 
AND PERSONNEL WHO PROVIDE SPECIAL EDUCATION AND RELATED SERVICES 

National statistics and analyses generated from State-reported data submitted annually 
to the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) are provided in Chapter 1. A brief 
retrospective analysis of Federal funding patterns for special education is also included. 
Highlights of this chapter are: 

• For FY 1993, $2,053 billion was distributed to States for the 

provision of special education to children with disabilities 
through IDEA, Part B, with an average allocation of $411 per 
child. Programs funded under Chapter 1 (SOP) to assist in 
educating children with disabilities in State-operated or State- 
supported programs received an average per pupil allocation 
of $432. 



16th Annual Rsrort To Congress: Executive Summary XXIII 



Combined Part B and Chapter 1 (SOP) funding has increased 
from about $373 million in 1977 to $2,173 billion in FY 1993. 
However, the allocation in constant dollars (base year 1977) has 
risen at a much slower pace. The per child allocation under 
Part B of $411 for FY 1993 represents $169 in constant dollars, 
slightly more than the 1978 level of $156. 

When IDEA was enacted in 1975, it authorized the Federal 
government to provide by 1982 up to 40 percent of the average 
per child expenditure in public elementary and secondary 
schools. At 1992-93 spending levels, Congress provided 
approximately 8.3 percent of average per child expenditures 
through Part B. In order to meet the 40 percent target at the 
1992-93 level, Congress would have had to allocate 
approximately $9.7 billion in funding for special education. 

The number and percentage of children and youth with 
disabilities continues to grow. In 1992-93, 5,170,242 children 
from birth through age 21 were served under Part B and 
Chapter 1 (SOP); this was a 3.7 percent increase from the 
previous year. 

Over half (52.4 percent) the students age 6 through 21 served 
by IDEA and Chapter 1 (SOP) are identified as having specific 
learning disabilities. The number of students served with 
specific learning disabilities increased by 5.4 percent from 
1991-92 to 1992-93. This increase continues a trend that is now 
several years old. 

Approximately 95 percent of students with disabilities received 
education and related services in regular school buildings in 
1991-92. This continues the trend to place more children in 
more integrated settings. 

In 1991-92, 57.4 percent of all students with disabilities exiting 
the educational system received a diploma or certificate, while 
22.4 percent dropped out of school. Over the past five years, 
the dropout percentage for students with disabilities has 
decreased steadily and the graduation percentage has shown 
a general upward trend. 

The number of teachers employed to serve children and youth 
with disabilities age 6 through 21 from 1990-91 to 1991-92 
increased 3.8 percent, while the number of children served over 
the period increased by 3.0 percent. For students age 3 
through 5, the number of special education teachers employed 
increased by 15.7 percent for the same time period. 



XXIV 16th Annual Report To Congress: Executive Summary 

ERIC 24 



• For 1991-92, States reported a shortage of approximately 27,000 

teachers and more than 5,400 teacher aides to serve school-age 
children. For 3- through 5-year-old children with disabilities, 
2,288 preschool teachers were needed during the 1991-92 school 
year, 11.2 percent fewer than in 1990-91. 



MEETING THE NEEDS OF INFANTS, TODDLERS, AND PRESCHOOL CHILDREN WITH 
DISABILITIES 

• There was a significant increase in the number of States 
moving into fifth year full implementation of the IDEA, Part H 
program, with FY 1992 funds (for use in FY 1993). As of 
Julyl, 1992, 18 States and jurisdictions were in full 
implementation status. By the close of the FY 1992 award 
period a total of 41 States and jurisdictions had been awarded 
grants for full implementation. 

• Final regulations amending the implementing regulations for 
Part H were published in the Federal Register on July 30, 1993. 
The regulations incorporated the major provisions of the 1991 
statutory amendments and responded to parents, advocates, 
and providers concerns by updating and clarifying the rules for 
the Part H program. 

• States reported serving 76,449 infants and toddlers with 
disabilities under Chapter 1 (SOP) in 1992-93, a 15 percent 
increase over 1991-92. A total of 66,943 infants and toddlers 
were receiving early intervention services in non-Chapter 1 
(SOP) programs. The increases in the numbers of infants and 
toddlers with disabilities reported under Chapter 1 (SOP) and 
other programs likely reflects States' increasing ability to 
provide more accurate counts of the actual number of children 
with disabilities served as their early intervention systems 
evolve. 

• Although data on the location of the provision of early 
intervention services are generally incomplete, they do indicate 
that the home remains the most frequent service site. Thirty- 
four percent of services are delivered in the home. The next 
most frequent service settings are the early intervention 
classroom (33 percent) and the outpatient center (29 percent). 

• States continue to experience uneven progress as they attempt 
to fully implement Part H. Major barriers reported by States 
include the volume of policy decisions, challenging fiscal 
situations, and a lack of direct authority or power by the lead 



q 16th Annual Report To Congress: Executive Summary XXV 

ERIC 2o 



agency. Fragmentation, duplication, and overlap in services 
continue to be pronounced. 

FY 1992 was the first year all States were required to serve 
preschool children with disabilities. About $325.8 million was 
appropriated in FY 1993 for the preschool program, nearly $6 
million more than in FY 1992. This gain was offset by a 10.8 
percent increase in the number of preschoolers served, 
resulting in a per child allocation of $738, down from $804 in 
the previous year. 

Providing preschool services in the least restrictive 
environment (LRE) has become a central national issue. A 
main barrier to successful implementation of the LRE 
requirements is that many LEAs do not operate preschool 
programs at all, and preschool is not available for any children 
without disabilities. While there are a variety of public 
programs for 4-year olds, the issue is particularly problematic 
for 3-year olds. Moreover, the data available on preschool 
placements do not offer sufficiently specific information to 
determine whether services are being offered in inclusive 
settings. 

A significant relationship between Part B preschool programs 
and Head Start was created upon publication in the January 21, 
1993 Federal Register, of the Head Start Program Performance 
Standards on Services for Children with Disabilities. The 
regulations stress the joint responsibility of Head Start and the 
LEA to enusre that services are provided in a coordinated 
manner that both meets the child's needs and ensures that 
services are occurring in the LRE. 

In FY 1993, 121 new and ongoing projects were funded under 
the Early Education Program for Children with Disabilities 
(EEPCD). This included 31 demonstration projects, 47 outreach 
projects, 29 in-service training projects, 7 research and 
experimental projects, 6 research institutes, and 1 national 
technical assistance center. Also during FY 1993, OSEP funded 
245 projects addressing personnel needs in early intervention 
and preschool services.

ASPECTS OF THE SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND EDUCATIONAL RESULTS OF 
STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES IN REGULAR SECONDARY SCHOOLS 



Chapter 3 presents highlights of findings from the National Longitudinal Transition 
Study regarding selected aspects of the programs and performance of students with 
disabilities who attend regular secondary schools. 

• Students with disabilities who attended regular schools had 
higher absenteeism and dropout rates, and lower grades than 
the general student population. Poor results v/ere 
disproportionately experienced by students in the largest // 
disability categories - those with learning disabilities, mental 

retardation, and serious emotional disturbance. 

• Students with disabilities who graduated from high school 
earned 22 credits as compared to 23 credits earned by 
graduates from the general student population. On average, 
States require graduating students to have earned 11 or 12 
credits in academic subjects. Overall, students with disabilities 
who graduated met this requirement, earning an average of 12 
(55 percent) of their total credits in academic classes compared 
to the 15 (69 percent) earned by students in the general 
population. 

• As a group, students with disabilities spent 70 percent of their 
time in regular education settings. The amount of time spent 
in regular classrooms ranged from 87 percent of class time for 
students with visual impairments to 32 percent of class time for 
those with multiple disabilities. However, performance is more 
likely to be influenced by the extent of placement in regular 
education academic classes than by placement as a whole. As 
a group, students with disabilities spend 33 percent of their 
time in regular education academic classes. Students with 
disabilities who spent most of their time in regular education 
classes were 10 percent more likely to fail a class in 9th grade 
than peers who spent just half their time there. 

• Nearly all students with disabilities had some type of 
occupational vocational education while in secondary school, 
although their experience varied considerably. Students with 
learning disabilities were most likely to have concentrate; in 
a vocational content area. To some extent, vocational 
instruction, as an alternative to academic curricula, ameliorates 
course failure and assists in dropout prevention. Student 
participation in work experience programs also had a sizeable 
positive impact on student performance. 



q 16m Annual Report To Congress: Executive Summary XXVII 

ERJC g7 



On average, students with disabilities who remained in high 
school for four grade levels missed nearly three weeks of 
school per year. Students not assigned a grade level missed 16 
days per year. Absenteeism levels varied widely. 
Approximately 50 percent of students with disabilities missed 
ten or fewer days of school per year. Between 21 and 25 
percent missed four weeks or more of the typical 39-week 
school year. Average absenteeism differed significantly for 
students in different disability categories. Students with SED 
or other health impairments missed more school than their 
peers in most other disability categories. Ethnic group 
membership also appears strongly related to absenteeism. 

Students with disabilities who completed four years of high 
school earned a cumulative GPA of 2.3, compared to a national 
average of 2.6 earned by students in the 1980 sophomore class. 
Students in different disability categories earned quite different 
grades. Students who were deaf or hard of hearing or with 
orthopedic impairments consistently earned the highest GPAs 
and had the lowest number of course failures. Students with 
learning disabilities or serious emotional disturbance tended to 
earn lower GPAs and to fail more often. Sixty-two percent of 
students with disabilities failed at least one class while in 
secondary school. 

Approximately 30 percent of students with disabilities enrolled 
in high school failed to complete secondary schooling. In 
addition, earlier NLTS findings showed that approximately 8 
percent of students with disabilities dropped out of school 
before enrolling in 9th grade. Factors influencing the 
likelihood of completing high school included disability 
category, ethnic background, and household income. 



ACHIEVING BETTER RESULTS FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH WITH SERIOUS 
EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE 

Effectively meeting the needs of children and youth with SED and their families is a 
growing national concern. Chapter 4 provides an overview of the characteristics of 
students with SED, a national agenda addressing their needs, and a description of 
special projects focused on this population. 

• During the 1992-93 school year, 402,668 children and youth age 

6 through 21 identified as having SED were served under the 
Part B and Chapter 1 (SOP) programs. Students with SED 
accounted for 8.7 percent of all children who received special 
education services. Students served under Chapter 1 (SOP) 



mmm " 

XXVIII 16m Annual Report To Congress: Executive Summary 



accounted for 18.8 percent of all 6- through 21 -year-olds served 
by that program. 

The number of children identified with SED has increased by 
more than 120,000 since the 1976-77 school year, and increased 
one percent between 1991-92 and 1992-93. Among all students 
with disabilities served, the percent with SED served under 
Part B has increased from 7.5 percent in 1976-77 to 8.3 percent 
in 1992-93. Identification rates for students with SED vary 
widely among the States. 

Available data suggest there is a high disproportion of SED 
students identified from disadvantaged socioeconomic 
backgrounds, or from minority or culturally and linguistically 
different backgrounds. Males are also disproportionately 
identified as SED. 

Students with SED have lower grades and higher dropout 
reates than any other group of students with disabilities. 
About 17 percent of youth with SED go on to college compared 
with 53 percent of students without disabilities. Students with 
SED also have difficulty maintaining jobs. Twenty percent are 
arrested at least once before they leave school, and 37 percent 
are arrested within a few years of leaving school. By two years 
after school exit, 2.4 percent of students with SED are living in 
a correctional facility, compared with 0.3 percent of all youth 
with disabilities. 

Students with SED are far more likely than any other group 
with disabilities to be served in special education programs 
outside regular schools. In the 1991-92 school year, almost 20 
percent of students with SED were served outside regular 
schools, compared to 5 percent of students with other 
disabilities. Half of all students with disabilities in residential 
programs, a fifth of all students in day schools, and thirty 
percent of all students receiving homebound instruction were 
identified as having SED. The percentage of students with 
SED served in regular schools has decreased by about 4 
percent since 1977-78. Only about 16 percent were served in 
regular classrooms during 1991-92, a percentage that has 
remained fairly stable since 1985-86. 

Many communities lack a comprehensive and coordinated 
system of services that can respond to the multiple needs of 
students with SED. The 1990 Amendments to IDEA created 
Programs for Children and Youth with Serious Emotional 
Disturbance, which called for initiatives to address the needs 
of children with SED. OSEP, working with various 



16th Annual Report To Congress: Executive Summary XXIX 



2 J 



stakeholders, has established a national agenda for students 
with SED. OSEP also supports a number of projects focused 
on improving educational opportunities for students with SED, 
including research projects, model development, policy 
development, and personnel preparation. 



EDUCATIONAL RESULTS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES 

Concern about educational performance of all students has been a major national 
concern. Concern about results for students with disabilities is also growing, because 
there is very little information about educational results for students with disabilities. 
Chapter 5 describes some of the work of the National Center on Educational Outcomes 
(NCEO), which with OSEP funding has been working since 1990 to address issues 
related to assessing educational results for students with disabilities. 

• NCEO worked with a broad range of stakeholders to develop 
a conceptual model of educational outcomes along with 
indicators within eight domains. In general, there was 
considerable overlap between the NCEO model and expected 
results in a sample of 17 States, indicating that many States are 
already emphasizing educational results for students with 
disabilities. 

• A comparison of the NCEO conceptual model with data 
elements in 13 of the nearly 30 national data collection 
programs that collect information potentially related to the 
results identified in the NCEO model show high levels of 
correspondence. Unfortunately, because students with 
disabilities are often excluded from the assessments or 
provided inadequate accommodations, the national data 
collection programs provide little useful data on the 
educational results of students with disabilities. Another 
barrier to use of the data is that terminology for and grouping 
of students with disabilities were inconsistent from program to 
program. 

• Students with disabilities are disproportionately excluded from 
both State and national assessments for a host of reasons. 
Guidelines about inclusion and exclusion, where they exist, are 
inconsistently applied. Students may be excluded for reasons 
that are only incidental to their disability for example, 
telephone surveys usually exclude people who are deaf or use 
telecommunication devices. National education surveys often 
do not include special schools. On some school sampling 
rosters, all students within a specific category were excluded. 
Many large-scale assessment programs allow exclusion of 



ERIC 



XXX 16th Annual Report To Congress: Executive Summary 

o0 



students who might experience discomfort during testing, thus 
excluding a substantial proportion of students with mental, 
emotional, and /or physical disabilities. Finally, exclusion may 
occur if administrators feel the students' test scores would 
lower a school's or district's performance level. 

• Disaggregation of accurate information about results for 
students with disabilities is difficult. Variations in how 
students with disabilities are defined and how their 
educational results are reported exist between State programs, 
between State and national data collection programs, among 
the various types of national programs, and within the national 
programs. 

• To encourage schools and States to report results for all special 
education students, NCEO has identified four major steps for 
creating a results-based reporting system at the State, school 
district, or school level: (1) establish a solid foundation for the 
effort; (2) develop, adopt, or adapt a model; (3) establish a data 
collection and reporting system; and (4) install the system. 

ASSISTING STATES AND LOCALITIES IN EDUCATING ALL CHILDREN WITH 
DISABILITIES 

Chapter 6 describes the efforts OSEP undertakes to assist State and local educational 
agencies in educating all children and youth with disabilities and the refinements OSEP 
has made to its monitoring system. 

• OSEP reviews plans submitted by States on a staggered three- 
year schedule, to assure that SEA policies and procedures are 
consistent with the requirements of IDEA, Part B. State Plans 
must be approved by the Secretary of Education before funds 
can be allocated to the State. OSEP provided substantial 
technical assistance to States submitting plans in 1993 for 
FY 1994-96 and to States that will be submitting State Plans for 
FY 1995-97 in 1994. The centerpiece of this technical assistance 
was the State Plan Academies that provided training to key 
staff members from SEAs that would be submitting plans. 

• Twenty-one States and Outlying Areas submitted plans for the 
three-year period covering FY 1994-1996. Across these States, 
a number of concerns were raised during the State Plan review 
process; issues identified most frequently were related to a 
State's Comprehensive System of Personnel Development 
(CSPD) and placement of students in the least restrictive 
environment. 



16th Annual Report To Congress: Executive Summary XXXI 

er|c oi 



• OSEP conducts on-site monitoring reviews of States and 
territories receiving financial assistance under Part B about 
once every four years as part of the Federal program review 
process. During the 1992-93 school year, on-site monitoring 
reviews were conducted in 15 States and Outlying Areas. 
Eleven draft monitoring reports and eight final reports were 
issued during FY 1993. Two concerns were noted in all eight 
final reports. These were related to SEA approval of LEA 
applications that did not meet all Federal application 
requirements, and incomplete or ineffective SEA monitoring 
procedures for determining compliance of public agencies 
providing educational services to children with disabilities. 

PROVIDING SERVICES TO NATIVE AMERICAN CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES 

Chapter 7 presents information on the characteristics and unique educational needs of 
the Native American children with disabilities. 

• Native Americans comprise a small proportion of the U.S. 
population (1.9 million according to the 1990 U.S. Census) but 
represent a significant presence in several States and 
metropolitan areas. Half of the Native American population is 
concentrated in six States (Oklahoma, California, Arizona, New 
Mexico, Alaska and Washington) and most live in rural areas. 
Approximately 637,000 Native Americans live on Federally 
recognized reservations or trust lands. The U.S. Census 
identified the largest number of Native Americans in the age 
group from birth through age 9. 

• According to the National Advisory Council on Indian 
Education (NACIE) about 347,000 public school students are 
Native American, representing between 85 and 90 percent of all 
Native American children in school. The remainder attend 
reservation schools administered by the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs (BIA). Data from the Office of Special Education 
Programs indicate that 6,578 students with disabilities age 6 
through 21 attended BIA schools in the 1992-93 school year. 

• According to data from the Office for Civil Rights (OCR), about 
44,000 students receiving special education are Native 
American. The OCR data indicate that Native Americans are 
more likely to receive special education services than all other 
racial /ethnic groups, except for blacks. As for the nation as a 
whole, the disability with the highest incidence rate among 
Native Americans is specific learning disabilities. 



XXXII 16m Annual Report To Congress: Executive Summary 



• Federal programs designed to assist in meeting the educational 
needs of all Native American students are the Johnson 
O'Malley Educational Assistance Program and the Impact Aid 
Program. Funding for Native American students with 
disabilities in BIA schools is provided through a set-aside from 
IDEA, Part B. The IDEA Amendments of 1991 changed the 
formula used to distribute the set-aside funds. These 
amendments also reduced the responsibilities of the Secretary 
of the Interior for the education of Native American children 
with disabilities, while clarifying and increasing the 
responsibilities of SEAs for the education of students with 
disabilities who live on reservations but are not enrolled in 
elementary or secondary programs operated or funded by BIA. 
The IDEA Amendments of 1991 also included major changes 
directed at programs for young Native American children 
(birth through age 2) on reservations. 

• Provision of special education services to Native American 
students with disabilities can be challenging due to high 
numbers of students with limited English proficiency, cultural 
differences, and residence in rural areas* Assessment of Native 
American students with disabilities is also complicated by the 
limited number of instruments which might be useful for 
students from different language and culture groups. 

• Data from the Office of Special Education Programs indicate 
that Native American students with disabilities in BIA schools 
receive special education services in placements that differ 
from placements for all other students with disabilities. Native 
American children with disabilities attending BIA schools are 
more likely to receive special education services in a resource 
room. 

• An acute shortage of personnel qualified to provide special 
education services to Native American students with 
disabilities currently exists. During school year 1990-91, BIA 
schools needed to increase the number of special education 
teachers employed by about 60 percent, compared to a need of 
9 percent for the nation as a whole. To partially address the 
need for additional qualified personnel, OSEP's Division of 
Personnel Preparation (DPP) funds two types of projects for 
Native Americans. Native American Projects provide grants to 
tribal colleges to train Native Americans to serve children with 
disabilities. Projects Recruiting or Benefitting Native Americans is

School-age Students With Disabilities Served, Placement And Exiting 
Patterns, And Personnel Who Provide Special Education And Related 
Services 

The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requires that all children and 
youth with disabilities be assured a free, appropriate public education (FAPE). IDEA 
requires the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) to determine how well the 
States are fulfilling this requirement. OSEP uses several data sources to do so. One of 
those sources is the State-reported data required by Congress under Section 618(b) of 
IDEA. States provide annual data to OSEP on the number of children and youth with 
disabilities served under Part B of IDEA and Chapter 1 of the Elementary and 
Secondary Education Act (ESEA), State Operated Programs (SOP). 1 States also provide 
data on educational placements and school exit status for students with disabilities, as 
well as data on the number of personnel employed and needed to serve students with 
disabilities. 



This chapter consists of five sections and a summary: 

• Formula Grant Programs describes the financial assistance 
provided to States in educating school-age children and youth 
with disabilities under two Federal programs, Part B and 
Chapter 1 (SOP). 

• Number of Students Served under Part B and Chapter 1 (SOP) 
. reports the number of children and youth with disabilities age 

6 through 21 receiving services through these two programs 
during the 1992-93 school year and describes certain trends. 

• Educational Placements of Students with Disabilities describes 
students' educational placements during the 1991-92 school 
year. 

• Students with Disabilities Exiting the Educational System reports 
the status of students age 14 through 21 who exited the 
educational system in 1991-92. Revisions to the collection of 
data on student exit status, which will be implemented next 
year, and the results of a pilot test of Project PASS 
(Performance Assessment for Self-Sufficiency), are outlined. 



1 For simplicity, these two laws wlH be refef red to as Part B and Chapter 1 (SOP) throughout this report.

FORMULA GRANT PROGRAMS 

Two major Federal programs provide States with financial assistance to educate school- 
age children and youth with disabilities - the Part B State Grant Program, and 
Chapter 1 (SOP). This section provides a brief overview of these two funding sources. 
Two other formula grant programs authorized under IDEA - the Part H Program for 
Infants and Toddlers with Disabilities and the Part B, Section 619 Preschool Grant 
Program - are described in Chapter 2. 2 



The Part B State Grant Program 

Each year, the Part B program distributes funds to the States according to the total 
number of students with disabilities reported by the States as receiving special 
education and related services. On December 1 of each year, each State Educational 
Agency (SEA) conducts an annual child count and submits it to OSEP. The State's 
Part B grant for the next fiscal year is based on that count. 

Table 1.1 summarizes the amount of Part B funding appropriated for States for FY 1977 
through FY 1993. Funds appropriated under Part B have increased steadily from 
$251,770,000 in FY 1977 to $2,052,730,000 in FY 1993. In the same period, the average 
per child allocation under Part B also increased, from $71 to $411. 

At least 75 percent of the funds that a State receives under Part B must be distributed 
to local educational agencies (LEAs) and intermediate educational units (IEUs) to assist 
in the education of students with disabilities [20 U.S.C. §1411(c)(l)(B)]. The LEAs and 
IEUs are required to ensure that these funds do not supplant State and local 
expenditures but instead pay for the excess costs 3 of providing special education and 
related services to students with disabilities. Part B permits SEAs to set aside up to 25 
percent of the Part B grant for their own use. Of these set-aside funds. States may use 
up to 5 percent of the grant or $450,000, whichever is greater, for administrative costs. 
States may use the remaining 20 percent of the set-aside funds for two purposes: 
providing direct and support services for children and youth with disabilities or paying 
the administrative costs of monitoring and compliance investigations, to the extent that 
such expenditures exceed the costs incurred for monitoring and compliance during 
FY 1985. 



These two programs will be referred to as Part H and the Preschool Grant Program throughout this report. 

20 U.S.C. §1401(a)(21) of the IDEA defines 'excess costs' as 'costs which are In excess of i>,e average annual per student expenditure In a local 
educational agency during the preceding school year for an elementary or secondary school student'

Chapter 1 (SOP) Program for Children with Disabilities 

Since 1965, Chapter 1 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, also referred to 
as P.L. 89-313, has provided funds to the States to assist in the education of children 
with disabilities in State-operated or State-supported programs (SOPs). A 1975 
amendment allowed States to count children who had transferred from SOP programs 
to LEAs programs. ESEA was reauthorized and amended by P.L. 100-297, the 
Hawkins-Stafford Elementary and Secondary School Improvement Amendments of 
1988, through FY 1993. Table 1.2 shows the total amount of funds distributed and the 
average per child allocation for Chapter 1 (SOP) and its predecessor programs for FY 
1966-93.

16th Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 1 



Funding Levels for Part B and Chapter 1 (SOP) 

Combined funds allocated under Part B and Chapter 1 (SOP) have increased from about 
$373 million in 1977 to $2,179 billion in 1993. As shown in figure 1.1, the allocation in 
current dollars has increased quite rapidly. The allocation in constant dollars (base 
year: 1977), which accounts for inflation, has also increased, but at a slower pace.

However, the rise in appropriations, even in constant dollars, has been offset by the 
increased number of students served by Part B and Chapter 1 (SOP) programs. For 
example, analysis of the per child allocation data shows that in 1993, the Part B 
allocation provided $411 per child. While this represents a significant increase in 
current dollars since 1977, in constant dollars the per pupil allocation is $169, slightly 
more than the 1978 level of $156 (see figure 1.2). 

When IDEA, Part B was passed in 1975, Congress implemented a grant program to 
assist States in assuring that all children with disabilities have available a free 
appropriate public education. The act authorized the Federal government to provide,

by 1982, up to 40 percent of the average per child expenditure in public elementary and 
secondary schools to assist States in meeting the needs of children with disabilities. At 
1992-93 spending levels, Congress provided approximately 8.3 percent of average per 
child expenditures through Part B. In order to meet the 40 percent target at the 1992-93 
levels, Congress would have had to allocate approximately $9.7 billion in funding for 
special education. 

One factor contributing to a flat per-pupil allocation in constant dollars is that Congress 
has increased funding for Part B while decreasing funding for Chapter 1 (SOP) over the 
last few years. Since enactment of IDEA in 1976, the Chapter 1 (SOP) average per child 
allocation reached its peak in 1979 ($635). The 1993 average per-child allocation of $432 
represents the second consecutive year of decreased funding. Before Part B was 
implemented, Chapter 1 (SOP) was the only Federal funding source for serving 
students with disabilities. Even after Part B implementation, the Chapter 1 (SOP) 
program enabled States to receive funds for children with disabilities from birth to age 
21, while Part B authorized grants based on a count of children with disabilities age 3 
to 21. The continued decrease in Chapter 1 (SOP) funding continues the process, 
started by Congress in 1992, of merging the Chapter 1 (SOP) program with programs 
authorized under IDEA.

NUMBER OF STUDENTS SERVED UNDER PART B AND CHAPTER 1 (SOP) 



During the 1992-93 school year, 5,170,242 children from birth through age 21 received 
special education and related services under the Part B and Chapter 1 (SOP) programs, 
3 7 percent more than were served in 1991-92 (see table 1.3). Even after the nation s 
population increases are considered, consistent increases in the proportion of children 
and youth identified as having disabilities remain. Approximately 6.4 percent of all 
children from birth through age 21 in the resident population were served under Part B 
or Chapter 1 (SOP) special education programs in 1992-93, compared with 4.5 percent 
in 1976-77 This growth. could be due to the increased percentage of the nations 
children living in poverty (Children's Defense Fund, 1989), increased prenatal exposure 
to alcohol and drugs (Miller, 1989), or fiscal incentives for identifying students in need 
of supplemental services (Shapiro, Loeb, & Bowermaster, 1993). 



Disabilities of Students Served under Part B and Chapter 1 (SOP) 

The increases in the number of students with disabilities served under Part B and 
Chapter 1 (SOP) noted in table 1.3 are almost entirely attributable to increases in the 
number of students identified with specific learning disabilities. In just one year, from 
1991-92 to 1992-93, the number of students age 6 through 21 with learning disabilities 
crew from 2,247,023 to 2,369,385, an increase of 122362 students. Furthermore, this 
increase has been steady for several years. As noted in table 1.4, students with specific 
learning disabilities now account for more than half of all students with disabilities 
(51.1 percent) and 5.2 percent of all students age 6 through 17 enrolled in school. 

Students with speech or language impairments (21.6 percent), mental retardation (11.5 
percent), and serious emotional disturbance (8.7 percent) make up an additional 41 8 
percent of all students age 6 through 21 with disabilities. However, even the 
percentages of students with these common disabilities are decreasing as the percentage 
of students with specific learning disabilities continues to grow. 

In addition to specific learning disabilities, three other disability groups made up a 
larger proportion of the total special education population in 1992-93 than in 1991-92. 
They are autism (0.3 percent compared with 0.1 percent), traumatic brain injury (0.1 
percent compared with .007 percent), and other health impairments (1.4 percent 
compared with 1.3 percent). This is only the second year data were collected on the 
number of children with autism and traumatic brain injury. The number of students 
reported in these two groups will probably continue to grow as State and local 
educational agencies identify and count these children as unique populations of 
students with disabilities. 4 



• Until 1981-92, these students wsre reported under other disability categories such as other health Impairments.

16th Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 1 



The increase in the number and percentage of students with other health impairments 
J\ a cW t0 3 1991 memorandum froi n the Department of Education to the States 

(OSERS, 1991). This memorandum states that students with Attention Deficit Disorder 
(ADD) may be included in the "other health impairments" category when ADD is a 
chrome or acute health problem resulting in limited alertness that adversely affects 
educational performance. 

The number of students reported in the three disability categories - autism, traumatic 
brain injury, and other health impairments - will probably continue to grow over the 
next few years. Nevertheless, students with autism and traumatic brain injury are 
expected to remain a small proportion of all students with disabilities. The greatest 
potential for growth lies in the category for children with other health impairments, 
since an estimated 3 to 5 percent of all children suffer from ADD (McBurnett, Lahey 
& Pfiffner, 1993). However, not all children with ADD qualify for services under IDEA 
and many other students with ADD also have other disabilities, such as specific 
learning disabilities or serious emotional disturbance (SED). It is unclear how many 
students with ADD will be reported in the category for students with other health 
impairments. 

As shown in figure 1.3, between 1976-77 and 1992-93 the percentage of students age 6 
through 21 served under IDEA who had specific learning disabilities increased from 
23.8 percent to 52.4 percent, while the percentage of students served who had mental 
retardation dropped from 24.9 percent to 10.9 percent. The percentage of students 
served who had less prevalent disabilities (sensory impairments, traumatic brain injury, 
autism, other health impairments, orthopedic impairments, and multiple disabilities) 
decreased consistently from 1976-77 to 1983-84, but has gradually increased since that 
time. 

OSEP is investigating the caiises of the continued growth in the number and percentage 
of students identified with specific learning disabilities. States and districts that have 
reported large increases are participating in a series of structured interviews to uncove/ 
possible explanations for these trends. OSEP plans to include the results of this study 
in the 17th Annual Report to Congress. 

EDUCATIONAL PLACEMENTS OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES 

IDEA and its corresponding regulations require that each student have an 
individualized education plan (IEP) that defines appropriate educational services. 
Moreover, IDEA specifies that "to the maximum extent appropriate, children with 
disabilities, including children in public or private institutions or other care facilities, 
are educated with children who are not disabled, and that special classes, separate 
schooling, or other removal of children with disabilities from the regular educational 
environment occurs only when the nature or severity of the disability is such that 
education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be 
achieved satisfactorily" [20 U.S.C. §1412(5)(B)]. The implementing regulations for IDEA 
further specify "that a continuum of alternative placements [be] available to meet the

needs of children with disabilities for special education and related services." The 
continuum of alternative placements is to include instruction in regular classes, special 
classes, special schools, home instruction, and instruction in hospitals and institutions. 
In addition, supplementary aides and services (such as resource room or itinerant 
instruction) are to be provided in conjunction with regular class placement (34 CFR 
§300.551). 

Each year OSEP collects data from States and Outlying Areas on the number of 
students with disabilities served in each of the IDEA-specified educational 
environments (see figure 1.4). Students served in correctional facilities and parent- 
initiated private school placements are reported twice, once by educational placement 
(e.g., regular class, resource room) and once under correctional facilities or parent- 
initiated private school placements. Figure 1.4 shows that during the 1991-92 school 
year, most school-age students with disabilities were served in regular class (34.9 
percent) or resource room (36.3 percent) placements. An additional 23.5 percent of 
students were served in separate classes within regular school buildings, while 3.9 
percent were served in separate schools, 0.9 percent were served in residential facilities, 
and 0.5 percent were in homebound /hospital programs.

Placement Patterns by Age Group 

Placement patterns differ considerably from one age group to another, as shown in 
figure 1.5. A greater percentage of younger school-age students than older students are 
served in regular class placements. 

In a continuation of this trend, far greater percentages of students age 18 through 21 
are served m separate school and residential facility placements. It is possible that the 
relatively large percentage of students age 18 through 21 served m separate schools 
(11.5 percent) reflects the presence of numbers of students with more severe disabilities 
who have not completed secondary school within the usual time frame. This group 
may also include some older students with disabilities who are served in specialized 
vocational programs or other transition programs that may be located in separate 
classes or schools.

Placement Patterns by Disability 

As shown in table 1.5, students' educational placements vary considerably, and the 
variations are related to the nature of the students' disabilities. As a rule, students 
with disabilities who tend to require more specialized educational programming, such 
as those with deaf-blindness and multiple disabilities, are served in more restrictive 
placements such as separate classes, separate schools, and residential facilities. On the 
other hand, students with mild learning disabilities or with speech or language 
impairments are more often served in regular class and resource room placements. 

Data for school year 1991-92 indicate that students with speech and language 
impairments were served almost exclusively in regular classrooms (85.5 percent) and 
resource room placements (9.1 percent). Students with specific learning disabilities 
were also served primarily in more integrated settings, with 24.7 percent in regular 
classes and 54.2 percent in resource rooms.

16th Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 2 14 



Students with mental retardation, as a group, were less integrated into regular 
classroom settings. They were typically served in resource room (25.4 percent) and 
separate classroom (59.2 percent) placements. Likewise, students with other health 
impairments, orthopedic impairments, and serious emotional disturbance (SED) were 
generally served in regular school buildings, but they wore distributed fairly evenly 
across regular class, resource room, and separate classroom pbrements. 

Students with hearing impairments or visual impairment- > > -><ved across the 
continuum of educational placements. Specifically, 27;) i-o.- nt m students with 
hearing impairments and 39.6 percent of students with x k.i.il m T a.unents were served 
in regular classes. At the other end of the continuum. 21.2 penent of students with 
hearing impairments and 19.5 percent of students with visual impairments were served 
in separate schools, residential facilities, or homebound/hospial placements. This 
broad distribution may reflect the wide-ranging severity oi sensory impairments, 
differing approaches to meeting the needs of students with i! „- .. impairments, or the 
historic reliance on residential facilities to serve these populations. 

Students in the most restrictive placements included those with d, of -blindness, multiple 
impairments, autism, and traumatic brain injury. Separate classi oom placements were 
most common for students with mental retardation, multiple disabilities, autism and 
SED (59.2 percent, 47.1 percent, 48.5 percent, and 36.9 percent, respectively). Separate 
schools also served a large percentage of students with the following disabilities: 21.2 
percent of students with deaf-blindness, 22.6 percent of students with multiple 
disabilities, 35.9 percent of students with autism, and 53.4 percent of students with 
traumatic brain injury. Furthermore, 28.6 percent of students with deaf-blindness were 
served in residential facilities. 

In the past, one often assumed a correlation between the intensity of the special 
education services provided and the restrictiveness of the educational placement. That 
is students in separate classes generally received a greater number of hours of special 
education per week and had a smaller pupil-teacher ratio than did students in regular 
class or resource room placements. However, efforts to serve students in regular 
classroom settings have increased, and this assumption may no longer be valid. Many 
local school districts are providing intensive special education services within regular 
classroom or resource room settings. As a result, OSEP recently convened a task force 
to consider the nature of educational placements data collection. Changes to the data 
collection will continue to be examined by the task force. 



STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES EXITING THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM 

Each year since 1984-85, OSEP has collected data from States on the number of students 
with disabilities age 14 and older exiting the educational system. . heso date i are 
categorized by disability, age, and basis of exit. During the 1<*> ! ■ >2 s< 1 lmiI year 229,368 
students with disabilities exited the educational system. As shown in figure 1.6, 43.9

of completion or other form of modified diploma A .mall percentage of students,

1.9 percent reached the maximum age for services (21) and consequently exited the 
educational system without completing graduation requirements. Some 22.4 percent 
of students with disabilities exiting the educational system did so by dropping out of 
school, and an additional 18.3 percent exited with status unknown - that is, their 
reason for exiting is unknown. 

Over the past five years, the dropout percentage for students with disabilities has 
decreased steadily from 27.4 percent to 22.4 percent, and the graduation percentage has 
shown a general upward trend. However, the graduation percentage decreased slightly 
(from 45.7 to 43.9 percent) from 1990-91 to 1991-92. During the same time period, the 
dropout percentage decreased slightly (from 23.3 percent to 22.4 percent), and the status 
unknown category grew considerably (from 15.8 percent to 18.3 percent). 

Until the status unknown category data is clarified, questions will remain about the 
exact percentage of students with disabilities graduating or dropping out each year. 
As in previous years, most of those who exited school with status unknown came from 
a limited number of States. California reported 12,283 of its students exiting with status 
unknown. This figure accounted for 29 percent of the nation's total. Michigan reported 



16 



16m Annual Report To Congress; chapter 1 



ERIC 



10,424 students exiting with status unknown, which accounted for an additional 25 
percent of the status unknown exiters nationally. 

Whereas at one time OSEP assumed that students in the status unknown exit category 
were dropouts, more recent research has indicated that this is not always so. Rather, 
students who returned to regular education programs, died, or moved without 
requesting transcripts — as well as dropouts - were often reported in this category 
(Decision Resources Corporation, 1989). 

Beginning with the collection of 1992-93 data, OSEP used new categories to classify 
students exiting educational programs. The new exit categories were developed in 
order to make OSEP data more comparable with data collected by the National Center 
on Educational Statistics (NCES) on the dropout rate in the general student population, 
and also to more closely reflect data currently collected by SEAs. To improve the 
accuracy of the data, counts of students who exit special education will be collected, 
and the status unknown exit category will be eliminated. The new data format is 
optional in 1992-93 and required in 1993-94. The new exit categories, compared with 
the old categories, are shown in table 1.6.

The revised exiting data will also be analyzed differently. Percentages of students in 
each category are calculated using the December 1 child count as the denominator. In 
addition to reporting the percentage of exiters by category, OSEP will also report the 
percentage of all students with disabilities 14 and older exiting in each category in a given 
year. 

This new data format and additional computation will make it easier to compare 
dropout statistics between general education and special education. For example, the 
new computation would show that approximately 3.6 percent of students with 
disabilities age 14 and older dropped out of school in 1991-92. Only the very general 



16th Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 1 



17 



statistic that 22.4 percent of ail students who exited school in 1991-92 did so by 
dropping out is available using the traditional OSEP calculation. 

For school year 1991-92, the percentage of students exiting through each basis varied 
considerably from one disability group to another. Still, in many categories, most 
students received a diploma. As shown in table 1.7, 50 percent or more of students 
with specific learning disabilities, hearing impairments, orthopedic impairments, visual 
impairment , deaf-blindness, and traumatic brain injury leaving the educational system 
graduated with a standard high school diploma. In fact, graduation with a diploma 
was the most common basis of exit for all disability groups but one. Among students 
with SED, 35.0 percent exited by dropping out of school, while 28.1 percent graduated 
with diplomas. 



Services Anticipated to Be Needed by Exiting Students with Disabilities: Results 
of the PASS Pilot Test 

Project PASS (Performance Assessment for Self-Sufficiency) is designed to respond to 
the needs of local, State, and Federal agencies for information about the post-school 
services required by students with disabilities as they make the transition from 
secondary school to adult service delivery systems. The PASS system has two main 
components. The first is the PASS instrument, which obtains teachers' assessments of 
the functional performance of exiting students with disabilities in four areas - daily 
living, personal and social development, employment, and educational performance. 
The second is the PASS expert system, which converts PASS data into individual and 
aggregate projections of anticipated service needs of exiting students. 

More than 100 districts in 10 States participated in a field test of the administrative 
procedures for collecting PASS data from schools. The test results will guide PASS 
instrument and expert system refinement. Preliminary results from the pilot test are 
promising: 

• Participating States and districts were able to coordinate and 
collect the required data in a timely manner, and the burden to 
State and local staff was generally reasonable. 

• Participants were supportive of the PASS system. They saw its 
integration within their existing or planned data systems as 
feasible and desirable. 

• State and local coordinators and teachers recognized, and were 
enthusiastic about, the usefulness of the PASS system for: 

providing data about anticipated services at the 
Federal and State levels;

between student performance and service needs; 

providing data that can be used to demonstrate the 
needs of students with disabilities; and 

raising consciousness regarding the educational and 
transition needs and progress of students with 
disabilities. 

If the PASS approach results in valid projections of adult service needs, it will probably 
be the method all States will use to meet the statutory requirements for reporting these 
data. 



PERSONNEL EMPLOYED AND NEEDED TO SERVE STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES 

In order to ensure that all students with disability have access to a free appropriate 
public education, there must be an adequate supply of special education personnel, 
including teachers, diagnostic staff, related services personnel, and other instructional 
and non-instructional staff. Each year, States report to OSEP the number of teachers 
and other staff employed to provide special education and related services to students 
with disabilities. They also report the number of additional staff needed in cases where 
shortages exist or positions are filled by staff members who are not fully certified or 
trained. Data are not collected about the numbers of regular education teachers who 
work with students with disabilities. 

This section presents data on the number of teachers and other staff employed and the 
number needed to serve students with disabilities. The data on teachers employed and 
needed are reported in full-time equivalents (FTE) and, for school-age children, are 
grouped according to the disability of the students served. 5 Staff other than teachers 
are reported by type of position and are also reported in FTEs.

20 16th Annual Report To Congress: Chapter J 



Personnel Employed to Serve Students with Disabilities 



During the 1991-92 school year, 308,904 FTE special education teachers (see table 1.8) 
and 311,490 FTE staff other than teachers (see table 1.9) were employed to serve 
students with disabilities age 6 through 21. These figures do not include regular 
classroom teachers and other staff who provide services to students with and without 
disabilities as part of the general education program. 

Almost one-third of all the teachers employed to serve students with disabilities age 6 
through 21 (97,805 FTE teachers) taught students with specific learning disabilities. 
This proportion is not surprising, given that more than half of all students age 6 
through 21 with disabilities are identified as having specific learning disabilities. A 
large number of special education teachers (69,919 FTE) also worked with students in 
cross-caxegorical classes, where students with a variety of disabilities are served. 
Teacher aides, or paraprofessionals, made up the majority of staff other than teachers 
employed to serve students with disabilities (170,397 FTE), as noted in table 1.8. 

From 1990-91 to 1991-92, the number of teachers employed to serve students with 
disabilities age 6 through 21 increased by 3.8 percent. This change compares to the 3.0 
percent increase in the number of students with disabilities age 6 through 21 served 
under Part B and Chapter 1 (SOP). For students age 3 through 5, the number of special 
education teachers employed increased from 15,192 in 1990-91 to 17,579 in 1991-92, or 
15.7 percent. 



Personnel Needed to Serve Students with Disabilities 

Despite annual increases in the number of teachers and other staff employed to serve 
school-age children, States reported in 1991-92 that they needed 27,282 additional FTE 
teachers to fill funded vacancies and replace teachers who were not adequately trained. 
This figure marks a 1.3 percent increase in the number of teachers needed in 1990-91. 
Table 1.10 shows that teachers of students with specific learning disabilities are in 
shortest supply and are 29.3 percent of all special education teachers needed. Teachers 
of students with speech or language impairments or with SED, as well as teachers in 
cross-categorical programs, are also in especially short supply. For 3- through 5-year- 
old students with disabilities, 2,288 preschool teachers were needed during the 1991-92 
school year, 11.2 percent fewer than in 1990-91. 

In the category of staff other than teachers, States reported needing an additional 5,448 
FTE teacher aides, by far the greatest need for personnel As in previous years, States 
also reported needing sizeable numbers of psychologists and other non-instructional 
staff such as nurses and psychiatrists, occupational therapists, and physical therapists.

OSEP Activities on Personnel Data 

As noted in last year's annual report to Congress, the 1990 Amendments to IDEA 
(P.L. 101-476) substantially changed the requirements for collecting data regarding 
special education and related services personnel Although IDEA has required 
personnel data collection since its inception, the amendments required for the first time 
that OSEP provide information on personnel supply and that it collect data enabling 
it to make a five-year projection of personnel demand. Soon after enactment of P.L. 
101-476, OSEP engaged in a number of activities related to the new data requirements, 
including the following: 



24 



16th Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 1 

ERiC 5 J 



a study to determine the feasibility of using existing databases; 



• a survey to ascertain the current status of personnel data 
collection systems in the States; 

• a series of task force meetings to help design a data collection 
format; 

• selection of a model for projecting personnel demand; and 

• a pilot test of the data collection format. 

In each of these activities, the office has included a wide variety of stakeholders. For 
example, the third and most recent task force meeting, held in September 1993, 
included State special education directors, State special education data managers, State 
Coordinators of Comprehensive Systems of Personnel Development (CSPD), advocacy 
representatives, including the National Association of State Directors of Special 
Education (NASDSE), the Council for Exceptional Children (CEC) and the American 
Speech Hearing Association (ASHA), a representative from the National Clearinghouse 
for Professions in Special Education, teacher trainers from institutions of higher 
education, representatives of various OSEP divisions, and researchers in the field of 
personnel supply and demand. 

The results of these activities indicate that State data systems are not adequate to 
accurately project estimates of personnel demand, nor are systems in place to obtain 
information on personnel supply on a State-by-State basis. A recent pilot test of the 
data collection format revealed that collecting the required data was quite burdensome 
to States and school districts and that many States could not provide all of the requisite 
data. Data that are particularly problematic for the States to report are those related 
to staff retention and attrition and to the number of unfilled, funded positions at the 
local level. OSEP plans to continue working with constituent groups to identify 
important issues and develop strategies for obtaining accurate data on personnel supply 
and demand in special education. 



SUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS 

The size of the school-age special education population continued to grow in 1992-93. 
A total of 4,633,674 students age 6 through 21 received services under Part B and 
Chapter 1 (SOP). Most of this growth can be attributed to continued increases in the 
number and percentage of students identified with specific learning disabilities. As a 
percentage of all students with disabilities, those with autism, traumatic brain injury, 
and other health impairments also increased. However, those disability categories still 
accounted for a very small percentage of the overall number of students with 
disabilities. OSEP is currently funding a small study to examine reasons for the growth 
in the number and percentage of students identified with specific learning disabilities. 
Many State and local agencies are also taking steps to control growth in the special 



16th Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 1 

ERiC ' w 



25 



education population, primarily through revisions in State funding formulas. For 
example, changes to the funding formula in Vermont have curbed the growth of the 
special education population. Eight States currently have a cap on the number of 
special education students funded as a factor in their special education funding formula 
(O'Reilly, 1993). However, the States are required to serve all eligible students. 

The data on educational placements for students with disabilities indicate that younger 
school-age students (those age 6 through 11) are more likely than their older peers to 
be placed in more integrated settings. Placement patterns also vary by disability. 
Students with speech and language impairments and with specific learning disabilities 
wort» more likely than students with other disabilities to be educated in regular class 
and resource ivuin placements. Of all students with disabilities, those with deaf- 
blindness, multiple impairments, autism, and traumatic brain injury are most likely to 
be served in mure restrictive settings, such as separate classes or schools. 

OSEP has a war Ui diange grants to State systems since 1987 to help them educate 
studenK with o jhlies, particularly those with moderate and severe disabilities, in 
general dli, ;< stings. On a statewide and national basis, the data tend to show 
only mod* -i . I .-i.es. Vieeted States are analyzing the effect of financial incentives and 
disincentive s ii SuU- funding formulas on inclusion. Several States have recently 
revised their K»» mulas to encourage less restrictive placements, and others are in the 
process u| making smukir changes. 

Tht exit d.ild slu.w thai graduation with a diploma is the most common basis of exit 
for student- w okahmties as 43.9 percent of all students leaving the system exited 
with a st.inilau! high sihool diploma. Another 13.5 percent received a certificate or 
modified diploma. I he dropout percentage has continued to decline gradually for 
students with disabilities, from 27 percent five years ago to 22 percent in 1991-92. The 
graduation rale showed a parallel increase until 1991-92, when it declined slightly. 

The decreasing percentage of students with disabilities dropping out of school is an 
encouraging trend. Beginning next year, OSEP will have more detailed information 
from States on the exit status of students 14 and older with disabilities, including data 
on the number and percentage of students returning to regular education programs. 

In school vear 1991-92, the data on personnel employed and needed to serve students 
with disabilities followed patterns similar to those shown in recent years. States 
employed 3()N,wu4 1 ] h teachers and 311,488 FTE staff other than teachers to meet the 
needs of students with disabilities. The number of teachers employed increased by 
3.8 percent from 1990-91 to 1991-92. States also reported needing an additional 27,282 
FTE teachers. Additional teacher aides, psychologists, other non-instructional staff, and 
occupational and physical therapists were also needed. 

OSEP continues to fund numerous projects designed to increase the quantity and 
improve the quality of special education personnel. One new project housed at the 
National Association of State Directors of Special Education (NASDSE) is the Network 
System for Training Education Personnel (NSTEP). The purposes of the five-year 

project are described below:

To develop, provide, and evaluate technical assistance and 
information services that will support State educational 
agencies, and their participatory planning groups, in achieving 
data-based, coordinated, comprehensive, and effective 
approaches to increasing the supply of qualified special 
educators, general educators, and related services personnel for 
the education of students with disabilities. 

To conduct activities that are relevant to specific States and 
groups of States, with the premise that implementation must 
be relevant to the diverging contexts, conditions, characteristics, 
demographics, and needs of each State, and also to the 
directions of special education and school restructuring that are 
particular to each State.

Meeting The Needs Of Infants, Toddlers, And Preschool Children With 
Disabilities 



IDEA mandates several programs that are to result in coordinated service delivery 
systems for very young children with disabilities. Programs for children from birth 
through age 5 include the Program for Infants and Toddlers with Disabilities (Part H), 
and the Preschool Grant Program (Section 619 of Part B). A variety of discretionary 
grant programs, including the Early Education Program for Children with Disabilities 
(Section 623 or Part C) also finance activities such as personnel preparation and 
research endeavors. 

The Program for Infants and Toddlers was created as Part H of IDEA by P.L. 99-457, 
the Education of the Handicapped Act Amendments of 1986. Part H requires the States 
to address the needs of infants and toddlers (children from birth through age 2) with 
disabilities and their families through a statewide comprehensive, multidisciplinary, 
interagency, coordinated program of early intervention services. The States were given 
five years to develop and implement a system. FY 1991 was the anticipated first year 
of full implementation. Although several States and Outlying Areas were able to begin 
full implementation in FY 1991, most States and Outlying Areas requested extended 
time to reach full implementation under an eligibility provision enacted in 1991. In 
1991, Part H was reauthorized as part of P.L. 102-119 for fiscal years 1992 through 1994. 

The Preschool Grant Program requires States to provide a free appropriate public 
education (FAPE) to all eligible 3- through 5-year-olds with disabilities. Federal 
requirements governing the Part B program also apply to the Preschool Grant Program. 

This chapter describes some of the important developments during FY 1992 related to 
the Part H Program, the Preschool Grant Program, and other activities supported 
through IDEA that have the goal of enhancing services to young children with 
disabilities and their families. The chapter describes issues States must contend with 
as they implement statewide systems of comprehensive early intervention and 
preschool services. Activities supported through the Early Education Program for 
Children with Disabilities and other discretionary programs are also described. 



IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PART H PROGRAM 

The original phase-in schedule for Part H, as outlined in P.L. 99-457, required that 
States provide early intervention services through a comprehensive, coordinated, 
multidisciplinary, interagency statewide system by the beginning of 1991. States were 
also required to provide assurances in two areas by 1990: first, that policies addressing 
required components of the early intervention system were in place; second, that 



16th Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 2

29 



multidisciplinary evaluations and assessments, individualized family service plans, and 
service coordination were available to all eligible infants, toddlers, and their families. 

As the deadline for applying for fourth-year funds (i.e., Fiscal Year 1990) approached, 
it became clear that a number of States were not ready to meet the fourth-year 
requirements. The only option open to these ' :ates was to drop out of the program. 
Rather than lose States from the program, Congress amended the Part H requirements. 
These amendments became law on June 6, 1991, and were applicable for Fiscal Years 
1990, 1991, and 1992 only. 

To encourage States to develop an early intervention system, Congress adopted a 
system of differential funding. Those States that were able to implement the original 
implementation schedule set for Part H in P.L. 99-457 received larger grants than States 
that had not completed either fourth- or fifth-year requirements. States experiencing 
significant hardships in meeting the requirements of the fourth or fifth year of 
participation were eligible to receive up to two extended participation grants. An 
extended participation grant is equal to the State's grant award from the previous year. 
As an example, an extended participation grant for FY 1990 was an amount equal to 
the State's FY 1989 payment. Ten States and one Outlying Area requested extended 
participation for FY 1990. These entities provided assurances that they met the 
requirements for third-year participation in the Part H program and ' ' tted a 
request from the Governor specifying the hardships experienced by the Stat ^ meeting 
the fourth- or fifth-year Part H requirements, including a plan for meeting these 
requirements. 



Participation Status 

There was a significant increase in the number of States moving into fifth year full 
implementation with FY 1992 funds (for use in FY 1993). As of July 1, 1992, 18 States 
and jurisdictions were in full implementation status. By September 30, 1993 (the close 
of the FY 1992 award period) a total of 41 Stages and jurisdictions had been awarded 
grants for full implementation of Part H. The States designated as having EP(2) status 
received awards for a second year of extended participation. No further extensions are 
authorized. One State did not apply for a Part H grant during the year in which 
FY 1992 funds were awarded. The complete Part H implementation status list as of the 
close of the award of FY 1992 funds is contained in table 2.1. 

The list of State lead agencies is in table 2.2. All lead agencies in 1992 were the same 
as in 1991, except that in New Jersey and Florida the lead agency changed from 
education to health. Nineteen States, including two with joint lead agencies, have 
assigned their education agency to be the Part H lead agency. Twenty-two have 
assigned their health agency, and the remainder have assigned another agency. Texas 
and Maine are the only States that have designated the State Interagency Coordinating 
Council lead to be the lead agency.

Congress appropriated $175 million in Part H funds for the States in FY 1992 and $213.3 
million in FY 1993. Funding for Part H increased 82 percent in FY 1993 over FY 1991, 
when it was $117.1 million. The system of differential funding based on a State's 
implementation status continued through the completion of the award of FY 1992 
funds. At the end of the fiscal year, States that entered or continued in full 
implementation status received a reallotment of funds that represented an increase over 
their original grant award. The reallotment amounted to nearly $18 million that would 
have been available to extended participation States and Mississippi, had they been in 
full implementation. Each extended participation State received an allotment equal to 
what the State had received in FY 1990 but no less than $500,000. Reallotments ranged 
from $109,684, awarded to each of the 12 minimum allocation States, to $2,783,391, 
awarded to California. Table 2.3 contains a list of State base awards, reallotments, and 
participation status. 



Changes to the Part H Program 

The final regulations amending the implementing regulations for Part H were published 
in the Federal Register on July 30, 1993. The regulations incorporated the major 
provisions of the 1991 statutory amendments and responded to parents, advocates, and 
providers concerns by updating and clarifying the rules for the Part H program. Public 
comment on the proposed regulations was solicited through the Federal Register on 
May 1, 1992, and a total of 173 comments were received. Most comments addressed 
the following areas:

challenge a parent's refusal to consent to the child's initial 
evaluation; and 

clarifying complaint procedures among public agencies and the 
lead agency. 



The Federal Interagency Coordinating Council (FICC) 

The FICC was created shortly after implementation of P.L. 99-457 as a forum that could 
mirror, at the Federal level, the multiagency mobilization function that Congress had 
mandated for the States. At that time, the FICC was not mandated by law. However, 
the 1991 Amendments required that the FICC be established and include a broad range 
of Federal agencies involved with policies, programs, and services to infants and 
toddlers with disabilities and their families and to preschool children with disabilities. 

The new FICC's mission was outlined in the 1991 Amendments and is summarized 
below: 

• to minimize duplication of programs and activities relating to 
early intervention services for infants and toddlers with 
disabilities and their families, and preschool services for 
children with disabilities, across Federal, State, and local 
agencies; 

• to ensure the effective coordination of Federal early 
intervention and preschool programs and policies across 
Federal agencies; 



16m Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 2 ^ „ 

i 1 



• coordinate the provision of Federal technical assistance and 
support activities to States; 

• to identify gaps in Federal agency programs and services; and 

• to identify barriers to Federal interagency cooperation. 

An Interagency Agreement among participating Federal agencies, signed on August 12, 
1992, endorsed a system of early intervention services that are family-centered and 
community-based, occur in integrated and accessible environments, and feature 
interagency coordination. The agreement emphasizes support for interagency 
evaluation and assessment as well as the provision of technical assistance to enhance 
early evaluation and intervention. Current FICC membership is shown in table 2.4. 

The new FICC met for the first time on August 4, 1993. Council members suggested 
substantive issues that the FICC should address, such as broadening the FICC's focus 
on families; analyzing the needs of families with children with disabilities; advocating 
development of comprehensive service systems rather than separate services and 
programs; and avoiding interagency conflict. The Council appointed three 
subcommittees: a family rights task force, a communication subcommittee, and an 
integration and continuity of services subcommittee. 

The FICC meets quarterly for one and a half days. In that time, subcommittee meetings 
are held for two half days, and the full Council meets for half a day. Meeting dates are 
announced annually in the Federal Register. The meetings are open to the. public. 



Data from the States on the Part H Program 

OSEP collects five categories of information about infants and toddlers receiving early 
intervention services: the number served, the number awaiting service, the services 
received, personnel employed and needed, and the setting in which services are 
provided. Because the States are at various stages of implementation, not all of them 
are yet able to report complete and accurate information. 



Number of Infants and Toddlers Being Served 

To determine the number of infants and toddlers receiving early intervention services, 
OSEP collected data from the States on infants and toddlers served under Chapter 1 
(SOP) on December 1, 1992. States are also required to submit an unduplicated count 
of all other children receiving early intervention services. 

As shown, in table 2.5, States and Outlying Areas reported to OSEP that on December 1, 
1992, they were serving 76,449 infants and toddlers with disabilities under Chapter 1 
(SOP), an increase of 9,954 (or 15 percent) over the previous year. Most States reported 
an increase in the number of children served in FY 1993. Eight reported no change,

and 6 reported decreases. Although there were exceptions, most of the changes in the 
number of children served under the Chapter 1 (SOP) count were not substantial. The 
only State reporting a notable decline in the number of children se rved was Tennessee 
(1,956 in 1992 versus 2,296 in 1991). Only six States reported a relatively significant 
increase: Illinois ;4,578 in 1992 versus 3,560 in 1991); Massachusetts (6,484 in 1992, up

from 5,549 in 1991); New York (3,730 in 1992 versus 2,298 in 1991); Oklahoma (1,216 in 
1992, up from 659 in 1991); Oregon (1,322 in 1992 versus 821 in 1991); and Wisconsin 
(2,167 in 1992 versus 1,433 in 1991). 

It is important to recognize that the increase in numbers of children served under 
Chapter 1 (SOP) does not necessarily mean an increase in the absolute number of 
infants and toddlers with disabilities served. Instead, the increase may reflect the 
States' increasing desire to use this funding source to serve these children. States may 
now also be able to provide more accurate counts of the actual number of children with 
disabilities as their early intervention systems evolve. 

Table 2.5 contains data on the number of children served under Chapter 1 (SOP), other 
programs, from birth through age 2, and the percentage of population the birth through 
age 2 population represents. The data indicate that of the 54 jurisdictions reporting, 29 
experienced an increase in children from birth through age 2 enrolled in programs other 
than Chapter 1 (SOP), 13 reported a decline, and 12 were unchanged. Two States, 
California and Florida, reported dramatic declines in numbers of children in programs 
other than Chapter 1 (SOP). California reported 24,177 children enrolled in such 
programs on December 1, 1991, and 10,943 in 1992 - a decline of 13,234 children. 
Florida reported a change from 31,322 to 3,055 from 1991 to 1992, a decline of 28,267. 
The combined decline in these two States (41,501) offset the growth in the 29 
jurisdictions that did experience increases. Thus, the national change between 1991 and 
1992 in programs other than Chapter 1 (SOP) was a decline of 38,235 children. 

As more States move into full compliance, greater uniformity in definitions of eligible 
children, in data collection methodology, and reporting will likely result. Analysis of 
child counts increasingly reflect a State's unduplicated Part H population. Changes in 
child counts from one year to the next will more accurately reflect the changes in 
Part H enrollment, rather than changes in enrollment in programs that may have far 
broader eligibility parameters than Part H. For example, the decline in the child count 
in programs other than Chapter 1 (SOP) in both California and Florida is due to the fact 
that both States included infants and toddlers enrolled in non-mandated at-risk 
programs in their 1991 counts but not in their 1992 counts, when both of these States 
fully implemented Part H. 

Although States continue to report that data collection methodology is improving and 
that the December 1 child count is an increasingly accurate measure of children 
receiving services on that particular day, it is important to remember that the 
December 1 count is merely a snapshot in time. States serve more children in the 
course of a year than they do on any particular day. Therefore, it is crucial to recognize 
that the annual December 1 child count results are probably smaller than the total 
number of children and families who have received early intervention services during 
the year.

Services and Settings 



Data on the location of services were provided by 43 jurisdictions, but are generally 
incomplete. General statements about national trends or changes in the location of 
services cannot be made. But the data that do exist are consistent with previous reports 
that the home remains the most frequent service site. Thirty-four percent of services 
are delivered in the home. The next most frequent service settings are the early 
intervention classroom (33 percent) and the outpatient center (29 percent). As a service 
setting, the home declined from 41 percent of all settings and the outpatient center 
increased from 13 percent from 1991 to 1992. However, the status of States' data 
collection for this component makes it unwise to suggest any changes or trends. 

State reports on the types of services that children received under the Part H system 
are also incomplete (see table 2.6). Some States report that this information is an 
accurate description of services, but others cannot. Special instruction remains the most 
frequently reported service, followed by speech/language pathology, social work, 
occupational therapy, and physical therapy. 



Part H Implementation Issues 

States continue to experience uneven progress as they attempt to implement all Part H 
components. While some of the impediments to effective implementation are State- 
specific, there are common themes that continue to be reported to OSEP through the 
annual Part H application process and through surveys and informal discussions with 
families and State Part H personnel. 

A report recently completed by the Carolina Policy Studies Program (CPSP) at the 
University of North Carolina provided important information about State efforts to 
implement Part H. OSEP provided support for CPSP's analysis of State Part H policy 
formulation and implementation issues. 

CPSP reported seveval major barriers that slowed State progress in Part H 
implementation, including the volume of policy decisions, the challenging fiscal 
situation confronted by the States, and a lack of direct authority or power by the lead 
agency, which resulted in time-consuming negotiations and compromise to achieve 
consensus with other stakeholders. 

Fragmentation, duplication, and overlap in services - initially identified soon after 
enactment of P.L. 99-457 as barriers to the development of a coordinated, interagency 
system - continue to be pronounced. A 50-State survey completed in 1992 by CPSP 
indicated that as many as 44 sources of funding were found in all the States. So many 
sources impedes development of efficient funding mechanisms. CPSP discovered that 
25 laws and programs addressed, in some fashion, the same target population. Thus, 
policymakers face difficulty in establishing eligibility, predicting the range of needed 
services, estimating costs for such services, and identifying the appropriate children to 
provide intervention. These difficulties have contributed to the States' reluctance to

add the at-risk population to the group of eligible children, because the service and 
fiscal implications remain too uncertain. 

According to the CPSP report, the chronic shortage of early intervention service 
personnel - particularly in the disciplines of physical therapy, occupational therapy, 
and speech/language pathology — was universally viewed as a serious problem. 
Clarification of the health services' role in the Part H system, defining a common vision 
for the service coordinator role, and greater emphasis on interdisciplinary training were 
also identified as significant issues. 

CPSP was impressed by the States' progress toward Part H implementation, but 
remained concerned about the system's ability to deliver the variety of needed services 
in a manner consistent with the Part H vision. CPSP recommended that the role of 
medical assistance in financing services be strengthened by automatically making 
infants and toddlers in the Part H system eligible for medical assistance, regardless of 
family income. 

A study by the National Early Childhood Technical Assistance System (NECTAS) 
(Perry, 1993) underscored how hard it is to calculate per child and aggregate costs of 
Part H services. Many factors complicate the task of projecting costs, such as State 
eligibility definitions, estimating Part H population size, overlap with existing State and 
local fiscal commitment to early intervention services, participation rates, location of 
services, and the range of services that may be needed by a child or family. The four 
States that had already completed cost studies and that were featured in the NECTAS 
study — California, Florida, Maryland, and Virginia — reported per child costs for 
children with developmental delays (not for children classified as at-risk) ranging from 
$4,312 (Virginia) to $6,090 (Maryland). 

But the range of per child costs is best illustrated by a detailed analysis in the California 
study, which attempted to provide cost figures for children with fairly specific 
developmental profiles. Annual costs ranged from $659 for a child with mild speech 
delays of unknown etiology discovered at 18 months of age, to $15,060 for a child of 
between 2 and 3 years who had been identified at 6 months of age with severe cerebral 
palsy and who also had motor functioning, feeding, and speech impairments. 

In September 1993, NECTAS issued a report (NEC*TAS, 1993) summarizing the topics 
addressed at the annual National Partnerships for Progress Conference, held in 
Arlington, Virginia, in August 1993. Issues remaining at the forefront of discussion in 
the early intervention community include: 

• use of assistive services; 

• the maimer in which services are provided to the at-risk 
population; 

• the role of medical and health services; 

• transition from Part II to Part B,

• cultural diversity; and 



• personnel preparation and shortages. 



IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRESCHOOL GRANT PROGRAM 

FY 1992 was the first year all States were required to provide a free appropriate public 
education (FAPE) for all 3- through 5-year-old children with disabilities. States are 
awarded funds under the Preschool Grant Program based on the December 1 child 
count of the previous year for children from age 3 through 5 years who are receiving 
special education and related services. Approximately $325.8 million was appropriated 
in FY 1993, nearly $6 million more than in FY 1992. However, the number of 
preschoolers rose to 441,748 from the previous year's figure of 398,757, so the $6 million 
gain was offset by the increase in the number of children. Thus, the per child allocation 
under the Preschool Grant Program was $738, down from $804 in the previous year. 
The per child award from Part B was $411, meaning that each State received 
approximately $1,149 under IDEA for every preschooler receiving special education and 
related services as of the previous December 1 child count. Table 2.7 provides a State- 
by-State breakdown of preschool grant awards. 



Regulatory Changes to the Program 

The final regulations to Part B, as amended to implement the Handicapped Program 
Technical Amendments of 1988, the Education of the Handicapped Act Amendments 
of 1990 and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1991, were 
published in the Federal Register on September 29, 1992. Changes germane to 
preschool special education services include the following: 

• authority for States to use "developmentally delayed" for 
preschoolers in a State's definition of "children with 
disabilities;" 

• a requirement that States develop policies and procedures for 
smooth transition between Part H and the Preschool Grant 
Program; 

• authority for States to use IFSPs for the preschool special 
education population; and 

• authority for States to use Preschool Grant Program funds to 
provide FAPE to 2-year-oids who will reach age 3 during the 
school year. These changes reflect the Federal commitment to 
promote a seamless system of services for children from birth

through age 5. Inclusion of the term "developmentally 
delayed" provides States more options as they consider 
eligibility criteria for preschoolers. 

NEC*TAS publishes an annual analysis of preschool services entitled "The Section 619 
Profile." The June 1993 volume reported that States and Outlying Areas use one of four 
methods to determine the eligibility of preschoolers for special education: 

• Nine use only Part B disability categories. 

• Nineteen States use Part B categories and a preschool-specific 
category/ classification. 

• Fourteen use some, but not all, Part B categories and a 
preschool-specific category that replaces the omitted Part B 
categories. 

• Nine use only a preschool-specific or noncategorical criterion 
and do not use any Part B categories for preschoolers. 
NEC*TAS also reported that 23 States are using or are 
considering the use of IFSPs for preschool services. Of the 23 
States, 2 use IFSPs as a statewide policy for all preschool 
services; 14 States allow local discretion; and 7 are collecting 
data for future decision making. 



Number of Preschoolers Served 

The total Preschool Grant Program and Chapter 1 (SOP) child counts indicate that 
460,119 preschool children received special education and related services during school 
v-jar 1992-93, an increase of 37,893, or 9 percent, over the number served in 1991-92, 
continuing the trend toward annual increases noted in last year's annual report to 
Congress. Figure 2.1 shows the number of children from 3 through 5 years of age 
served under the Preschool Grant Program and Chapter 1 (SOP) from 1987-88 through 
the 1992-93 school year. 

Of the total number of preschoolers served, 441,748 (96 percent) were counted under 
IDEA and the remaining 18,371 were counted by States under Chapter 1 (SOP). The 
trend toward an increase in children reported under the Preschool Grant Program and 
a substantial decrease in children reported under Chapter 1 (SOP) continues. The 
Preschool Grant Program 1991-92 to 1992-93 increase was 42,991 (10.8 percent); the 
Chapter 1 (SOP) 1991-92 to 1992-93 decrease was 5,098 (21.7 percent). 

Table 2.8 reports the number of children age 3 through 5 receiving special education 
and related services by State. It also reports the percentage of the total population of 
3- through 5-year-olds receiving special education and related services in each State. 
Total incidence in the national population is 4.07 percent. States with more than 6.0 
percent of their population receiving these services are Kentucky (8.27 percent),

South Dakota (6.83 percent), and Wyoming (6.52 percent). States with less than 3.5 
percent of the population receiving services are Hawaii (1.83 percent), District of 
Columbia (2.10 percent), Missouri (2.75 percent), California (3.11 percent), Texas (3.19 
percent), Arizona (3.27 percent), Georgia (3.31 percent), Florida (3.37 percent), Ohio 
(3.38 percent), New Hampshire (3.43 percent), and Colorado (3.45 percent). 

The percentage of children receiving preschool special education services does not 
necessarily correlate with the percentage of children from birth through age 2 receiving 
Part H services. For example, Kentucky provided Preschool Grant Program services to 
8.27 percent of its age 3 through 5 population, and South Dakota, 6.83 percent. But 
they provided Part H services to less than 1 percent of their birth through age 2 
populations. Kentucky provided Part H services to .61 percent of its from birth through 
age 2 population, and South Dakota, .8 percent (see table 2.5).

Interestingly, Hawaii had both the highest birth through age 2 percentage (5.64 percent) 
and the lowest percentage under the Preschool Grant Program (1.83 percent). This may 
be due to Hawaii's liberal definition of Part H eligibility, which not only includes 
children who are at-risk for developmental delays, but also includes children who are 
at-risk environmentally. At age 3, a majority of Part H children in Hawaii move to 
Head Start or community preschools rather than to Part B programs;. 

Of the remaining 10 States reporting the lowest preschool special education enrollment 
percentages, five States had less than 1 percent of their children receiving birth to age 
3 services, and five reported that between 1 and 3 percent of their children were 
receiving birth to age 3 services. 

The trend toward an increase m the percentage of younger preschoolers receiving 
Preschool Grant Program services continued in FY 1993. The number of 3-year-olds 
increased by more than 13,000, or 19 percent over the previous year. The number of 
4-year-olds increased by about 20,000, or 15.8 percent over the previous year. The 
number of 5-year-olds experienced the smallest change, increasing only by about 9,500, 
or 47 percent, over the previous year. As noted in figure 2.2, in school year 1992-93 
the 3- and 4-year-old Preschool Grant Program population made up half of the

preschoolers receiving special education services. This figure is up slightly from the 49 
percent reported in school year 1991-92 and is a significant increase over the .36 percent 
reported in 1986-87. This information supports what has been informally reported by 
the States - that the implementation of Part H and transition to Part B has resulted in 
ever earlier identification of children with disabilities. Further, States have placed more 
emphasis on including preschoolers in Child Find, because IDEA now requires them 
to provide programs, rather than allowing States to serve preschoolers at their 
discretion.

implementation Issues Related to the Preschool Grant Program 

Implementing high quality, effective programs for children with disabilities from age 
3 through 5 years remains challenging. Implementation requires synthesis of a variety 
of funding streams, calls for coordination with the Part H system to promote the goal 
of a seamless system for children from birth through age 5, and requires that services 




inual Report To Congress: Chapter 2 55 



must both be developmentally appropriate and be implemented in the least restrictive 
environment. This section discusses important developments in these areas. 

Administering the Preschool Grant Program 

The National Early Childhood Technical Assistance System (NEC*TAS) publishes an 
annual profile about the Preschool Grant Program (NEC*TAS, 1993) that provides 
information enabling comparisons to be made about how States and Outlying Areas are 
implementing a variety of components of the Preschool Grant Program. Of the 57 
States and entities reporting, 47 administer preschool special education programs 
through the Sper?! Education Unit of the State educational agency (SEA). Among the 
other ten States, six are administered within the Early Childhood Unit, three split 
responsibility between special education and preschool units, and one State (Minnesota) 
shares responsibility among community collaboration, instructional strategies, and fiscal 
application units. 

Five percent of Preschool Grant Program funding may be set aside for administration. 
. Fifty- three of the 57 States or entities reported how this funding is used. Forty-three 
SEAs use the full 5 percent, two use 4 percent, four use between 2 and 3 percent, and 
four use none. 

Another 20 percent of the Preschool Grant Program funding may be set aside for the 
planning and development of a statewide comprehensive service delivery system for 
children with disabilities from birth through age five years; the provision of direct and 
support services for children with disabilities aged three through five years; and at the 
State's discretion, the provision of a free appropriate public education to two-year-old 
children with disabilities who will reach age three during the school year. Fifty-four 
of the 57 States or entities reported how this funding is used. Thirty-one SEAs use the 
full 20 percent, eight use between 15 percent and 19 percent, four use 10 percent to 14 
percent, four use 1 to 9 percent, and seven use none. These funds are most often used 
for training and technical assistance. About half the States use this funding for pilot 
programs, materials, planning/coordination, and direct service. 

Thirty-five States reported using 17 funding sources to finance preschool special 
education services, in addition to the Part B and Preschool Grant Program funds that 
all the States used. The most commonly used funds are State special education (32 
States), local funding (30 States), Chapter 1 (SOP) (28 States), Federal Head Start (24 
States), and Comprehensive Child Development (24 States) funds. Eleven States have 
developed a process for projecting or determining the full costs associated with 
preschool special education services. Of these 11 States, eight (Arkansas, Arizona, Iowa, 
Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Ohio, and Pennsylvania) are prepared to disseminate this 
information to interested persons. Eighteen States have developed a process for 
forecasting the prevalence and/or types of disabilities anticipated for preschoolers with 
disabilities. Of these States, twelve (Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, 
Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, and Texas) are prepared to 
disseminate this information to interested persons. 



56 16m Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 2 



Coordinating Part H and Preschool Programs 

Many States acknowledge the importance of ensuring a coordinated system for children 
from birth through age 5 by creating formal linkages between the Part H and Preschool 
Grant Program systems. According to NECTAS, the focus of the ICCs in 42 of the 57 
States or entities reporting is from birth through age 2. In 15 States the ICC focus is on 
birth through age 5. States are required to include a SEA representative on the State- 
level ICC. The most typical representatives from the SEA are the Coordinator of Early 
Childhood /Special Education (16 States), the Director of Special Education (14 States), 
or the Section Chief for Special Education (13 States). 

The majority of States have developed or are developing policies, transition agreements, 
or both, governing the transition from Part H to preschool. Twenty-three States have 
policies in place, three more than last year. Eighteen States are developing policies, one 
more than last year. Of the 49 States reporting in this area, 23 indicated they are using 
or considering using the IFSP for preschool services. Two States (Oregon and Maine) 
use IFSPs on a statewide basis for all preschool services. Fourteen States allow local 
discretion, and seven States are collecting data for future decision making. 

Twenty-nine States report that public awareness efforts are directed toward the birth 
through age 5 population rather than the birth through age 2 and age 3 through 5 
populations. Ten States have added birth through age 5 certifications to their special 
education certification processes. 



Providing Preschool Services in the Least Restrictive Environment 

Providing special education services in the least restrictive environment (LRE) has 
become a central national issue, and will remain so for years to come. Researchers and 
policymakers are contending with the important goal of ensuring that special education 
and related services are individualized to meet the unique needs of each child while 
also ensuring that such services are delivered in settings that enable children to interact 
with nondisabled peers. The difficulty of meeting this goal for the preschool 
population is exacerbated by several factors. A main barrier to successful 
implementation is that many LEAs do not operate preschool programs at all, and 
preschool is not available for any children without disabilities. While there are a 
variety of public programs for 4-year-olds, the issue is particularly problematic for 3- 
year-olds. 

Placing children with disabilities in settings that enable them to interact wi* their 
nondisabled peers may require strengthening traditional alliances with such programs 
as Head Start, and require creating new alliances with the child care and private 
nursery school communities, as well as other community-based programs. Such actions 
can raise a host of new issues, such as those listed below: 

• application of SEA policies and procedures to private settings 

that may not be accredited by the SEA; 




\$th Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 2 



57 



• the role of the public school special educator in the private 
setting; 

• determination of payment for special education versus child 
care services; and 

• the implementation of Part B requirements in settings that are 
unaccustomed to Part B policies and procedures. 

The data on preschool placements do not offer sufficiently specific information to 
determine whether services are being offered in inclusive settings. One reason is that 
the categories used for the school-age population have limited relevance to preschool 
settings. Preschool-aged children are frequently served in community-based settings 
rather than in public schools. Although States report that almost half of all preschool 
children are served in regular classes, the definition of a regular class for a preschooler 
receiving Preschool Grant Program services is likely to be considerably different than 
for a regular class for a school-age child receiving Part B services. OSEP has developed 
a "crosswalk" for reporting preschoolers in existing OSEP placement categories. The 
crosswalk provides specific instructions that apply to 3-, 4-, and 5-year-old children 
with disabilities. 

Preschool special educators pointed out to OSEP that the placement categories used for 
6- through 21-year-olds are not appropriate for preschoolers and made preschool 
placements appear more restrictive than they actually are. Reasons for this mismatch 
include lack of publicly-funded general education programs for 3- and 4-year-olds, 
provision of special education services in child care centers, Head Start centers, and 
other types of facilities, and use of home-based programs to provide preschool special 
education services. As a result, OSEP has been developing an alternative format for 
collecting preschool placement data. The proposed categories are as follows: 

• early childhood setting; 

• combined early childhood/early childhood special education 
setting; 

• early childhood special education setting; 

• home; 

• residential setting; and 

• in-patient hospital setting. 

OSEP is soliciting input from SEA personnel concerning the advantages and 
disadvantages of these data collection categories. The "crosswalk" will be used until 
preschool-specific categories can be defined to accurately reflect service delivery models, 
as well as be compatible with State data collection capacities. 




58 



16th Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 2 



NEC*TAS (1993) reports that policies, missions, or philosophies promoting an inclusion 
philosophy have been or are being developed by 31 SEAs. Thirty-five SEAs have 
developed or are developing policies or guidelines specifically addressing LRE for the 
preschool population. Thirty-one SEAs have developed or are developing policies 
regarding the funding of placements in other than regular elementary schools. Thirty- 
seven SEAs have checklists, questionnaires, or other data collection tools in use or 
under development to monitor provision of LRE preschool services. 

A significant relationship between the Preschool Grant Program and Head Start was 
created upon publication in the January 21, 1993 Federal Register of the Head Start 
Program Performance Standards on Services for Children with Disabilities (45 CFR Part 
1308). An important component of those regulations is a requirement that a disabilities 
services plan be created to meet the special needs of children with disabilities and their 
parents. The regulations stress the joint responsibility of Head Start and the LEA to 
ensure that services are provided in a coordinated manner that both meets the child's 
needs and ensures that services are occurring in the LRE. Head Start programs must 
have a continuum of service options, which include the following: 

• joint placement of children with other agencies; 

• shared provision of services with other agencies; 

• shared personnel to supervise special education services, when 
necessary to meet State personnel qualifications; 

• administrative accommodations, such as having two children 
share one enrollment slot when each child's IEP calls for part- 
time service because of his or her individual needs; and 

• any other strategies to ensure that special needs are met, such 
as staff increases, use of volunteers, use of supervised students 
in such fields as child development, special education, and 
child psychology, and various therapists and family services to 
assist staff. 

The regulations and the guidance material in the appendix to Part 1308 stress the 
collaborative opportunities ivailable to the LEA and Head Start agency, as well as 
describing each entity's responsibilities in detail. 

The continued implementation of the Americans with Disabilities Act will further 
increase the opportunities for inclusion in the child care sector. Greater awareness of 
the legal prohibitions against barriers to participation will help increase inclusive 
preschool placement options. 

Since 1989, OSEP has funded an Early Childhood Research Institute on Integration, 
which is operated by the Allegheny-Singer Research Institute (recently transferred to 
St. Peter's Child Development Centers) and the Univorsity of Washington. The Institute 
is examining a variety of programmatic, curric r, and policy issues related to

ERIC 



preschool mainstreaming. During the past year or so, the Institute researchers have 
written several articles that analyze data from recent research endeavors. Major 
findings are reported below. 

Wolery et al. (in press) conducted three studies on various factors involved in preschool 
mainstreaming. In one study, 75 percent of the responding preschool programs 
indicated that a child with a disability was enrolled. Speech and language impairments 
were the most frequently cited disability. Head Start programs were the setting in 
which mainstreaming was most likely to occur. 

Another study by Wolery et al. (1992) described benefits and barriers to preschool 
mainstreaming. The chief benefits are the opportunity for children to be exposed to 
those who are different and the opportunity for children with special needs to have 
normalized social experiences. Barriers include troublesome areas such as child-staff 
ratios that may be too high to allow staff members to adequately deal with children 
with disabilities, architectural barriers that affect children with orthopedic disabilities, 
and lack of related services personnel in mainstreamed preschool settings. 

Miller et al. (1992) compared the results of mainstreaming for preschool children with 
and without disabilities. They found that mainstreamed children with developmental 
delays engaged in a significantly higher rate of interaction than did their counterparts 
in specialized settings. They also found that the directly observed social behaviors of 
children without disabilities in mainstreamed settings did not differ from those of their 
counterparts in "typical-children-only" settings, although teachers felt children without 
disabilities benefitted socially from their interactions with a variety of children. Parents 
of children with disabilities rated the social and related skills of their mainstreamed 
children significantly better than did parents of similar children in specialized settings. 

OSEP is funding a number of demonstration projects that are developing models for 
providing early intervention services, or training providers for early intervention in 
inclusive settings. Among the projects are the following: 

• Project GAINS (Gaining Access /Integrating Needed Services) 
in Newton, Massachusetts. The purpose of the project is to 
enhance the ability of child care programs nationwide to offer 
quality, integrated services for young children with disabilities 
by creating a replicable program model. Programs are 
designed through a local planning process that includes 
representatives of a variety of sectors of the community. Staff 
development and training are provided to parents and 
providers, with an emphasis on in-service workshops, training 
in classroom adaptation, and creation of a resource support 
network of specialists to coach teachers in inclusive settings. 

• Successful Integration of Infants and Toddlers with Disabilities 
through Multidisciplinary Training in Hampton, New 
Hampshire. The purpose of the project is to develop in-service 
training materials that will prepare professionals and caregivers 



60 16m Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 2 



to provide and coordinate child care services for infants and 
toddlers with disabilities. Specific training modules have been 
developed in 10 basic competency areas, and individual 
training /demonstration is provided for child-specific issues. 
Self-directed training video and print modules and a 
guidebook on mains treaming infants and toddlers with 
disabilities have been devised. 

• Research Institute on Preschool Mainstreaming of the St. Peter's 
Child Development Centers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The 
purpose of the project is to address the challenges and barriers 
to preschool inclusive services, including: policy voids and 
disincentives to inclusion, lack of information on key issues, 
lack of clear guidelines for adapting existing curricula, and lack 
of awareness by regular and special educators regarding the 
feasibility of inclusion. 

• Integrated Outreach Project at Utah State University in Logan, 
Utah. The purpose of the project is to provide training and 
technical assistance to early intervention personnel so they may 
provide services to young children with disabilities in the least 
restrictive environment. Components of training include 
social integration, functional mainstreaming for success, a 
preschool transition project, and a multiagency project for 
preschoolers. 

• Project Coach Outreach: Transdisciplinary Consultation/ 
Coaching Trakrng for Implementing Integrated Model 
Programs at the University of Southern Mississippi in 
Hattiesburg, Mississippi. The purpose of the project is to 
promote collaborative, transdisciplinary consultation and 
coaching practices by local agency teams in order to place 
young children between 3 and 5 years of age with moderate to 
severe disabilities into least restrictive environment, 
community-based early childhood programs in Mississippi. 

Transition: Part H to Preschool Grant Program 

Flexible and effective transition policies have been cited as crucial to development of 
a coordinated system for children and families moving from early intervention to 
preschool programs. Transition systems are needed to ensure that services are not 
interrupted as families move from one system to another. 



16th Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 2 61 



OSEP issued an April 1, 1993 memorandum guiding preschool and Part H policymakers 
responsible for policies and procedures governing the transition from Part H to the 
Preschool Grant Program. The memorandum emphasized that States must ensure that 
transition policies and procedures address the following issues: 

• how families will be included in the transition process; 

• how the lead agency will notify the appropriate local 
educational agency (LEA) or intermediate educational unit 
(IEU) in which the child resides about the child; and 

• how the lead agency will convene, with the approval of the 
family, a conference between the lead agency, the family, and 
the appropriate LEA or IEU, at least 90 days before either the 
child's third birthday or, if earlier, the date on which the child 
is eligible for the preschool program under the Preschool Grant 
Program in accordance with State law. 

The memorandum provides guidance to States regarding the delivery of FAPE for 
children prior to their third birthday, as well as the use of Part H funds for children 
turning 3 during the summer before the beginning of the school year. The 
memorandum emphasized both the overlap between the Part H and the Preschool 
Grant Program systems and the need to ensure that the distinct requirements of each 
system are included in State policies and procedures. Policies must be adopted that 
address the following: 

• During the transition process from Part H to the Preschool 
Grant Program, States must ensure that the prior notification 
and parental consent requirements of the Part B system are 
adhered to and that parents have been provided with 
procedural safeguards under Part B. 

• For children turning 3 during the summer, the IEP or IFSP 
must specify how the children will receive FAPE as of their 
third birthday. It must also include a process to ensure that 
extended school-year services (ESY) have been considered as 
part of the child's Part B service plan. 

• States are permitted to use an IFSP for children until their sixth 
birthday. However, when FAPE is provided to a preschooler 
through an IFSP, the rights and protections of the Part B 
system apply to that child. 

• The State Part H and Part B systems must have overlapping 
Child Find requirements. The Part H Child Find system must 
ensure that policies and procedures for a comprehensive Child 
Find system are consistent with Part B. Yet the Part H 
agency's participation in Child Find activities does not alter the 



16th Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 2 ^ ^ 



SEA's role in ensuring compliance with the Child Find 
requirements for the birth through age 2 population. 

• Transition training can be included in the Part H 
Comprehensive System of Personnel Development (CSPD). 

• The State Interagency Coordinating Council (SICC) must 
include a representative from the SEA who is engaged in 
policy development and implementation for Preschool Grant 
Program services. The role of the SICC has been expanded to 
enable the Council to advise and assist the SEA regarding 
transition. The SICC may now also work with the SEA to 
provide services to children with disabilities from birth through 
age 5. 

The 1991 IDEA amendments allow States to use Part H and Preschool Grant Program 
funds during transition periods. Part H funds may be used to provide FAPE to 
children, in accordance with Part B, from their third birthday until the beginning of the 
new school year. Preschool Grant funds may be used to provide FAPE to children with 
disabilities who are 2 years old and who will reach their third birthday during the 
course of the school year. 

Recognizing the importance of transition for children and families, OSEP has supported 
a variety of research initiatives on the topic of transition. Among these is the Kansas 
Early Childhood Research Institute (KECRI), which began work in 1988 and publishes 
a quarterly newsletter. The institute subscribes to an "ecocultural niche model" of 
transition, which views a child as a member of a family that is part of a broader social 
and cultural community. Extending this concept to transition, KECRI defines 
components of a transition framework as follows: 

• transition is a change in a child's and family's ecocultural 
niche, instigated by a change in service providers; 

• transitions are difficult because they require accommodations 
in daily routines for everyone involved; 

• a transition's impact depends on the number of 
accommodations required; 

• one measure of a transition intervention's success is how far it 
encourages sustainable accommodations; 

• a family's accommodations in transitions are not necessarily 
negative; 

• valences for accommodations to transitions ~ the positive or 
negative weightings - are not known a priori; 




J6w Annual Report To Congress; Chapter 2 63 

iu.j 



• interventions to reduce negative transition impact may involve 
both distal (e.g., financial policy) and proximal (e.g., obtaining 
transportation or household help) features of a family's 
ecocultural niche; and 

• service providers occupy an ecocultural niche that influences 
the nature, timing, and quality of their efforts. 

A variety of projects and informational activities have been supported by KECRI, such 
as: 

• "parental adjustment to the birth of a child with disabilities and 
early hospital transitions/' a parent-to-parent videotape; 

• planning the transition from the neonatal intensive care unit 
(NICU) to the home; 

• in-home intervention to facilitate the transition from the NICU 
to the home; 

• programming a successful transition from home to preschool: 
developing individualized treatment programs to teach 
appropriate social skills; 

• transition of preschool children with severe and multiple 
disabilities from nonintegrated to community-based preschool 
programs; 

• verbal interactive skills training for transitions; 

• transfer of academic and classroom procedures and skills from 
preschool to home and from kindergarten to home; 

• programming successful classroom transition: assessment of 
children's survival skills and classroom requirements; 

• promoting successful transition to the primary grades: 
prediction of reading problems for children with speech and 
language impairments; 

• assessing concerns of families in transition and promoting 
family-directed problem solving; and 

• role of the professional in successful transition. 



16m Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 2 



OSEP is sponsoring several demonstration projects to foster the development of best 
practices in transition. They include the following: 

• Project STEPS (Sequenced Transitions to Education in the 
Public Schools) at the Child Development Center of the 
Bluegrass, Inc., in Lexington, Kentucky. The purpose of the 
project is to provide training and technical assistance to help 
State agencies develop statev/id<* transition systems for 
children, from birth to age 8, with disabilities. The STEPS 
model focuses on policy and procedure development in 
administration, staff, and family involvement in the transition 
process, as well as child preparation for the next environment. 

• Bridging Early Services Transition Project at the Associated 
Colleges of Central Kansas in McPherson, Kansas. The 
purpose of the project is to help administrators, service 
providers, and families plan and coordinate transition for 
young children with disabilities or developmental delays. The 
model is being replicated in more than 15 States with both 
rural and urban populations. The needs of each State, region, 
or local area regarding transition planning are assessed, and 
training is individualized. Workshop training,, written 
materials, and other technical assistance are provided. 

• FACTS/LRE (Family and Child Transitions into Least 
Restrictive Environments) at the University of Illinois in 
Champaign, Illinois. The purpose of the project is to address 
the process for transition planning for children, 2-1/2 through 
5 years of age, with a broad range of disabilities or 
developmental delays, who are moving from early intervention 
to preschool and from preschool to elementary school. The 
model focuses on strategies to assist families in planning and 
selecting community child care services. It includes a planning 
process for community interagency coordinating councils to 
develop and implement agreements between local public 
schools and early intervention agencies to facilitate cooperative 
screening, assessment, referral, and transition. 



OTHER OSEP PROGRAMS BENEFITTING YOUNG CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES 

OSEP continues to support a number of projects designed to promote innovative 
strategies for the delivery of services to young children with disabilities and their 
families. Priorities include the development of more effective practices, the 
development of region-specific or population-specific program models, enhanced 
training of existing personnel, and identification of strategies to recruit individuals into 
relevant fields of study.

The Early Education Program for Children with Disabilities 



The Early Education Program for Children with Disabilities (EEPCD), originally named 
the Handicapped Children's Early Education Program (HCEEP), has been operating for 
the past 25 years. Its original mission was to establish model demonstration projects 
for the delivery of special education and related services to young children with 
disabilities, from birth through grade three. It has evolved as State and local early 
intervention systems have matured. It presently supports States as they develop two 
processes: first, development of comprehensive services for infants and toddlers with 
disabilities, from birth through age 2, and their families; second, expansion of services 
for children with disabilities, age 3 through 5, and their families. During FY 1993, 
EEPCD supported 121 projects: 31 demonstration projects, 47 outreach projects, 29 in- 
service training projects, 7 research and experimental projects, 6 research institutes, and 
1 national technical assistance center. 



Demonstration Projects 

EEPCD's demonstration projects address a variety of topics. They include the 
following: 

• multidisciplinary intervention services for children and 
families; 

• interagency collaboration in the provision of services; 

• family and professional collaboration; 

• an examination of differing service delivery models; 

• coordination between public and private agencies; 

• curriculum development; 

• evaluation of child progress; 

• services for infants with special health needs, including HIV 
infection and AIDS; and 

• methods of collaboration between allied health and special 
education service providers. 

Outreach Projects 

Outreach projects have two goals: to increase the availability of high-quality services 
to young children with disabilities and to promote replication of innovative models or 
components of models which were developed under the demonstration or inservice 




66 



16th Annual Report To Congress: Charter 2 



components of EEPCD or have had other development funding. All of the 47 projects 
receiving outreach funding have a multi-State or national focus and are funded for 
three years. Outreach efforts focus on improving training and services, as well as on 
interagency and inter-State collaboration. All are required to coordinate their 
dissemination and replication activities with the State lead agencies under Part H 
and/or the Preschool Grant Program. 



Experimental Projects 

Nondirected experimental projects compare educational practices and intervention 
procedures related to early childhood services. During FY 1993, four newly funded 
projects addressed language instruction, intervention in inclusive versus segregated 
settings, bilingual /bicultural training for preschoolers who are deaf, and 
paraprofessional training systems. 



Research Projects 

EEPCD is funding three research projects. Two investigate language intervention 
issues, and one focuses on motor functioning. 



Research Institutes 

Six research institutes are supported. These institutes investigate: 

• cost and effectiveness of early intervention; 

• interventions for children affected by parental substance abuse; 

• interventions to assist children and families in making 
transitions from hospital to home, from home to preschool 
services, and from preschool to public school; 

• barriers to mainstreaming in preschools; 

• behavior-based developmental care and intervention in the 
neonatal intensive care unit; and 

• influences on service patterns and utilization in early 
intervention and preschool programs.

NEC'TAS 



OSEP also supports NEC*TAS, which brings together individuals and organizations 
representing a range of disciplines and parental perspectives to address the infant, 
toddler, and preschool provisions of IDEA. A central organizational function is 
providing technical assistance to States' Part H and Preschool Grant Program grantees. 
Main areas of technical assistance for the Part H system include service coordination, 
finance, interagency issues, procedural safeguards, personnel, data collection, 
monitoring, child identification, and public awareness. Main areas of technical 
assistance for the Preschool Grant Program community include program standards and 
monitoring, LRE and inclusion, personnel, finance, interagency agreements, child 
identification, legislation, transition, and public awareness. 



Personnel Preparation 

Personnel preparation is another component of the OSEP mission. During FY 1993, the 
Division of Personnel Preparation funded 245 projects addressing personnel needs in 
early intervention and preschool services. Projects focus on preparing personnel to 
serve infants, toddlers, and preschoolers; leadership personnel projects; special projects; 
projects to prepare related services personnel; and projects to serve special populations, 
rural populations, and low-incidence populations. Among the projects sponsored by 
OSEP are the following: 

• Northeast Early Intervention Faculty Training Institute at 
Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The purpose 
of the project is to develop and implement a faculty training 
institute for early intervention personnel. Faculty members in 
12 States representing 10 disciplines are trained to incorporate 
basic early intervention content into existing coursework, to 
develop new coursework to include critical areas of early 
intervention content, and to provide periodic in-service training 
that offers participants continuing education credits. 

• Institute and faculty in-service training for related services 
personnel at New York Medical College in Valhalla, New York. 
The purpose of the project is to provide in-service coursework 
and practica to related services personnel who provide or 
coordinate early intervention services to infants, toddlers, and 
their families, and to develop a model in-service program for 
university faculty from related services disciplines. Training is 
team-based and interdisciplinary. It consists of multiple three- 
hour group training sessions and individual long-term follow- 
ups.

Development Center at the University of North Carolina at 
Chapel Hill. The purpose of the project is to develop, 
implement, and evaluate a faculty training model related to 
Part H content and to facilitate linkages between institutes of 
higher education and State agencies implementing the 
personnel preparation component of Part H. Faculty members 
from 13 States and two Outlying Areas are provided training 
on Part H content areas. They are helped to incorporate state- 
of-the-art information related to Part H content and training 
into the in-service training they provide to practitioners. 



SUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS 

Several significant events affecting the Part H and Preschool Grants Program systems 
at the Federal and State levels occurred during FY 1993. Publication of Part H 
regulations completed the reauthorization process begun in 1991 and clarified new 
requirements for the organization and delivery of early intervention services. The 
Federal Interagency Coordinating Council was established by law and met for the first 
time. This important forum will continue to provide Federal agencies, families, and 
State representatives an opportunity to share concerns about Part H implementation 
and determine how to ensure that all appropriate resources are coordinated to serve 
children and families in an effective manner. 

The number of States and jurisdictions moving into fifth-year futf implementation of 
Part H during FY 1992 increased significantly, from 18 1;. The 12 with extended 
participation status have until the spring of 1994 to appty for a full implementation Part 
H grant. Only one State, Mississippi, did net apply for a Part H grant during FY 1992. 
Mississippi is studying its early intervention plans and will probably re-enter the 
program eventually. 

States reported that 15 percent more infants and toddlers received services under 
Chapter 1 (SOP) programs in FY 1993. Most States reported an increase in the number 
of children receiving services since FY 1992, eight were unchanged, and five reported 
declines. Although the overall national child count declined from 1.4 percent to 1.2 
percent of the population of infants and toddlers, this decline occurred primarily 
because large numbers of non-Part H at-risk children are no longer included in the 
child counts of two States. 

States continue to struggle with significant issues as they implement Part H systems. 
These issues include the volume of policy decisions, the challenging fiscal situation 
confronted by the States, and a lack of lead agency direct authority or power, which can 
result in time-consuming negotiations and compromise in order to achieve needed 
consensus. The familiar themes of fragmentation, duplication, and overlap continue to 
impede the development of cohesive, coordinated systems.

The number of children receiving special education and related services under the 
Preschool Grants Program continued to increase in FY 1993. The overall increase was 
9 percent, but it is important to note that growth in this population occurred among 
younger preschoolers in particular. It appears that earlier identification of children with 
disabilities, as well as improved transition to the Preschool Grant Program from the 
Part H system, is enabling more children to receive preschool services at earlier ages. 

States are improving coordination between the Part H and Preschool Grant Program 
systems as they strive to provide a seamless system for children from birth through age 
5. Some States are using IFSPs for services for this age group. Others are offering them 
as an option. 

Two significant issues are the efficient transition of children and their families from 
Part H to the Preschool Grant Program and providing services in the least restrictive 
environment. Transition planning is now a key component of the Part K regulations, 
and will promote vital collaboration and formal agreements between the two systems. 

Providing services in the least restrictive environment, a major goal for all children 
receiving special education and related services, can be particularly problematic for 
preschool-age children, because there often are no public programs for peers without 
disabilities to begin with. Strengthening traditional linkages with such programs as 
Head Start and the development of new alliances with the preschool and child care 
communities will enhance the achievement of this goal. 

During FY 1993, the Early Education Program for Children with Disabilities (EEPCD) 
supported 121 projects, including 31 demonstration projects, 29 in-service training 
projects, 47 outreach projects, 7 research and experimental projects, 6 research institutes, 
and one national technical assistance center. These projects focus on issues such as 
multidisciplinary intervention services for children and families, family and professional 
collaboration, and curriculum development. Among the research projects supported 
are intervention in inclusive versus segregated settings, paraprofessional training 
systems, and research on language intervention and motor functioning. There is also 
significant emphasis on infusing family-centered principles throughout the pre-service 
and in-service training of existing faculty.

Aspects Of The School Programs And Educational Results For Students 
With Disabilities In Regular Secondary Schools 1 



Few discussions of the status of education in the 1990s avoid reference to results, 
otherwise known as "educational outcomes." Educational outcomes are "the results of 
interactions between students and the educational system" (National Center on 
Education Outcomes, 1993) - students' knowledge and skills and their achievement of 
marker events or statuses, such as completing high school Concerns that student's 
knowledge, skills, and achievements are inadequate drive the movements to reform 
educational structures and instructional practices and to set higher standards for 
student achievement. Concerns that results are poorly measured drive the current 
emphasis on revamping assessment practices. Concerns that the wrong results are 
emphasized drive the debates about what students need to learn and about how 
differences in students' goals and abilities can be accommodated. 

The need for a comprehensive analysis of results for students with disabilities as v/ell 
as for the student population as a whole has been recognized. Whereas much energy 
in the past two decades was directed toward ensuring that students with disabilities 
had access to a free and appropriate public education, questions now are being raised 
about what students are achieving as a result of their education (National Council on 
Disabilities, 1993). What kinds of programs do students with disabilities in secondary 
schools experience? What aspects of those programs help or hinder their performance 
in school? In part because answers to these questions were not available for students 
with disabilities nationally, Congress authorized the Secretary of Education to conduct 
a longitudinal study of "the educational progress of students with disabilities while in 
special education" [U.S.C. §1418(e)(2)(A)]. In 1985, under contract to the Office of 
Special Education Programs (OSEP), SRI International began to develop the design, 
sample, and data collection instruments for the National Longitudinal Transition Study 
of Special Education Students (NLTS). Under a separate contract, SRI initiated the 
study in 1987. 

Presented here are highlights of findings from the NLTS regarding selected aspects of 
the programs and performance of the 92 percent of students with disabilities who 
attend regular secondary schools. 2 This discussion is intended to do three things: 

• Describe key aspects of the courses taken by students with 

disabilities in secondary schools, focusing on the balance 
among academic, vocational, and life skills curricula in

* Overall, 8 percent of students with disabilities of secondary school age attended special schools serving only students with disabilities. Proportions 
ranged from 2 percent of students with learning disabilities to 63 percent of students who were deaf. The programs of students In special schools

students' school programs. Academic and vocational course- 
taking for students with disabilities, including the placement of 
students in regular education classes for academic courses, is 
described in further detail. 

Describe key aspects of the performance of students with 
disabilities in secondary schools. The focus here is on three 
aspects of performance: absenteeism from school, as an 
indicator of students' engagement in the educational process; 
grades, as an indicator of general success in school; and school 
completion, as an indicator of persistence in the education 
process. 

Identify the contributions of school programs to student 
performance. Understanding the school factors related to 
student performance can help schools identify ways to help 
students with disabilities succeed. 



COURSE-TAKING IN REGULAR SECONDARY SCHOOLS 

High school graduation requirements stipulate the total number and the types of credits 
secondary school students must earn for a diploma. As reform discussions have 
focused on increasing the number of academic requirements, the special education 
community has engaged in extensive discussions about the relative importance of 
academic and vocational coursework for students with disabilities (Edgar, 1987; 
Sansone, 1987). What is the balance of courses students with disabilities take in regular 
secondary schools? 



An Overview 

The NLTS has measured the percentage of credits that students with disabilities earned 
in academic courses, vocational courses, life skills courses, or other areas to indicate the 
relative emphases on these types of courses. 3 Credits in these areas have been 
translated into standard Carnegie units. A Carnegie unit is equivalent to one class that 
meets five times a week for a full school year. 

Students with disabilities who graduated from high school earned a total of 22 credits, 
compared with an average of 23 credits earned by graduates in the general population 
(Kolstad & Thorne, 1989). Requirements for high school graduation vary by State, but 
on the average, States require students to have 11 or 12 credits in academic subjects 
(Education Commission of the States, 1992) Overall, students with disabilities who 



Academic courses Included English, mathematics, social science, science, and foreign language courses. Vocational courses Included general 
career and employment preparation courses, as well as more specific instruction in occupational areas such as business, Industrial arts, construction, 
or mechanics. Lrfe skills courses included courses in health, home economics, family and Interpersonal relations, and food and nutrition. 

1 f 



1 6th Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 3 



graduated met this requirement, earning an average of 12 credits in academic classes, 
or 55 percent of their total credits, compared to 69 percent of credits earned in academic 
classes by students in the general population. Students with disabilities also earned 5 
credits in vocational courses, or 24 percent of their total, compared with 18 percent for 
students in the general population. These data demonstrate that access to vocational 
courses is no longer an issue for many students with disabilities, whose participation 
in vocational education surpassed that of students in the general population. Life skills 
courses constituted a single credit, which was 6 percent of the total. The remaining 
credits were distributed among other courses. 

Differences in course-taking emphases for students with different disabilities are 
generally not large. For example, the proportion of credits earned in academic classes 
ranged from a high of 65 percent for students with visual impairments tc 50 percent 
for those with multiple disabilities. Conversely, students with visual impairments 
earned the lowest proportion of credits in vocational courses (14 percent), and students 
with mental retardation earned the highest (27 percent). Students with mental 
retardation or multiple disabilities also earned the highest proportion of life skills 
credits (9 percent). 

The distribution of course types shifted as students with disabilities progressed through 
school. The percentage of academic courses earned decreased with each grade level, 
while the percentage of vocational credits increased (see figure 3.1). Whereas students 
who graduated took 62 percent of their courses in academic subjects in grade 9, they 
took only 45 percent in grade 12. The emphasis on vocational courses increased from 
14 percent of credits earned in 9th grade to 35 percent for 12th-graders. 

The following sections provide more detailed information on the academic and 
vocational courses taken by students with disabilities, which were the kinds of courses 
they usually took in regular secondary schools. 



Academic Course-Taking 

Virtually all students with disabilities took at least one academic course during each of 
their four years in high school. As presented in table 3.1, 9th-grade students earned 3.2 
credits in academic courses, declining to 2.2 credits in 12th grade (p<.001). Students in 
all disability categories showed a consistent decline in academic course-taking across 
grade levels, as did students with varying demographic characteristics. 

Although almost all students took academic classes, they varied in the number of 
academic credits they earned. Students with visual impairments earned the most 
academic credits cumulatively (14.7), followed by those with hearing, speech, or 
orthopedic impairments (13.5 to 13.9 credits). The students in these disability categories 
were also significantly more likely to go on to postsecondary education (Marder, 1992). 
Probably because they had postsecondary education in mind, they tended to surpass 
the 11 to 12 academic credits required by many States for high school graduation, and 
instead mirrored more closely the 15 academic credits earned by students without 
disabilities. Youth with mental retardation, multiple disabUities, learning disabilities,

or emotional disabilities earned the fewest credits (11.2 to 11.9 credits, p<.001 compared 
with other categories). 

Several reasons account for these variations in the number of academic credits earned. 
The reasons are different for students in different disability categories. Among the four 
disability categories earning the fewest credits, students classified as having mental 
retardation or multiple disabilities spent fewer hours in academic courses than students 
with other disabilities. For example., in 9th grade, students with mental retardation 
completed 18 hours of academic coursework, compared with 20 hours completed by 
those with visual impairments (p<.001). In contrast, students with serious emotional 
disturbance spent about the same amount of time in academic courses as most other 
students with disabilities, but they were significantly more likely to receive failing 
grades and therefore did not accumulate credit for the class time invested (Waener, 
1991a). B 



16m Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 3

Students' ethnic background and socioeconomic status also were related to differences 
in the number of academic credits earned. However, ethnic background seemed to be 
related to academic course-taking only in the early grades. For example, in 9th grade, 
white students earned significantly more academic credits than their Hispanic peers (3.3 
credits vs. 2.7 credits, p<.01), and in 10th grade, they earned significantly more 
academic credits than their African American peers (3.2 credits vs. 2.8 credits, p<.01). 
By the 11th and 12th grades, there were no longer significant differences between white 
students and others in the number of academic credits earned by students who 
remained in high school until the upper grades. In contrast, students from wealthier 
families consistently earned more academic credits each year in high school than did 
their peers from less wealthy families. Those from wealthier families earned 12.4 
academic credits cumulatively, whereas those from families earning $25,000 or less had 
accumulated 10.4 academic credits (p<.01). 

Placement for Academic Classes. In the mid-1980s in regular secondary schools, inclusion 
in regular education classrooms was a reality for most students with disabilities. As 
a group, they spent 70 percent of their class time in regular education settings. The 
degree of inclusion ranged from 87 percent of class time for students with visual 
impairments to 32 percent of class time for those with multiple disabilities. However, 
the performance of students with disabilities is likely to be influenced more by the 
extent of their regular education placement for academic classes than by placement as 
a whole, which includes regular education settings for physical education or home 
economics, for example. Thus, this analysis focuses on the percentage of a student's 
class hours that were spent in regular education academic classes. 

Table 3.2 indicates that almost one-fourth (23 percent) of students with disabilities spent 
10 percent or less of their class time in regular education academic classes, and about 
the same percentage (27 percent) spent more than half their class time in those classes, 
with an average of one-third of their time overall. Wide variation is noted for youth 
in different disability categories. Students with visual impairments spend the greatest 
time in regular education academic classes (57 percent of class time, on average), and 
students with mental retardation or multiple disabilities spend the least time (14 percent 
and 12 percent; p<.001). 

Involvement in regular education classrooms influences the performance of students 
with disabilities negatively, for several reasons. First, it was the inability to succeed in 
regular education settings that qualified many students with disabilities for special 
education originally. Second, regular education classrooms have higher student-to- 
teacher ratios than special education settings, a fact that potentially reduces the amount 
of individualized attention students with disabilities might receive there. Specifically, 
the average regular education academic class in which students with disabilities 
participated had one teacher and 23 students, two or three of whom were special 
education students. In contrast, special education classes averaged one teacher, a part- 
time aide, and nine students with disabilities. Regular education teachers with 
mainstreamed students reported that 92 percent of students with disabilities in their 
classes were expected to keep up with other students. Eighty-six percent actually did 
so. Third, although most students with disabilities received some kind of 
accommodation in regular education classrooms, the support most frequently reported

student was less common. For example, only 35 percent of students with disabilities 
who were mainstreamed received tutoring, and just 27 percent received extra one-on- 
one instruction. Many students without disabilities find the regular education 
classroom a difficult environment in which to succeed. For students with disabilities, 
the problem can be exacerbated by the lack of appropriate accommodations. 



Vocational Course-Taking 

One objective of secondary vocational education is "motivating students to remain in 
school" (Catterall & Stern, 1986; Weber & Mertens, 1987). In the general population 
there is evidence that, for students who remain in school until 11th grade, vocational 
education may provide curricular options that better fit the goals and interests of 
students who are not college-bound (Lotto, 1988). Earlier NUTS analyses, based on 
school records only for students' most recent year in school, also suggest that 
occupational vocational education may decrease the likelihood of a student dropping 
out, as well as a benefit other aspects of students' school performance (Wagner, 1991c). 
Among 12th-graders with transition plans for their post-school years, employment was 
the transition goal for 68 percent of students; 23 percent had college as a post-school 
transition goal (Cameto, 1993). Among youth with disabilities who had been out of 
school up to two years, 46 percent were working competitively for pay (D'Amico & 
Blackorby, 1992), whereas only 5 percent were attending a two-year or four-year college 
(Butler-Nalin & Wagner, 1991). 

Figure 3.2 depicts the rate at which students with disabilities took at least one 
vocational education class, by grade level and cumulatively. Nearly all students 
assigned to a grade level took a vocational education class at some point during high 
school. Moreover, many students with disabilities had experiences in vocational 
education early in high school: 68 percent of 9th-graders and 77 percent of lOth-graders 
took some vocational education. The number of students who participated increased 
throughout secondary school - 89 percent of 12th-graders took at least one vocational 
course. On the other hand, only 54 percent of students not assigned to a grade level 
took vocational education classes. For students with disabilities, vocational education 
has expanded beyond its traditional role as an elective category available primarily to 
students in their later years of high school. 

Figure 3.2 also depicts the extent of participation in occupationally oriented vocational 
education (i.e., training in specific job skills, not more general job-readiness skills), by 
grade level and cumulatively for students with disabilities. In their first year of high 
school, 58 percent of students with disabilities had taken at least one occupational 
vocational education class. The number of students exposed to occupational vocational 
education increased with each successive year of secondary school. Cumulatively, 
nearly all students with disabilities had some kind of occupational voc tonal education.

Students' experiences with vocational education vary considerably. Vocational 
education and its relationship to school performance can be analyzed by considering 
two factors: intensity of instruction and participation in work experience as a 
component of vocational education. 

Intensity of instruction. Students in secondary schools had the opportunity to become 
"concentrators" in a vocational content area by taking four or more semesters of 
instruction in a particular area (e.g., agriculture). Some hypothesize that this 
concentration of instruction builds the skills that will later translate into success in the 
labor market. Thus, students who were concentrators may see the value of their school 
experiences more than other students, be absent less, and have a lower dropout rate 
than if they did not have a concentration in vocational education, 




82 



16m Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 3 



However, concentrating in vocational education was not common. The majority of 
students participated in survey vocational classes, regardless of grade level (e.g., 77 
percent of students in 9th grade had taken survey courses only; 62 percent of those in 
12th grade had done so). However, the rate at which students concentrated in 
vocational education rose steadily from 4 percent through 10th grade to 34 percent 
through 12th grade. Thus, by the end of high school, one in tltree students with 
disabilities had taken four or more courses in a single vocational education area. These 
students may have a more coherent job-related skill base than their peers whose 
vocational experiences were not as focused. 

Table 3.3 depicts the degree of concentration in vocational education through 10th, 11th, 
and 12th grades by disability category. Through 12th grade, students with learning 
disabilities were the most likely to have concentrated in a vocational content area (40 
percent), a significantly higher rate of concentration than peers with multiple disabilities 
(17 percent) or visual impairments (19 percent). Students with learning disabilities also 
were more likely to have concentrated in vocational education earlier. By 11th grade, 
22 percent of students with learning disabilities were concentrators, compared with 13 
percent or fewer of students in any other category. Thus, youth with learning 
disabilities attended and earned credits in related concentrations of vocational classes 
earlier than peers in other categories. 

Several variations in vocational concentration by demographic factors are significant 
and relatively stable over time (table 3.4). For example, female students were 
significantly less likely than males at all grade levels to concentrate or participate in 
vocational education. Similarly, African American students were significantly less likely 
than white peers to receive vocational education through 10th grade and to take 
concentrations of vocational education through each of the three years. There is not a 
strong association between household income and concentration in vocational 
education. White students and male students had greater attendance than other groups 
in "concentrated" vocational courses. Thus, they may have a better job-oriented skill 
base than peers with less vocational experience. 

Work experience. Since the early days of the transition movement, practitioners have 
stressed the importance of work experience for students with disabilities. Much 
research has suggested that students who had paid work experience during secondary 
school were more likely than students without such experience to find jobs for pay after 
leaving school (Hasazi, Gordon, & Roe, 1985). Earlier NLTS findings support this 
conclusion (D'Amico, 1991), suggesting that students who had work-study jobs in 
secondary school were 14 percentage points more likely than students without that 
experience to have found paid competitive jobs when they had been out of school up 
to two years. Proponents also suggest that work experience, as part of a vocational 
education curriculum, further demonstrates the relevance of the vocational curriculum 
to students and increases student engagement in school. 

Others contend, however, that the effects of working during school might be 
detrimental for students in that hours spent working are not spent doing homework. 
They also contend that the attractiveness of "premature prosperity" might make staying 
in school seem less advantageous than leaving school to work full time. However, the

NLTS found no relationship between having a paid job in a given school year and 
school performance in that year (Wagner, 1991a). 

Table 3.5 indicates that although 39 percent of students with disabilities overall had 
some exposure to work experience programs during high school, students with mental 
retardation (45 percent) and students with multiple disabilities (50 percent) were 
significantly more likely than peers with speech impairments (32 percent) or visual 
impairments (27 percent), serious emotional disturbance (30 percent), or students who 
were hard of hearing (34 percent) to receive this kind of training. These estimates are 
somewhat higher than those reported in the National High School Transcript Study, 
which reported that students earned 17 percent of vocational education credits through 
work experience programs (Hayward & Wirt, 1989). However, NLTS estimates are 
lower than those of Benz (in press), who reports that 54 percent of students took work 
experience programs. 

Demographic characteristics, on the other hand, do not appear related to the likelihood 
of participation in work experience programs. Gender, for example, does not appear 
related to work experience, nor does household income. However, white students had 
work experience in greater numbers than their African American or Hispanic peers 
(p<.05). 



ABSENTEEISM, GRADES, AND DROPOUT RATES OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES 
ATTENDING SECONDARY SCHOOL 

The preceding section described variations in the programs of students with disabilities 
who attended regular secondary schools. The performance of those students varied 
widely. This section describes the absenteeism, grades, and dropout rates of students 
with disabilities and the impact these factors have on student performance. 



Absenteeism 

The problem of absenteeism in the general student population is well documented. 
High levels of absenteeism are associated with a host of negative results, including 
lower grades and increased probability of a failure to complete a secondary education 
(Thornton & Zigmond, 1987; Wagner, 1991a). These factors, in turn, have documented 
negative effects on post-school adjustment measures (Rumberger, 1987; Wagner, 
Blackorby, Cameto, and Newman, 1994). Extreme levels of voluntary absenteeism can 
symbolize students' disconnectedness from school and the educational process as a 
whole. Regardless of whether voluntary or involuntary due to illness, substantial 
absenteeism makes it difficult to complete class requirements and receive passing 
grades and deprives students of some of their educational experience (Wehlage et al., 
1989).

129 



To what degree were students with disabilities absent from secondary school? On 
average, students who remained in high school for four grade levels missed nearly 
three weeks of school per year. Table 3.6 shows that students missed 15 days each in 
9th and 10th grades, 16 days in 11th grade, and 14.5 days in 12th grade. Students who 
were not assigned to a grade level were absent an average of 16 days annually. 
However, these averages mask widely varying levels of absenteeism. Approximately 
one-half of students with disabilities missed 10 or fewer days of school per year, and 
about another one-fourth missed between 2 and 3 weeks. Between 21 percent and 25 
percent of students missed 4 weeks or more of the typical 39 weeks of school. Thus, 
substantial mimbers of students with disabilities missed a sizeable portion of their 
educational dme each year of high school. Further, the level of absenteeism among 
students with disabilities is somewhat larger than that in the general population. Jones 
et al. (1983) found that 17 percent of students in the general population missed more 
than 4 weeks of school per year. 

Average absenteeism differed significantly for students in different disability categories. 
Students with serious emotional disturbance (SED) or other health impairments missed 
more school than their peers in most other disability categories. On the other hand, 
students with sensory or speech impairments typically missed less school than students 
in other categories. In 9th grade, students with SED averaged significantly more 
absences than students who were hard of hearing (18 days vs. 11 days; p<.05). 
Students with health impairments also missed a considerable amount of school (16 days 
on average, probably because of illness or medical treatments). In contrast, students 
with SED were more likely than other students to evidence a variety of indicators of 
disconnectedness from school (e.g., low rates of school group membership and high 
rates of affiliation with friends outside of school; (Newman, 1991). This finding 
suggests that their absenteeism was more likely to be voluntary, which is another 
indicator of disassociation from school. 

Ethnic group membership appears to be strongly related to absenteeism. African 
American and Hispanic students were absent more often than their white peers in 9th 
grade (19 days vs. 12 days; p<.05). The difference in absenteeism between African 
American and white students is consistent across grade levels. However, the Hispanic 
students who stayed in school missed fewer days later in high school (e.g. 14 days in 
12th grade vs. 19 days in 9th grade) and were more similar to white students than to 
their African American peers in 11th and 12th grades. These findings largely resemble 
findings in the general population, in which African American students missed more 
school than their white counterparts (NCES, 1984). 

Students from wealthier households tended to miss fewer days of school than their less 
wealthy peers. Students from households earning more than $25,000 annually missed 
11 days of school in 9th grade, significantly fewer than the 19 days missed by their 
peers from families earning less than $12,000 annually (p<.05). This difference is 
consistent with other research that suggests that absenteeism is more prevalent among 
students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds (Bachman, 1970; Scott-Jones, 
1984; Wilson, 1987).

af Each grade level sample includes all students with data for that grade level, whether or not data exist for those same students for other grade 
levels. The sample for the cumulative measures on tables in this chapter is made up of those students for whom data were available for all 
four high school grade levels. Students not assigned to grade levels are not included here because they often did not earn academic credits. 

Standard errors are In parentheses. 

Source: National Longitudinal Transition Study. 



Grade Performance 

Students with disabilities who completed four years of high school earned a cumulative 
grade point average GPA of 2.3 (table 3.7). 4 This GPA is about one-half of a grade 
below the national average of 2.6 earned by typical students in the 1980 sophomore 
class (NCES, 1984). Students with disabilities demonstrated an increase in GPA at 
succeeding grade levels. 

Table 3.7 also shows the percentage of students with disabilities who failed at least one 
class at each grade level and cumulatively over the four years they spent in secondary 
school. A majority of students with disabilities experienced some failure in high school; 



Readers should remember that not all students with disabilities received grades in high school. Overall, 1 1 percent of students with disabilities did 
not receive grades. Figures ranged from 2 percent of students with speech Impairments to 56 percent of students with multiple disabilities.

J6rw Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 3 



62 percent failed at least one class at some point. These experiences of course failure 
tended to occur early in secondary school; 43 percent and 44 percent of 9th and 10th 
grade students with disabilities failed one or more classes at those grade levels. The 
percentages of students with disabilities who failed classes decreased in 11th grade (38 
percent) and in 12th grade (23 percent). This change is consistent with the rising GPA 
in the upper grades. 

At least three factors may help explain the apparent improvement in grade performance 
over time. First, like other students who were not academically successful, students 
with disabilities who did not do well were more likely to drop out of school (Wagner, 
1991a; Zigmond, 1987), leaving their more academically successful peers in the later 
grade levels (Peng & Takai, 1987). Second, it is plausible that 12th-graders may be 
subject to more lenient grading standards because they are close to graduation. Third, 
it is also possible that 11th and 12th graders may have completed more of their 
required courses and performed better in their electives. 

Improving grade performance at succeeding grade levels occurred consistently for 
students in all disability categories. Between 9th and 12th grades, GPA increases 
ranged from 0.1 grade point for students who were deaf or hard of hearing or with 
orthopedic impairments to 0.5 grade point for students with speech or language 
impairments or multiple disabilities. Similarly, the percentage of students failing one 
or more courses dropped almost 20 percentage points for students overall. Decreases 
in course failure rates between 9th and 12th grades ranged from 5 percentage points 
for students with visual impairments (whose rate of course failure was low) to 26 
percentage points for students with SED (whose rate was high). 

Further, students in different disability categories earned quite different grades. 
Cumulative GPAs ranged from 2.2 to 2.7. Students who were deaf or hard of hearing 
or with orthopedic impairments consistently earned the highest GPAs and had among 
the lowest course failure rates, whereas students with learning disabilities or SED 
tended to earn lower GPAs and fail more often. The cumulative grade point averages 
of students who were deaf (2.7) and students with orthopedic impairments (2.6), for 
example, were significantly higher than those of their peers with emotional disturbance 
and learning disabilities. Despite relatively low GPAs for students in some categories, 
the GPAs for students in six disability categories were equal to or higher than the 2.6 
earned by students in the goneral population. 

Female students with disabilities consistently earned higher GPAs and were less likely 
to fail courses than their male peers (table 3.8). The GPA differences typically are small 
(0.1 to 0.2 grade point), as are differences in failure rates (from 4 percentage points in 
12th grade to 12 percentage points in 11th grade, p<.01), but they are prevalent across 
all four grade levels. 

Ethnic group membership is related to academic performance in the general population 
(Alexander, Cook, and McDill, 1978; Rumberger, 1983), as well as among students with 
disabilities. Cumulatively, white students earned higher GPAs and were less likely to

fail courses than their African American peers (2.4 vs. 2.0 for GPAs; 58 percent vs. 76 
percent failure rates, p<.001). The differences between these two groups are 
particularly noticeable at the lower grade levels. 

Comparisons of the performance of Hispanic students with disabilities with that of 
students from other ethnic groups are less clear. In 9th grade, for example, Hispanic 
students - like African Americans - earned lower GPAs than white peers (1.8 vs. 2.1, 
p<.01). In subsequent years, however, the Hispanic students' pattern was very different 
from that of their African American peers. Indeed, the Hispanic students appeared to 
catch up to white students, so that by 12th grade their average GPA exceeded that of 
their white peers. A similar pattern exists for course failure rates. These results are 
similar to some studies and different from others that have investigated academic 
performance across ethnic groups. The observed changes over time may be related to 
a differential dropout rate across ethnic groups. It may be that Hispanic students who 
failed early in high school dropped out then, and those who remained were more 
capable. Also, the controversy over application of differential grading practices to 
students from different ethnic backgrounds may need to be considered. Nevertheless, 
in this study it is clear that the average GPAs of Hispanic students with disabilities 
climbed steadily during their high school careers, while their overall rate of course 
failure declined. 

Table 3.8 further suggests that there js a modest but unwavering pattern for students 
from higher income households to earn higher GPAs and to have lower course failure 
rates than other students. The GPA differences, however, are small throughout and are 
statistically significant only in the 9th grade. Differences in course failure rates are 
more substantial. Cumulatively, 57 percent of students from families earning more than 
$25,000 per year failed one or more classes, compared with 68 percent and 70 percent 
of students in lower income categories (p<.05). Although this pattern applies in all four 
years of secondary school, the relationships are strongest in the first two years of high 
school. As was the case in other performance categories, it is possible that these 
differences represent performance differences, behaviors, or standards, or they may 
simply mean that some students failed classes early on and dropped out, leaving the 
more successful students in the later grades. 



Dropping Out 

Students who do not complete their secondary schooling face a difficult world as adults 
(Lichtenstein, 1993; Thornton & Zigmond, 1987; Wagner, Blackorby, Cameto, & 
Newman, 1994). Their experiences are characterized by lower levels of employment 
and wages and by higher rates of problems with the law. 

Approximately 30 percent of students with disabilities whc had been enrolled in 9th 
through 12th grades failed to complete their secondary schooling. Earlier NLTS 
findings showed that approximately 8 percent of students with disabilities dropped out 
of school before enrolling in 9th grade (Wagner, 1991b). The estimate of a 38 percent 
dropout rate is consistent with estimates from other local and State studies that found 



ERLC 



142 

16th Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 3 97 



dropout rates to be in the 35 percent to 45 percent range (Blackorby, Edgar, & 
Kortering, 1991; Hasazi, Gordon, & Roe, 1985; Zigmond & Thornton, 1987). 

If students with disabilities progressed to high school, they tended to stay in high 
school until they were the same age as typical students who graduated. The average 
age at which high school students with disabilities dropped out was 18. For 
graduation, the average age was 19. Yet dropouts had relatively little to show for their 
several high school years. On average, they dropped out with fewer than 10 credits, 
despite having been in school until age 18. 

Disability category is an important factor influencing the likelihood of completing 
secondary school (table 3.9). As was the case in a number of performance measures, 
students with emotional disturbances were far more likely than their peers in any other 
disability category to drop out of school (e.g., cumulatively, 48 percent among those 
ever enrolled in high school; at least p<.01). In addition, students with mental 
retardation, learning disabilities, other health impairments, or speech impairments 
dropped out in substantial numbers (from 23 percent to 30 percent). Students with 
hearing or visual impairments or multiple disabilities were least likely to drop out (11 
percent to 15 percent). 

Demographic factors also were related to the failure to complete secondary school. 
Although students of both genders appear to have left school in equal numbers overall 
and at each grade level, both ethnic background and household income were related 
to the rate at which students with disabilities dropped out (table 3.10). White students 
dropped out in smaller numbers than their African American or Hispanic peers (25 
percent vs. 39 percent and 34 percent; p<.01). Students from families with higher 
incomes dropped out less often than their peers from families of lesser means (23 
percent of students from families earning more than $25,000 per year, compared with 
31 percent and 37 percent from families earning between $12,000 and $25,000 and less 
than $12,000, respectively). These findings are consistent with much previous research 
that poor students and students from minority groups are at greater risk for dropping 
out of school. 



THE RELATIONSHIP OF SCHOOL PROGRAMS TO STUDENT PERFORMANCE 

The NLTS has been guided since its inception by a conceptual framework that 
illustrates the complex interplay of factors that shape students' performance. Individual 
and household characteristics, including parent involvement and expectations, have 
powerful influences on how well students perform in school (Wagner, Blackorby, & 
Hebbeler, 1993). Yet schools share responsibility, along with parents and students, for 
student performance. This section describes the significant relationships between the 
school programs of students with disabilities, described earlier, and student 
performance.

The preceding sections have demonstrated that the programs students with disabilities 
experienced in regular secondary schools varied markedly according to the nature of 
their disabilities, as intended by law. It is not accurate to simply compare the 
performance of students who took vocational education with the performance of 
students who did not, for example, and attribute those differences to exposure to 
vocational training, because vocational students differed from non-vocational students 
in disability, gender, and ethnic background. Multivariate analytic techniques are 
needed to statistically control for the many interrelationships between students, school 
programs, and performance. The following findings result from such analyses, which 
statistically hold constant the characteristics of individuals and households 5 in order 



The variables in the statistical models reported here include the following: primary disability category, functional mental skills and self-care skills 
scale scores, gender, household income, ethnic background, a dichotomous variable indicating that the student came from a single-parent 
household, and Indicators of prior school performance (absenteeism and course failure).

to identify the independent contributions that academic course-taking in regular 
education settings, vocational education participation, and work-study enrollment has 
on student performance. 



Academic Course-Taking 

Previous NLTS analyses considered the relationship of course-taking and performance 
in terms of the overall percentage of time students spent in regular education. Those 
results suggeisted that students who spent more time in regular education were more 
likely to fail a class than those who spent less time there. Current analyses redefine 
course-taking in terms of the amount of time spent in academic classes in regular 
education settings. Despite this change in variables, the present grade level analyses 
confirm previous findings (table 3.11). Students who spent most of their time in regular 
education academic classes were estimated to be 10 percentage points more likely to fail 
a class in 9th grade than peers who spent just half of their time there, independent of 
other differences between them. This effect is strongest in 9th grade and decreases with 
each successive grade level. The decline may be due to either of two factors: youth 
who drop out early in high school or increased participation in vocational education in 
the later years. 

Alternatively, the relationship between course-taking and course failure in later years 
may become less direct, operating through its effects on earlier course failure, which is 
also controlled in these analyses. The relationship of taking academic regular education 
classes to absenteeism is complex. The relationships are small overall but are 
statistically significant and they operate in opposite directions in 9th and 12th grades. 
Taking academic regular education classes was not related to dropping out - except 
indirectly, in that it increased the probability of course failure. 



Vocational Course-Taking 

In these analyses, intensity of involvement in vocational education is measured in 
different ways for students at different grade levels to reflect the larger role that 
vocational education plays in students' programs at succeeding grade levels. For 9th 
grade students, the relationship between school performance and the number of hours 
students spent in occupationally specific vocational education during that year is 
analyzed. For lOth-graders, analyses again include the hours spent in occupational 
vocational education, along with a dichotomous variable indicating whether students 
had begun that instruction in the 9th grade or were first-time occupational students in 
10th grade. Dichotomous variables for whether students concentrated in vocational 
education or took survey courses only (as opposed to no vocational or prevocational 
courses) are included in analyses for 11th and 12th graders, grade levels at which 
concentrating in vocational education was common enough for the analyses to detect 
influences on performance.

JtfTH Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 3 



These analyses only partly confirm the hypothesis that vocational instruction, as an 
alternative to academic curricula, ameliorates course failure and assists in dropout 
prevention. The analyses also illustrate the complexity of students' secondary school 
experiences. Time spent in occupational vocational education had little effect on 
performance in either 9th or 10th grades. Nor did beginning occupational training in 
9th rather than 10th grade have an effect on 10th grade performance. In addition, the 
dichotomous variables representing taking a survey of vocational classes and 
concentrating in vocational education were not associated with absenteeism or course 
failure when they were introduced in the 10th and 11th grade analyses. 

These same two factors — taking a concentration in vocational education and taking a 
survey vocational education class — were associated with dramatically lower 
probabilities of dropping out in 11th and 12th grades (from 6 to 19 percentage points, 
p<.001). Interpreting this finding is not straightforward, however. Logically, students 
need to stay in school in order to accumulate enough courses in an area to be a 
concentrator, so the relationship between staying in school and concentrating in 
vocational education can be tautological. To identify the relationship more clearly, the 
analyses for 11th and 12th grade were conducted only with students who had stayed 
in school up to that point but dropped out while in 11th or 12th grade. Thus, 9th and 
10th grade dropouts, whose probability of becoming a concentrator in vocational 
education was lower, were eliminated. The relationship between concentrating and 
lower dropout rates remained. This finding gives greater credence to the hypothesis 
that vocational concentrations and vocational survey courses have some "holding 
power" over students with disabilities. 



Work Experience 

As expected, the current grade level analyses show that student participation in work 
experience programs had a sizeable positive impact on student performance. Although 
the differences were not consistent in magnitude across grade levels, students in work 
experience programs were estimated to miss three fewer days (p<.05) and to be 16 
percentage points less likely to fail a class in 11th grade (p<.01) than their peers who 
did not have such experiences. Students in work experience programs were estimated 
to have a lower probability of dropping out of school by 12th grade (7 percentage 
points, p<.01), perhaps reflecting the indirect effects of lower course failure and 
absenteeism in the previous year. 



SUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS 

These findings report troublesome results for students with disabilities who attended 
regular secondary schools. Absenteeism and dropout rates were higher than for the 
general population of students, and grades were lower. Further, these poor results 
were disproportionately experienced by students in the largest disability categories - 
those with learning disabilities, mental retardation, and SED. They also were more 
common among minority students and those from low-income households.

Although student and household characteristics have a considerable influence on 
student performance, choices in school programs also have been shown to contribute 
to educational performance. On the negative side, NLTS data suggest that regular 
education academic classes of the late 1980s were difficult environments for students 
with disabilities. Students who spent more of their class time in those settings were 
significantly more likely to fail courses than other students, independent of other 
differences between them. Course failure, with its accompanying loss of credits toward 
graduation, was among the most accurate predictors of students later dropping out of 
school. As a counterbalance, vocational courses seem to be a positive factor. Students 
who took a concentration of vocational courses, as well as those who enrolled in survey 
courses in a variety of occupation areas, were significantly less likely than non- 
vocational or prevocational students to drop out of school. Participating in a work 
experience program as part of their vocational education further enhanced the 
probability that students would have fewer absences, succeed in their courses, and 
graduate. 

It is important that these findings inform the current debates about policies such as full 
inclusion of students with disabilities in regular education classes, strengthening of 
academic standards and course requirements for graduation, and school-to-work 
opportunities. Policy should be made with a concern for facts, as well as principles, 
and with a clear understanding of their implications for all students.

Achieving Better Results For Children And Youth With Serious Emotional 
Disturbance 

Students with serious emotional disturbance (SED) pose unique challenges to special 
educators. The behaviors of many of these students frequently require a level of 
support beyond what schools are accustomed to providing. As a result, schools must 
rely on the services of other disciplines and agencies to help them meet the needs of 
SED students, resulting in complex patterns of service delivery within public schools. 
This chapter provides an overview of the characteristics of students with SED, a 
national agenda addressing the needs of students with SED, and a" description of 
projects funded by the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) focusing on 
improving educational opportunities for students with SED. 



OVERVIEW 

Effectively meeting the needs of children and youth with SED and their families is a 
growing national concern. Failure to do so threatens the success of the nation's 
educational objectives (e.g., Goals 2000) and limits lifelong opportunities for many 
people. Part B and Chapter 1 (SOP) programs served over 400,000 school-age students 
with SED last year, and many more such students may remain unidentified and 
unserved. The following data suggest the magnitude of the problem: 

• Academic results. Students with SED have lower grades than 
any other group of students with disabilities. They fail more 
courses, and they more frequently fail minimum competency 
examinations than do other students with disabilities. They 
also are retained at grade level more often at the end of the 
school year. High school students with SED have an average 
grade point average of 1.7 (on a 4-point scale), compared with 
2.0 for all disabled students and 2.6 for all students (Wagner et 
al., 1991). Forty-four percent received one or more failing 
grades in their most recent school year — compared with 31 
percent for all students with disabilities (Wagner et al, 1991). 
Of those who took minimum competency tests (22 percent 
were exempted), 63 percent failed some part of the test 
(Wagner et al, 1991). 

• Dropout and graduation rates. Fifty percent of students with 
SED drop out of school (most by tenth grade). Fifty-eight 
percent leave school without graduating (Wagner, 1991). Only 



ERLC 



15C 

16th Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 4 109 



42 percent graduate, as opposed to 56 percent of all students 
with disabilities and 71 percent of all students (Wagner et al., 
1991). 

• School placement. Eighteen percent of students with SED are 
educated outside of their local schools, compared with 6 
percent of all students with disabilities (U.S. Department of 
Education, OSEP, 1993). Of those in their local schools, fewer 
than 17 percent are educated in regular classrooms, in contrast 
to 33 percent of all students with disabilities (U.S. Department 
of Education, OSEP, 1993). 

• Identification rates of students of varying socioeconomic 
backgrounds. The rates of identification of children and youth 
with SED vary across racial, cultural, gender, and 
socioeconomic lines. Although African American and white 
students represent 16 and 68 percent of the school age 
enrollment respectively, they represent 22 and 71 percent of the 
students classified as SED (U.S. Department of Education, 
OCR, 1993). On the other hand, Hispanic Americans and 
Asian Americans represent 12 and 3 percent of the school-aged 
population respectively, but only 6 and 1 percent of the 
students classified as SED (U.S. Department of Education, 
OCR, 1993). Data also suggest that there is a high 
disproportion of students from disadvantaged socioeconomic 
backgrounds and a low disproportion of female students 
among those identified with SED (Wagner et al., 1991). 

• Encounters with the juvenile justice system. Twenty percent 
of students with SED are arrested at least once before they 
leave school, and 35 percent are arrested within a few years of 
leaving school (Wagner et al., 1991). 

Comparing all students with disabilities and students with SED reveals three 
noteworthy differences: 

• Students with SED are more likely to be placed in restrictive 
settings and are more likely to drop out of school (U.S. 
Department of Education, OSEP, 1993). 

• Their families are more likely to be blamed for the student's 
disability (Caplan & Hall-McCorquodale, 1985; Lefley, 1989; 
Friesen & Koroloff, 1990) and are more likely to make 
tremendous financial sacrifices to secure services for their 
children (Knitzer, Steinberg, & Fleisch, 1991; Cohen, Harris, 
Gottlieb, & Best, 1991; Ervin, 1992). 



110 16m Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 4 

ERIC 157 



• Their teachers and aides are more likely to seek reassignment 

or to leave their positions (U.S. Department of Education, 
OSEP, 1993; Knitzer, Steinberg, & Fleisch, 1990). 



The History of Public School Programs for Students with Emotional Disturbance 

The first public school programs for students with emotional disturbance began more 
than 100 years ago. Yet, throughout the decades, the programs most often were in 
special schools or associated with hospitals, reflecting popular professional beliefs about 
the causes of and treatments for emotional disturbance (Coleman, 1986). Providing 
non-educational services, such as mental health, health care, or other social services, in 
cooperation with schools was not uncommon at the turn of the century (Tyack, 1992). 
However, most of these services have been phased out or have been, in part, assumed 
by other agencies. In general, public schools today do not endorse a broad view of 
their responsibility to serve students with emotional and behavioral disorders. As a 
result, many educational programs for students with SED are fragmented and reflect 
a narrow view of the nature of the students' disability as well as of the special 
education services that should be provided. 

Recent national studies of programs for students with SED (Grosenick, 1989; Knitzer, 
Steinberg, & Fleisch, 1990) indicate that many programs for students with SED are 
focused almost totally on behavior management and social adjustment, with relatively 
little emphasis on building academic and vocational competence. Furthermore, most 
of those programs are operated separately from regular classrooms. 



Students with Serious Emotional Disturbance 

During the 1992-93 school year, a total of 402,668 children and youth from age 6 
through 21 identified as having SED were served under the Part B and Chapter 1 (SOP) 
programs accounting for 8.7 percent of all children who received special education 
services. Of those students, 368,545 students (91.5 percen v re served solely under 
Part B. Students served under Chapter 1 (SOP) were 18.8 peuent of all 6- through 21- 
year-olds served by that program. As shown in figure 4.1, of the total number of 
students with SED served under Part B during 1992-93, 35 percent were age 6-11, 60 
percent were age 12-17, and 5 percent were age 18-21. In comparison, for all disabilities 
combined, 52 percent were age 6-11; 43 percent were age 12-17, and about 5 percent 
were age 18-21. 

Since the 1976-77 school year, the number of students identified as having SED has 
increased by more than 120,000. An increase of 1 percent occurred between the 1991-92 
and 1992-93 school years. As a percentage of all students with disabilities served, the 
percent with SED served under Part B has increased from 7.5 percent in 1976-77 to 8.3 
percent in 1992-93.

Identification rates for students with SED vary widely among the States. 1 Identification 
rates ranged from 0.03 percent for Mississippi to 1.7 percent in Connecticut. Overall, 
about a third of the States have identification rates that range from 0.4 percent to 0.6 
percent of their school-age population, and a fourth have rates of 0.7 percent or higher. 
Significant variation within States in identification rates has been reported by Knitzer, 
Steinberg, and Fleisch (1990), who cited studies in Texas and Kentucky indicating that 
one-third of the school districts did not identify any students with SED during the 1987- 
88 school year. 

Even the most conservative estimates from current epidemiologic research suggest that 
between 7-8 percent of all school-age children and youth may have emotional or 
behavioral disorders severe enough to require treatment (Brandenburg, Friedman, & 
Silver, 1990; Forness, Kavale, & Lopez, 1993). Additional estimates suggest that 
between one-third and one-half of these students would have academic or educational

problems requiring special education (Forness, Bennett, & Tose, 1983). Other estimates 
quoted by the National Institute of Medicine and the Office of Technology Assessment 
state that more than 3 percent of children and youth have severe emotional disturbance 
(Koyangi & Gaines, 1993). 

Forness, Kavale, and Lopez (1993) suggest school personnel are reluctant to identify 
students with emotional disorders as eligible for special education unless they have 
significant academic problems and a history of school failure. There is also a lack of 
early identification and systematic intervention. The lack of personnel and services is 
also a barrier to identifying additional students. Finally, school personnel may be 
reluctant to identify students w. th troubling behaviors as students with SED who may 
be defined as disabled under Part B, because they cannot then suspend or expel such 
students. 



Demographic Characteristics 

A number of studies have shown that males are disproportionately identified as having 
SED. The National Longitudinal Transition Study (NLTS), for example, reported 68.5 
percent of all secondary students with disabilities were male. However, more than 
three-fourths (76.4 percent) of students identified as having SED were male, the highest 
proportion of males to females in any of the disability categories (Marder & Cox, 1991). 
Researchers have long noted that boys are more likely than girls to be perceived by 
teachers and school personnel as troublesome and identified as emotionally disturbed 
(Algozzine, 1979; Kelly, Bullock, & Dykes, 1977; Cullinan, Epstein, & Kauffman, 1984). 

The proportion of black students identified as having SED is also greater than their 
representation in the general population. Data from the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) 
indicate that 16 percent of all students are black, 68 percent are white, and 12 percent 
are Hispanic, (OCR, 1993). According to the NLTS data, 25 percent of all students with 
SED were identified as black, while 67 percent were white and 6 percent were Hispanic 
(Marder & Cox, 1991). Data reported by Knitzer, Steinberg, and Fleisch (1990) also 
indicate that several State and local districts have black students disproportionately 
represented in classes for students with SED. For example, in 1983 in New York City, 
black children represented 37 percent of the total school population but accounted for 
56 percent of the students in programs for students with emotional disturbance, and 
in 1989 Minnesota estimated a 400 percent overrepresentation of black students in 
programs for students with emotional disturbance. 

Kelly, Bullock, and Dykes (1977) found that teachers were twice as likely to identify 
black students as having emotional disturbance as they were to identify white students 
as having emotional disturbance. A study by Prieto and Zucker (1981) indicated that 
Hispanic students were also more likely than whites to be identified as having SED. 
The 1975 case Lora et al v. Board of Education of the City of New York was brought on 
behalf of black and Hispanic students who were considered to be inappropriately

placed in segregated special day schools for students with emotioral disturbance. The 
court found that the assessment procedures being used by the schools were inadequate 
and discriminatory and ordered the retraining of teachers (Wood, Johnson, & Jenkins, 
1986). 

Students identified as having SED are aLo more likely to come from lower 
socioeconomic groups (Frazier & DeBlassie, 1984; Bernard & Clarizio, 1981; Touliatos 
& Lindholm, 1980). These studies are consistent with the overall data for socioeconomic 
status and students with disabilities, which indicate that more than a third (39 percent) 
come from single-parent families and 68 percent are from homes with annual 
household incomes of less than $25,000 (Marder & Cox, 1991). 

The gender, racial, and socioeconomic differences reported for students identified as 
having SED have been attributed to a number of factors. Some studies have noted that 
it is not unreasonable to expect students from homes with low socioeconomic status to 
experience increased occurrences of developmental delays and disabilities, given the 
lack of adequate prenatal and health care and poor nutrition (Children's Defense Fund, 
1991; Davis, 1993). Stresses in the home attributable to poverty may also lead children 
to have emotional and behavioral problems in school 



School Performance and Results 

Students identified as having SED have lower grades than any other group of students 
with disabilities, fail more courses, are often retained in grade, and pass minimum 
competency tests at lower rates than other students with disabilities, according to 
Koyangi and Gaines (1993). Data from the NLTS indicate that the overall grade point 
average of 9th grade students identified as having SED is 1.7, compared with 2.0 for all 
students with disabilities. Furthermore, well over half of students with SED fail at least 
one class in grades 9 through 11. Cumulatively, 77 percent of students with SED fail 
at least one class during high school (Wagner, Blackorby, & Hebbeler, 1993). 

Dropout rates for students with SED are the highest of any disability category. Data 
from several sources indicate that between 43 and 50 percent drop out, in contrast to 
about 27 to 32 percent of all students with disabilities and between 14 and 28 percent 
of all students. About 17 percent of youth with SED go on to college or vocational 
schools within two years after leaving high school, compared with 53 percent of 
students without disabilities and 14 percent of all students with disabilities (Marder, 
1992). Students with SED also have difficulty maintaining jobs. For example, data from 
NLTS indicate that two years after leaving school, only 41 percent of the students with 
SED were employed, compared with 59 percent of the general population. Three to five 
years later, 47 percent of SED students held a job, compared with 69 percent of students 
without disabilities (D'Amico & Blackorby, 1992). 

Another measure is the NLTS profiles of independence. These profiles are based on 
three domains: engagement (employment, job training, postsecondary work); social 
(marriage, seeing friends, belonging to a group); and residential (living independently 



q 114 16th Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 4 



or in supported or institutional settings). When used to assess independence after 
school exit, these profiles show that within two years of leaving high school, only 34 
percent of all students with SED are independent in two or three domains. However, 
three to five years after school exit, the figure improves to 62 percent (Wagner, 1992b). 

About a fifth of the young people classified as having SED have been arrested while 
still in secondary school By two years after high school, 37 percent have been arrested. 
Three to five years after high school, over half (58 percent) have been arrested, an arrest 
record two and one-half times that of youth in the general population (Wagner, 1992a). 
By two years after school exit, 2.4 percent of the students with SED are living in a 
correctional facility, compared with 0.3 percent of all ycuth with disabilities (Newman, 
1991). 

Whether the poor school performance of students with SED is a result of inadequate 
educational programs or of specific student characteristics is debatable. Forness, 
Kavale, and Lopez (1993), in a California study involving 111 children who were 
receiving inpatient or outpatient psychiatric services, found that only one-third of the 
students were identified as eligible for special education and that those students were 
the most deficient in academic skills. Knitzer, Steinberg, and Fleisch (1990) noted that 
programs for students with SED overemphasize behavior management and control - 
often to the exclusion of teaching academic subject matter or providing prevocational 
or vocational training. 



Settings and Services 
Settings 

Students with SED are far more likely than any other group of students with disabilities 
to be served in special educational programs that are outside regular schools. During 
the 1991-92 school year, almost 20 percent of students with SED were served in special 
schools, other separate facilities, or homebound /hospital settings, compared with 5 
percent of students with other disabilities. Half of all students with disabilities in 
residential programs and about a fifth of all students in day schools were diagnosed 
as having SED (Koyangi & Gaines, 1993). Thirty percent of all students receiving 
homebound instruction were identified as having SED. Further, there is evidence that 
some school districts are using homebound instruction for students with SED not as a 
crisis stabilization tool, but rather as a long-term service delivery system that provides 
only about six hours of instruction per week (Leone & McLaughlin, in press). 

The percentage of students with SED .served in regular schools has decreased by about 
4 percent since 1977-78. However, this trend has stopped in recent years. For those 
students with SED who received special education in the regular school building during 
the 1991-92 school year, 37 percent were served in separate classrooms and 28 percent 
were in resource rooms. Only about 16 percent were served in regular classrooms. 
These percentages have changed little since 1985-86. Thus, while schools are not 



162 



16m Annual Repoar To Congress: Chapter 4 



placing more students with SED in separate schools, they are also not increasing their 
level of participation in regular classes. 



Services 

Many communities lack a comprehensive and coordinated system of services that can 
respond to the multiple needs of students with SED. Often, schools rely on residential 
and other restrictive placements because their communities lack other alternatives or 
because mental health services for children are lacking or are not linked to education 
(Epstein, Nelson, Polsgrove, Coutinho, Cumblad, & Quinn, 1993; Koyangi & Gaines, 
1993). Behar (1990) estimates that 50 percent or more of the children in residential care 
were placed because their communities lacked a full array of alternative services. While 
some State educational agencies and local school districts provide some services, such 
as family counseling or psychiatric treatment, as "related services," other locales view 
these as medical services or as unrelated to special education. As a result, the 
availability of mental health and other social services is inconsistent across the country. 
Data on the effectiveness of psychiatric hospitalization and residential placements are 
inconclusive (Epstein et ah, 1993), and the effectiveness of traditional or non-integrated 
mental health services is questionable. Many children and youth with SED experience 
mental health, social, and educational problems requiring a coordinated response. In 
the absence of such programs, schools are relying on costly and segregated placements 
and services. 

The cost of providing the various services is enormous. The National Institute of 
Medicine (1989) estimated that, in 1985, the cost of providing direct mental health 
services to children under age 14 was more than $1.5 billion. About $1 billion is spent 
annually for residential treatment and psychiatric hospitalization of children (Yelton, 
1991). Epstein et al. (1993) cite a survey of 37 States, reporting that the cost of serving 
4,000 youths placed outside their homes was $204 million - an average of $50,000 per 
youth. 

A number of problems are associated with these restrictive placements. Frequently, the 
distance between the home community and the residential site makes it difficult to 
monitor student progress (Epstein et al., 1993). In addition, there is little continuity in 
school programming, and often the student's public school is only minimally involved 
in the ongoing assessment of progress. The student is removed from his or her home, 
and community and family members are rarely involved in the student's program. Yet 
after the student is "treated." he or she is expected to return to the old community and 
school and maintain new learned behaviors or skills. Further, Vandenberg (1989) 
suggests that because the financial contingencies are great for those who provide the 
residential services, these individuals often are not wholly objective when assessing 
student progress.

Inadequate Public School Programs 



In addition to the lack of related services in the public schools, Knitzer, Steinberg, and 
Fleisch (1990) found a number of problems with the educational programs offered 
students with SED. Even in exemplary programs, there was a lack of emphasis on 
academic and vocational programs and an over-emphasis on behavior management and 
control Despite the alleged lack of social skills of many of these students, there were 
limited or no opportunities for students with SED to interact with non-SED peers 
through sports, recess, or other cooperative arrangements. There was little coordination 
of programming across public and private settings, and educational approaches often 
were fragmented. 

Kauffman and his colleagues (e.g., Hallenbeck, Kauffman, & Lloyd, 1993; Kauffman & 
Lloyd, 1992; Peacock Hill Working Group, 1991) have suggested that it is just such 
inadequate public school education programs that result in more restrictive placements 
settings. In particular, they cite the lack of well-planned interventions, including the 
lack of a controlled and carefully monitored school program. Such structured 
environments, they assert, are critical to the success of many students with emotional 
and behavioral disorders. Yet they found that school programs lacked structure and 
were perhaps contributing to escalation of behavior problems. These authors, as well 
as others (Patterson, Reid, & Dishion, 1992), have also stressed the need for early 
identification, prevention, and intervention services for youngsters who enter school 
already exhibiting antisocial behavior or other emotional or conduct disorders. Without 
early and powerful intervention, many of these children have a greater probability of 
being placed in residential treatment. 

A NATIONAL AGENDA FOR STUDENTS WITH SERIOUS EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE 

The 1990 Amendments to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 
created Programs for Children and Youth with Serious Emotional Disturbance. 
Congress called for initiatives that would expand existing service delivery models, 
address the needs of children with serious emotional disturbance from racially, 
ethnically, and linguistically diverse backgrounds, and promote parent advocacy. 
Congress also urged greater coordination among agencies serving children and youth 
with SED, sought a reduction in residential or out-of-ccmmunity placements, and urged 
greater focus on prevention. 

IDEA also mandated a participatory planning process, involving multiple stakeholders, 
to develop program goals, objectives, strategies, and priorities for all programs 
administered by OSEP, including Programs for Children and Youth with Serious 
Emotional Disturbance. 

OSEP defined its organizational mission as "achieving better results for individuals with 
disabilities" and identified four initial goals listed below: 



ERLC 



164 



16m Annual Report To Congkss: Chapter 4 11 



• Provide and maintain an adequate number of qualified 
personnel. 

• Develop the capacity to ready systems to meet the needs of 
changing populations. 

• Secure and expand access and inclusion for children with 
disabilities. 

• Identify measures and improve results for individuals with 
disabilities. 

OSEP used the initial goals to implement a strategic planning process that had the three 
objectives described below: 

• Develop a national agenda that would focus the attention of 
educators, parents, advocates, and professionals from a variety 
of disciplines on what must be done to encourage, assist, and 
support our nation's schools in their efforts to achieve better 
results for children and youth with SED. 

• Provide recommendations for Division of Innovation and 
Development (DID) initiatives and funding opportunities 
aimed at providing better results for children and youth with 
SED. 

• Provide background for Programs for Children and Youth with 
Serious Emotional Disturbance. 

Working with Project FORUM at the National Association of State Directors of Special 
Education, DID designed a process enabling identification of strategic targets that 
would guide the work of OSEP as well as States, local schools and communities. The 
process included focus groups that developed initial statements or targets and then 
extensively revised and validated those targets. Five focus statements were defined 
through this initial process 

An electronic town meeting was held to obtain reactions to the focus statements. The 
Council for Exceptional Children collaborated with DID to sponsor a national 
teleconference on July 25, 1991, linking eight local conferences (in Los Angeles, 
California; Washington, D.C.; St. Petersburg, Florida; Bloomington, Indiana; Jefferson 
City, Missouri; Denton, Texas; Logan, Utah; and Charlottesville, Virginia) for interactive 
discussions. An additional 50 sites received the broadcast or taped the conference for 
later viewing. 

After the teleconference, DID received more than 1,400 comment* on the focus 
statements. In general, comments supported OSEP's mission statement but refined the 
focus statements. During 1991 and 1992, representatives fiom OSEP and Project

FORUM presented preliminary results of their efforts at a number of conferences and 
meetings and obtained more commentary. 

Since a 1992 contract award under Programs for Children and Youth with Serious 
Emotional Disturbance, the Chesapeake Institute has endeavored to conclude the 
agenda-building process by refining, contfrming, and developing target statements 
based on the 1991 statements, and by designing and implementing a process that would 
validate those targets. The process has included focus groups consisting of all relevant 
stakeholders, interviews and phone panels, literature and document reviews, reviews 
of OSEP-funded initiatives, and general outreach to stakeholder groups. 



Strategic Targets and Cross-Cutting Themes 

Significantly improving results for children and youth with SED requires a vision of 
transformed service systems, reoriented professional attitudes, and an emphasis on 
positive results. Toward these ends, OSEP and the participants in the planning process 
have identified the following seven interdependent strategic targets: 

Target 1 Expand Positive Learning Opportunities and Results - To foster the provision of 
engaging, useful, and positive learning opportunities. These opportunities 
should be result-driven and should acknowledge as well as respond to the 
experiences and needs of children and youth with serious emotional 
disturbance. 

Target 2 Strengthen School and Community Capacity - To foster initiatives that strengthen 
the capacity of schools and communities to serve students with serious 
emotional disturbance in the least restrictive environments appropriate. 



Target 3 Value and Address Diversity - To encourage culturally competent and 
linguistically appropriate exchanges and collaborations among families, 
professionals, students, and communities. These collaborations should foster 
equitable outcomes for all students and result in the identification and 
provision of services that are responsive to issues of race, culture, gender, and 
social and economic status. 

Target 4 Collaborate with Families - To foster collaborations that fully include family 
members on the team of service providers that implements family-focused 
services to improve educational outcomes. Services should be open, helpful, 
culturally competent, accessible to families, and school-based as well as 
community-based. 

Target 5 Promote Appropriate Assessment - To promote practices ensuring that 
assessment is integral to the identification, design, and delivery of services for 
children and youth with SED. These practices should be culturally 
appropriate, ethical, and functional. 



166 

16th Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 4 

eric 



Target 6 Provide Ongoing Skill Development and Support - To foster the enhancement of 
knowledge, understanding, and sensitivity among all who work with children 
and youth who have or who are at risk of developing SED. Support and 
development should be ongoing and should aim at strengthening the capacity 
of families, teachers, service providers, and other stakeholders to collaborate, 
persevere, and improve outcomes for children and youth with SED. 

Target 7 Create Comprehensive and Collaborative Systems - To promote systems change 
resulting in the development of coherent services built around the individual 
needs of children and youth who have or who are at risk of developing SED. 
These services should be family-centered, community-based, and 
appropriately funded. 

Underlying the seven targets are several key assumptions that embody an 
understanding that a flexible and proactive continuum of services must be built around 
the needs of children with SED and their families. Furthermore, it is not enough that 
services be available. They must also be sustained and comprehensive, and they must 
collaboratively engage families, service providers, and children and youth with SED. 
Finally, both the needs of these children and the increasing demographic diversity of 
our nation call for cross-agency, school- and community-based relationships that are 
characterized by mutual respect and accountability - with the welfare of the child 
always the central concern. Accordingly, OSEP identified the following three 
cross-cutting themes that reflect this understanding: 

• Collaborative efforts must extend to initiatives that prevent SED 
from developing or escalating. 

• Services must be provided in a culturally sensitive and respectful 
manner. 

• Services must empower all stakeholders and maintain a climate 
of possibility and accountability. 

The seven strategic targets developed for the national agenda for children and youth 
with SED are linked. Each target can be best understood and implemented in concert 
with the other targets and in the context of a collaborative process. Achieving 
successful results for children and youth with SED depends on pursuing and attaining 
all of the strategic targets. 



DISCRETIONARY PROGRAMS FOR STUDENTS WITH SERIOUS EMOTIONAL 
DISTURBANCE 

The Programs for Children and Youth with Serious Emotional Disturbance enables 
OSEP to support a number of projects that focus on improving educational 
opportunities for students with SED and reflect the strategic targets embedded in the 
national agenda. These include research projects, model development, policy 



120 



16m Annual Rcport To Congress: Chapter 4 




167 



development, and personnel preparation. Although OSEP supports other research, and 
model demonstration projects that address the area of SED, the Programs for Children 
and Youth with Serious Emotional Disturbance is targeted specifically to the SED 
population. 



School Preparedness for Promoting the Personal and Social Development of 
Students with Emotional and Behavioral Problems, Including Those with Serious 
Emotional Disturbance 

The purpose of this priority is to provide support for demonstration projects that help 
prepare students for post-school success. Such projects help reorient and prepare 
schools, in collaboration with families and with providers of support service, to deliver 
schoolwide, proactive, positively-oriented curricula, instruction, and support services 
to assist students with emotional and behavioral problems - including SED - to exit 
schools prepared to meet the personal and social demands of post-school environments. 

Project activities include: 

• identifying and defining outcomes; 

• preparing designs for reorienting and developing school 
capacity; 

• developing curricula (spanning all grades within a building); 

• implementing school capacity-building initiatives (curricula, 
instruction, and support services); 

• assessing the feasibility of the design and the effectiveness of 
implementation for enhancing school capacity; and 

• disseminating project findings. 

Three projects have been funded under this priority. 



Strategic Planning for Improving Outcomes for Children and Youth with Serious 
Emotional Disturbance 

The purpose of this priority is to provide DID with analysis and support to help 
validate and complete its strategic planning process for children and youth with SED. 
The project being completed by the Chesapeake Institute under a three-year contract 
includes tire following tasks: 



168

Refining strategic targets. Staff have analyzed and prepared 
labels, target statements, and research-based context statements 
for the strategic agenda. 

Designing and implementing focus groups to validate draft 
strategic targets. Staff have prepared guides and support 
material and have organized focus groups to validate the 
proposed agenda. 

Researching and writing a strategic planning process. 



Development and Support for Enhancing Professional Knowledge, Skills, and 
Strategies 

The purpose of this priority is to provide support for research projects to improve 
special education and related services to children and youth with SED. Project activities 
must develop the knowledge, skills, and strategies for effective collaboration among 
special education, regular education, related services, and other professionals and 
agencies. 

Within the absolute priority, Uiere are several invitational elements. Some are projects 
in which research is conducted on providing training and support for education, mental 
health, social w ork, and other relevant personnel who are providing services to children 
and youth with SED. Others include: 

• identifying the knowledge and skills needed by "post-entry" 
personnel to enhance collaboration and provide improved 
services to children and youth with SED; 

• testing staff development methods to impart the identified 
knowledge and skills to post-entry personnel; and 

• testing staff development, organizational approaches, and other 
strategies to decrease professional burnout and attrition and to 
promote motivation, a sense of empowerment, and continuing 
commitment to achieving better results for children and youth 
with SED. 

Ten projects have bc j n funded under this priority. 



Facilitating Interagency and Private Sector Resource Efforts to Improve Services 

This priority provides support to LEAs collaborating with mental health entities to 
create demonstration projects providing services for children and youth with SED. 
Projects must have the four aims described below: 




122 16th Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 4 

169 



• to increase the availability, access, and quality of community 
services for children and youth with SED and their families; 

• to improve working relationships among education, school, 
and community mental health and other relevant personnel, 
families of children and youth with SED, and their advocates; 

• to target resources to school settings, such as providing access 
to school and community mental health professionals and other 
community resources for students with SED who are in 
community school settings; and 

• to take into account the needs of minority children and youth 
in all phases of project activity. 

Within the absolute priority, the Secretary has announced an invitational priority to 
encourage projects to include; 

• determining the range, nature, and frequency of educational 
and other needs of children with SED and their families; 

• reviewing and analyzing current programs and services; 

. • identifying systemic issues that must be addressed in order to 

develop a comprehensive system of education and support for 
children with SED and their families; 

• identifying system improvements and the criteria used for their 
selection; 

• determining the capacity and readiness to implement each 
targeted system improvement; and 

• assessing the likelihood that a given project, if implemented, 
would improve education and support services, be responsive 
to diverse and changing needs, be coordinated, and be 
provided in a manner that would ensure continuity in meeting 
the needs of children with SED and their families. 



Twenty-three school districts have received grants from OSEP unde; this priority to 
develop comprehensive systems of education and support for children with SED. The 
grants went to LE As collaborating with mental health agencies to design comprehensive 
community-based systems.

Reducing Out-of-Community Programs by Improving Services to Children with 
Serious Emotional Disturbance and Their Families 



This priority provides support for projects to improve services to children and youth 
with SED. Projects must develop and demonstrate strategies and approaches to reduce 
the use of out-of-comm unity residential programs and to encourage the increased use 
of school-district-based programs (which may include day treatment programs, after- 
school programs, and summer programs). 

Within this priority, the Secretary particularly encourages projects that provide family- 
friendly services - projects enabling families to maintain children with SED at home 
and in their school and community. Particularly encouraged is the development of 
community-based alliances that promote collective responsibility and support for 
families. 

Projects were encouraged that focus on the following goals: 

• Identify the characteristics of family-friendly services that are 
needed to support families with children with SED and 
maintain them ir their home, school, and community. 

• Identify the improvements needed in the current community 
and supporting environment required to create family-friendly 
services. 

• Develop a plan, including strategies for implementing family- 
friendly services. 

• Through the family /community alliances, implement the plan 
and strategies for creating family-friendly services. 

• Identify "lessons learned" from planning and implementing 
community-based family-friendly services. 

• Develop and implement an outreach and dissemination plan 
for the purpose of sharing with other communities what 
families need for effective support. 

• Plan for continued provision of their services through State and 
local support rather than Federal support. 

Seven projects have been funded under this priority.

Preparation of Personnel for Careers in Special Education, Serious Emotional 
Disturbance 

The purpose of the Preparation of Personnel for Careers in Special Education, Serious 
Emotional Disturbance program is to increase the quantity and improve the quality of 
personnel available to serve infants, toddlers, children, and youth with SED. This 
program supports preservice preparation for special education teachers, 
speech/language pathologists, audiologists, adapted physical education teachers, 
vocational educators, and instructive assistive technology specialists at the 
baccalaureate, masters, and specialist levels. Also, certified teachers seeking additional 
degrees, certification, or endorsements in the area of SED may be trained under this 
program. 

Four projects offer collaborative training with mainstream teachers. Two projects 
specifically tar£<?t rural communities. One prepares specialists to work with families 
both in local puolic schools and in local communities. Another proposed project is a 
training program preparing individuals to work with culturally diverse youth in 
correctional facilities. 



SUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS 

State and local educational agencies face significant challenges in providing special 
education to students with SED. Two serious challenges are the extent of the needs of 
these students and their families and the lack of a full range of mental health services 
and other social and human services in many communities. Other issues include the 
States' varying interpretations of the number and nature of students included under the 
statutory definition of SED, and concerns about the high disproportion of three groups: 
males, students from minority backgrounds, and students from families in the lower 
socioeconomic levels. The final - and all-embracing - challenge is that post-school 
results for students with SED suggest that existing programs may not be providing 
sufficient academic and vocational education to permit successful transition into 
adulthood. 

Despite these challenges, a number of innovative and promising initiatives are being 
implemented across the United States. These initiatives are increasing collaboration 
among agencies as well as helping school districts define the critical elements of 
comprehensive and flexible service systems. Family advocacy activities are increasing, 
and family input is becoming part of these new service systems. Special education 
services are being examined to ensure that they not only address emotional and 
behavioral problems, but also provide a broad and balanced set of educational 
experiences, OSEP continues to support research activities that reflect the best practices 
in the field, including focusing on school- and community-based service models. Thus, 
while much remains to be done, the new national efforts appear to be producing some 
promising improvements in the results of students with SED.

Results For Students With Disabilities 

This chapter reports on the work of the National Center on Education?* Outcomes 
(NCEO), one of several research centers funded by OSERS. The views expressed here are 
those of NCEO, and do not necessarily represent the views of ihe Department of 
Education. 

Recently the nation has become more concerned about student performance, students' 
lack of preparation for employment, and students' level of performance in comparison 
with students in other nations. Another concern is also growing. There is very little 
information about educational results for students with disabilities. This is particularly 
significant because students with disabilities represent a steadily increasing proportion 
of students overall. 

The nation has sev ?ral programs for collecting education data, and States have their 
own assessments, yet the problem persists. There are two main reasons. First, students 
with disabilities are sometimes excluded from assessments. Second, assessors have 
sometimes failed to provide appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities. 
An additional factor is that variations in terminology and in reporting methods often 
complicate the task of analyzing the data that are available. 

In 1990, the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) funded the National Center 
on Educational Outcomes (NCEO) to address issues related to assessing educational 
results for students with disabilities. NCEO's mission has been to help develop 
indicators of educational results for students with disabilities. To accomplish this 
mission, NCEO surveys States annually about their assessment activities, and it works 
with State and Federal agencies to compile information on educational results for 
students with disabilities from existing data bases. This chapter describes NCEO's 
conceptual model of outcomes, including its congruence with State-identified goals and 
national data collection programs; identifies the educational results data currently 
collected nationally and by States; and discusses exclusion of students with disabilities 
in State and national assessments. 



CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF OUTCOMES 

Despite rhetoric about educational results, the student results measurements conducted 
nationally and by States have been relatively narrow in scope. The nation's Governors 
and the President have identified six national education goals to be reached by the year 
2000 (NEGP, 1991). While these goals covered diverse topics - such as readiness for 
school, graduation rates, adult literacy, and violence and discipline in schools - the 
most attention was devoted to Goals 3 and 4, which address achievement in core 



177

ERIC 



academic content areas, particularly science and math. State assessment sysknvs, 
similarly, have focused almost entirely on assessing academic achievement. 

Yet people clearly are interested in other educational results, and different groups have 
described a wide variety of indicators. For example, in a document entitled What Work 
Requires of Schools, the Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS, 
1991) identified a three-part foundation (basic skills, thinking skills, and personal 
qualities) and five competencies (resources, interpersonal, information, systems, and 
technology) as constituting "workplace know-how," which in turn determines effective 
job performance. In Education Counts, the Special Study Panel on Education Indicators 
(1991) identified four other indicators of educational results - achievement, attainment, 
postsecondary experiences, and beyond-school experiences. The American Public 
Welfare Association (1991), in collaboration with the Council of Chief State School 
Officers, produced Joining Forces, which identified results in the areas of physical health 
and safety, social/ emotional, cognitive/academic, and productivity /employment. None 
of these groups, however, adequately addressed results for students with disabilities. 

To develop its model, NCEO began by working with a broad range of stakeholders - 
including State education administrators, professional associations, parents, and 
advocacy groups. The result is a comprehensive conceptual model of outcomes, along 
with documents that identify the outcomes and their indicators at six developmental 
levels (ages 3 and 6, grades 4, 8, and 12, and post-school). The basic conceptual model 
at the time of graduation is provided in figure 5.1. It shows that educational resources 
(input and context) influence educational opportunity and process, which in turn 
influence the eight domains. The domains, in return, influence both the resources and 
the opportunity and process. 

NCEO and the stakeholders first defined the terms 'outcome" and "indicator." After 
reviewing definitions proposed in the professional literature by researchers and policy 
makers, the group reached consensus on the following definitions: 

Outcome = The result of interactions among individuals and educational experiences. 

Indicator = A symbolic representation of one or more educational outcomes for 
infants, children, and youth that enables comparisons to be made. 

The group also defined the key terms within these definitions (Ysseldyke, Thurlow, 
Bruininks, Deno, McGrew, & Shriner, 1991) and developed a set of assumptions to 
guide the process of identifying outcomes and indicators (see table 5.1). For a 
description of the overall process, see Developing a Model of Educational Outcomes 
(Ysseldyke & Thurlow, 1993a). 

With the definitions and assumptions established, NCEO held meetings to identify 
outcomes and indicators within the eight domains. Again, the process was one of 
establishing consensus (Vanderwood, Ysseldyke, & Thurlow, 1993). The eight domain 
definitions are presented in table 5.2.

Table 5.1 Assumptions Guiding the NCEO Development of 
Educational Outcomes and indicators 



Model of Outcomes 

1. A model of outcomes is needed for all students, and at the broadest level 
should apply to all students regardless of the characteristics of individuals. 



Outcome Indicators 

2. Indicators of outcomes for students receiving special education services 
should be related, conceptually and . 'atistically, to those identified for 
students without disabilities. 

3. Indicators should be unbiased with respect to gender, culture, race, and 
other characteristics of the diversity of students in today's school 
population. 

4. While indicators should meet research standards, those that do not could 
still be used. 



Comprehensive System of Indicators 

5. A comprehensive system of indicators should provide data needed to 
make policy decisions at the State and national levels. 

6. A comprehensive system of indicators should to the maximum extent 
possible be based on demonstrated functional relationships between 
outcome indicators and indicators of educational inputs, contextual 
characteristics, and processes; however, valued indicators may be included 
even if functional relationships have not been established. 

7. A comprehensive system of indicators should be flexible, dynamic, and 
responsive to review and criticism, changing to meet identified needs and 
future developments in the measurement of inputs, contexts, processes, 
and outcomes.

At the level of school completion, 25 NCEO outcomes were identified across the eight 
domains. For each NCEO outcome, from one to six indicators were identified, and 
possible sources of data or other information were identified for each indicator. The 
25 NCEO outcomes and 77 indicators are listed in table 5.3. 



Congruence with State Goals 

After completing the conceptual model, NCEO compared it with educational goals and 
results identified by a sample of 17 States to see how closely the model corresponded 
with the States' expected results. In general, there was considerable correspondence 
between the NCEO model and State expected results . 

As shown in table 5.4, each of the NCEO domains was addressed by at least two of the 
sample States. The Academic and Functional Literacy domain was included in all 17 
States' lists of expected results. The other domains frequently addressed by the States 
were: 

• Personal and Social Adjustment (14 States) 

• Contribution and Citizenship (13 States) 

• Physical Health (12 States) 

• Responsibility and Independence (12 States) 

Satisfaction was addressed by only two States, and Accommodation and Adaptation by 
only three. States ranged from having goals that matched two of NCEO's domains 
(Colorado and Louisiana) to having goals in all eight domains (Indiana). The number 
of domains most frequently addressed by States was five. 

NCEO also found a high degree of overlap between States' goals and the 25 NCEO 
outcomes at the level of graduation. When States had a goal that matched an NCEO 
domain, they often matched several, if not all, of the related NCEO outcomes also (see 
table 5.5). For example, of the 10 States that had any goal in the Presence and 
Participation domain (Domain A), 6 had goals that matched all three NCEO outcomes 
in that domain. Of the 12 States that had a goal addressed by Domain D 
(Responsibility and Independence), 7 had goals in both of the NCEO outcomes in that 
domain. For Domain H (Satisfaction), both States that had goals addressing this 
domain also had goals in the three NCEO outcomes. There were few State goals that 
were not addressed in NCEO's model. One was development of creativity. 

Overall, the States' lists of goals and expectations matched closely the NCEO model 
for graduating students. This congruence illustrates that many States are already 
emphasizing results in education. However, most States are not yet collecting data on 
these results. Even for those results on which States are collecting data for all students, 
there remain two barriers to reliable data on results for students with disabilities - the

exclusion of many such students, and the inability to separate their data from that of 
other students. 



Congruence with National Data Collection Programs 

The United States has numerous national data collection programs supported by 
different Federal agencies. Nearly 30 of these programs collect information potentially 
related to the areas identified in the NCEO model. To determine the extent to which 
these national programs include factors that are also indicators of school completion 
results, NCEO compared its school completion model with data elements in a sample 
of 13 of the national programs that include individuals at the time of graduation: 

• Current Population Survey (CPS) 

• High School Transcript Study, 1990 (HSTS) 

• Monitoring the Future, 1993 (MF) 

• National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) 

• National Adult Literacy Survey, 1992 (NALS) 

• National Crime Survey, 1986-89 (NCS) 

• National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988, Second Follow- 
up (NELS) 

National Household Education Survey, 1991 (NHES) 

• National Health Interview Survey, 1988 (NHIS) 
National Household Survey of Drug Abuse, 1993 (NHSDA) 

• National Longitudinal Transition Study of Special Education 
Students, 1987 (NLTS) 

• National Survey of Family Growth, 1988 (NSFG) 

• Youth Risk Behavior Survey, 1993 (YRBS) 

As might be expected given the different purposes of the data collection programs, 
some measures correspond more closely than others to the NCEO domains (see 
table 5.6). The domains least likely to have data available in a national data collection 
program are the Accommodation and Adaptation domain and the Satisfaction domain, 
both of which had data available in only two of the 13 data collection programs. The 
National Education Longitudinal Survey (NELS) was the only data collection program 
that collected information related to all eight NCEO domains.

148 16m Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 5 



Correspondence between the NCEO model indicators and the information collected 
through national data collection programs is portrayed in table 5.7. Across the 13 data 
collection programs, 91 percent (70 of 77) of the NCEO indicators were represented by 
at least one measure in a national data collection program. When the National 
Longitudinal Transition Study of Special Education Students (which is a non-recurnng 
study) is excluded, the coverage is still approximately 81 percent. These relatively high 
levels of correspondence clearly suggest the potential for producing comprehensive and 
conceptually-organized information on the status of students in the general population 
as they complete school. Unfortunately, because of the problems of exclusion from 
assessments and lack of accommodations, these data collection programs provide little 
useful data on the educational results of students with disabilities. 

DATA FROM NATIONAL DATA COLLECTION PROGRAMS 

In its attempts to use national data collection programs to identify the outcomes of 
education for students with disabilities, NCEO encountered serious barriers. One 
barrier was that students with disabilities were largely excluded from the assessment 
programs. Another was that terminology for and grouping of students with disabilities 
were inconsistent from program to program. 

Exclusion of Students with Disabilities in National Data Collection Programs 

Initially, NCEO analyzed nine data collection programs: 

Current Population Survey (CPS) 

Longitudinal Survey of American Youth (LSAY) 

National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), 1988 

National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), Trial 
State Assessment 

National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), 1990 
National Adult Literacy Survey (NALS) 
National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS) 
National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)

a/ Data collection programs are identified in table 5.6.

16m Annual Report To Congress: Chapter S 

204 




This preliminary analysis revealed that the data collection programs tended either 
to include individuals with disabilities (e.g., NHIS, NHEFS, CPS) or to exclude from 
one-third to one-half of individuals with disabilities (e.g., 1988 NAEP, Trial State 
NAEP, 1990 NAEP, NELS). 

Further analysis indicated that data collection programs that rely on interviews or 
surveys of informed respondents showed lower exclusion rates. In contrast, data 
collection programs that require individuals themselves to respond to actual test 
items or survey instruments show relatively high exclusion rates. 

Usually, exclusion occurs as a result of guidelines that were formulated out of 
concern for individuals who are unable to participate meaningfully in the 
assessment because of their disability. 



Exclusion Guidelines 

NCEO researchers examined guidelines regarding exclusion (or inclusion) of 
students with disabilities. Although specific guidelines may exist, implementation 
is rarely monitored and often is inconsistent. In fact, information gathered from the 
NAEP Trial State Assessment and the first NELS assessments suggests that 
exclusion guidelines may be inconsistently applied even within a single data 
collection program. For example, in the NAEP Trial State Assessment, the design 
procedures and exclusion guidelines used in each State were the same as those in 
the national NAEP. Even under these controlled guidelines, however, the rate of 
exclusion of students with disabilities ranged from 33 percent in one State to 87 
percent in another. 

A follow-up study of students determined to be ineligible for the NELS base year 
data collection (Ingels, 1991) has provided important insights into the exclusion 
process. As in most data collection programs, exclusion guidelines are applied and 
related decisions made by local school staff. In the directions to local staff during 
the NELS base-year, schools were asked to apply the exclusion guidelines 
individually and not to exclude students categorically. School personnel were 
instructed to include the student if there was any uncertainty. 

The results of the NELS ineligible study indicated that these directions were not 
always followed. On some of the school sampling rosters, all students within a 
specific category were excluded. In addition, completion rates for the assessment 
were very high (99 percent), something one would not expect if borderline cases 
(i.e., students with disabilities who might not be able to participate throughout an 
entire assessment) were included in the assessments, as recommended by the 
guidelines. Further evidence that the directions were not always followed comes 
from the finding that more than half (53 percent) of the students in the NELS base- 
year ineligible sample were reclassified as eligible at *he time of the first follow-up 
two years later (Ingels, 1993). Approximately 94 percent of those who were 
reclassified were able to complete the data collection instruments successfully. 



16th Annual Report To Congress: Chapter S 153 

ERIC 205 



Exclusion of students with disabilities from national data collection programs also 
occurs in several ways that are nominally unrelated to disability. One example is 
the use of telephone interviews. Such interviews exclude households without 
telephones. Since households without telephones tend to include a higher 
percentage of low-income households, and since households with a disabled family 
member tend to have lower incomes, people with disabilities are disproportionately 
excluded from studies that rely on telephone interviewing. In addition, telephone 
surveys usually exclude people who are deaf or who use telecommunication devices 
(Kiecolt & Nathan, 1985). Thus, students with disabilities may sometimes be 
inadvertently excluded from data collection programs for reasons that are only 
incidental to their disability. 

Moreover, a substantial number of students with disabilities are excluded from 
national education surveys because special schools for individuals with disabilities 
are not included. These schools are attended by as many as 7 percent of all 
students with disabilities. In addition, students with disabilities who attend regular 
schools are excluded in some instances. For example, in some data collection 
programs ([e.g., High School and Beyond), the sample includes only students who 
are in high school programs leading to graduation and a diploma. This means that 
students in non-degree programs (such as students in special education who are 
working toward a certificate of completion) are not included in the data collection. 
Furthermore, students who cannot read or complete a questionnaire on their own 
are often excluded. This practice eliminates students who are blind or who have 
difficulty using pencils. Many large-scale assessment programs also allow the 
exclusion of students who might experience discomfort during the testing situation. 
Therefore, a substantial proportion of students with mental, emotional, and /or 
physical disabilities are excluded. 

As suspected, and confirmed in several instances (see McGill-Franzen & Allington, 
1993), exclusion also occurs for even more questionable reasons. Administrators 
may exclude students if the administrators perceive that the students' test scores 
would lower the performance levels reported for a school or a district. This kind 
of exclusion may occur more frequently if sanctions are applied to the school or 
district as a result of unacceptable levels of test performance. 



When and How Exclusion Occurs 

Exclusion occurs at the national level mostly at one or more of three stages: when 
the assessment instruments are developed; when the data are collected; and when 
results are analyzed, interpreted, and reported. Methodology reports from most 
national assessment programs include little or no description of how students with 
disabilities are included in the development phase. Furthermore, most sampling 
plans for national data collection programs assume that some students are incapable 
of participating in testing programs and systematically exclude certain segments of 
the school-age population with disabilities (such as students in residential, 
homebound, hospital, or separate school settings). 



1 54 16m Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 5 

ERIC 



The most obvious type of exclusion of students occurs during data collection. 
Reasons may range from a concern over being unable to provide proper 
accommodations to a concern that the assessment situation may be uncomfortable 
for the student. Decisions about who is excluded are typical 1 y made at the local 
level, where the school staff who make the decision understandably are concerned 
about how the overall school score may be affected. In addition, school personnel 
may not consider how useful such information can be for the development of 
educational policy. 

Exclusion during the analysis, interpretation, and reporting of results usually 
reflects a failure to disaggregate information for students with disabilities from that 
of other students. It is less likely to reflect the removal of the scores of students 
with disabilities from the results. Often, the reason given is that there are not 
enough students with disabilities to make disaggregating the results a meaningful 
endeavor. 



Inconsistencies in Identifying Information on People with Disabilities in 
National Data Collection Programs 

NCEO researchers analyzed the similarities and differences of how 19 national data 
collection programs identify students with disabilities. The programs were selected 
either because they include important indicators of educational results for students 
with disabilities or because they are highly visible programs that play a prominent 
role in current reform activities. In addition, the programs selected for analysis all 
identified students with disabilities in some manner. Of these programs, the first 
11 are supported by the Department of Education. The remaining programs are 
supported by the Department of Commerce (CPS), the Department of Health and 
Human Services, (NHIS, NHEFS, NSFG, NASHS, YRBS), the Department of Justice 
(NCS), and the National Science Foundation (LSAY). Researchers examined the 
following 19 data collection programs;

The correspondence between the 11 Federal disability categories included in this 
analysis (autism and traumatic brain injury, added in 1991, were not included) and 
the disability categories in the 19 national data collection programs are summarized 
in table 5.8. Analysis of this information revealed that disability-related 
terminology varies significantly between educational and non-educational Federal 
agencies, as well as within these agencies. The disability category for which there 
was the greatest similarity of terms across the largest number of data collection 
programs was speech or language impairments. Overall, 10 of the 19 (52.6 percent) 
data collection programs made use of a single speech-related variable. Nine of 
these programs were sponsored by the Department of Education. However, 
variation existed even within the programs sponsored by the Department of 
Education. For example, no speech impairment variable was included in the 
NELS:88 program. The NHIS:89 survey used two different speech-related categories, 
stammering/stuttering and other speech impairment. Of the eight programs 
sponsored by non-educational agencies, only one included any speech-related 
category in its data collection program.

Analysis of the learning disabilities category showed that none of the non-educational 
data collection programs actually used the term "learning disability." In contrast, 
9 of the 11 (81.8 percent) educational data collection programs included a single 
label indicating a learning disability. Overall, 10 of 19 (52,6 percent) of the data 
collection programs included a learning disability variable. In addition, one 
educational data collection program (NELS:88) used a combined category (i.e., for 
individuals with orthopedic impairments or learning disabilities) that would make 
disaggregation of the results for individuals with learning disabilities impossible. 

For the three Federal special education disability categories of mental retardation, 
deaf-blind, and multiple disabilities, either the Federal category was used or the 
disability was not categorized. Of the 19 data collection programs, 7 (36.8 percent) 
used a term for individuals with mental retardation, and 5 (26.3 percent) included 
the deaf-blind and multiple disabilities categories. With one exception (use of the 
mental retardation category in NHIS:89), all the programs that used these three 
Federal categories were under the direction of the Department of Education. 

Additional analyses revealed significant variability across data collection programs 
in the use of terms that correspond to the Federal categories of serious emotional 
disturbance, hard of hearing, deaf, visual impairment, orthopedic impairment, and other 
health impairments. In each of these analyses, researchers found single and multiple 
category variables. When multiple categories would be appropriate, such as in the 
case of the separate Federal special education categories of hard of hearing and 
deaf, only six data collection programs provided this option. Five of the six were 
under the direction of the Department of Education. However, sponsorship by the 
Department of Education did not ensure the appropriate use of two categories in 
six of their other data collection programs. With one exception (NALS:92 included 
other health impairments), only the NHIS:89 survey, directed by the National Center 
for Health Statistics, included multiple categories that appeared to correspond to a 
single Federal special education category. 

Only three of the non-educational data collection programs included any variables 
that could be matched with the Federal special education categories: LSAY, 
NHIS:89, and NHEFS:86. Such a finding is not surprising, given that the non- 
educational data collection programs were designed to address predominantly non- 
educational issues (e.g., health, crime, family growth). Some of the non-educational 
data collection programs do not gather any disability-related information (NSFG:88, 
NASHS:88, NCS:86-89, YRBS:90-91). Others gather it (e.g., NHIS:89, NHEFS:86) but 
use a different conceptual framework, such as the International Classification of 
Impairments, Disabilities, and Handicaps (ICIDH) or the "functional limitation" or 
Nagi framework (Pope & Tarlov, 1991). Correspondence between terms used in 
these other disability conceptual frameworks and the Federal disability categories 
is limited. 

Many of these non-educational data collection programs are some of the most 
inclusive national programs in terms of individuals with disabilities (McGrew, 
Thurlow, Shriner, & Spiegel, 1992). The lack of disability category variables results 




16th Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 5 159 

211 



in a significant lost opportunity for producing important policy-relevant information 
about this portion of the population. 

It is important to note that just because a data collection program includes a term 
related to the Federal disability categories does not necessarily mean that 
researchers can break out the results by the disability category. For example, the 
national and State NAEP programs (i.e., NAEP:88, TSAP:90) are listed as including 
many of the special education categories. However, this disability-related 
information was collected only for students who were excluded from the NAEP data 
collection activities. Therefore, it is impossible to disaggregate the NAEP results of 
any students with disabilities who were not excluded. 

Some data collection programs do include variables similar to the Federal disability 
categories. Even Ciese similarities, however, do not ensure that disaggregation is 
feasible. In other words, because of differences in how the data are collected and 
reported, breaking out the information according to disability category is harder 
than it seems, and in many cases impossible. 



EDUCATIONAL RESULTS DATA COLLECTED BY STATES 

NCEO annually surveys the 50 States and 9 Outlying Areas that receive Federal 
special education funds. The surveys have two purposes: 

• to create an ongoing tracking system to describe how States 
are assessing educational results, particularly those for 
students with disabilities; and 

• to work with States that have data that might be used to 
describe the educational results of students with disabilities 
nationally. In addition, NCEO is identifying persistent 
barriers to and needs of results assessment efforts, with the 
goal of providing information that will help States meet the 
needs and overcome the barriers. 

The NCEO reports Special Education Outcomes 1991 and Special Education Outcomes 
1992 provide detailed findings concerning the status of educational results 
assessment of students with disabilities. The major findings are: 

• Participation and exit data continue to be a major part of 
States' data collection efforts for students with disabilities. 
IDEA requires States to report these data to OSEP. 

• Few State-level special education data collection efforts, 
other than post-school status studies, yield results data on 
students with disabilities. 



160 16m Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 5 

212 



• State-level information on results is generated most often 
from large-scale general education assessments. Students 
with mild disabilities may participate, but the extent to 
which they participate is uncertain in most States. 

• In 1992, more States reported having accessible 
achievement data on students with disabilities than was 
true in 1990. 

• Despite State-level guidelines on who may be excluded 
from assessments and how to make testing 
accommodations for students with disabilities, variations in 
participation suggest that the criteria are implemented 
inconsistently. 

• In spite of their struggle to collect information about 
educational results, several States are exploring ways to 
adapt outcomes-based education systems. 

Assessments of educational results in the States are still in the beginning stages. 
These NCEO State reports do not contain data on educational results for students 
with disabilities because these data do not yet exist in enough States to produce a 
meaningful report. Still, important information has been obtained from the States 
about three critical issues: exclusion of students with disabilities in existing State- 
level assessment programs, identifying students in State-level assessments, and 
accommodations made to promote the participation of students with disabilities in 
State-level assessments. 



Exclusion of Students with Disabilities in State-Level Assessments 

State-level assessments mainly measure academic achievement. Of the 59 States and 
Outlying Areas surveyed in 1992, all but 9 included students with disabilities in 
their State-level achievement assessments (see figure 5.2). In the States that did 
include students with disabilities, all but two had assessments that were conducted 
by the general education assessment program, either alone or in combination with 
vocational education. Thus, most States are collecting achievement data and 
including students with disabilities, Yet the data are not accessible in all of those 
States (see figure 5.3). Even in States in which students with disabilities are 
included, nearly 20 percent cannot separate the data of students with disabilities 
from the data of other students. Beyond this, the percentage of students with 
disabilities who participate in the statewide assessments ranges from less than 10 
percent to more than 90 percent, according to States' own estimates (see table 5.9).

Exclusion Guidelines 

Guidelines regarding exclusion (or inclusion) of students with disabilities were reported 
by States. The following were the primary basis for State guidelines: 

• level of special education service; 

• amount of time in general education classes; and 

• specific student characteristics. 

Frequently, exclusion decisions were based on some undefined local decision or on a 
variety of other idiosyncratic variables. Analysis of the exclusion crteria in a sample 
of 17 States (Thurlow, Ysseldyke, & Silverstein, 1993) indicates even r ;ore complexity. 
For example, a State may have different rules for norm-referenced and criterion- 
referenced assessments. When States decide which students with special needs to 
include or exclude from testing, they typically consider criteria based on disability 
category, degree of impairment, percentage of time the student is mainstreamed, or 
percentage of time the student is receiving special services. Frequently, States consider 
more than one of the those variables. Some States look at more fine-grained variables, 




1 64 16th Annual Report To Congress: Chapter S 2X8 



such as specific courses for which the students are mainstreamed (e.g., reading or math 
versus music or art). Sometimes consideration is given to whether the student's 
instructional objectives match those measured by the test. Frequently, the opinion of 
the parent or guardian is factored into the decision about whether a particular student 
should be included in a large-scale assessment. The exclusion decision sometimes 
hinges on whether accommodations are used during assessments. Some States consider 
whether a test can be adapted to a student's special needs and still maintain its validity. 
If adaptation appears to be impossible or not feasible, the student may be excluded 
from testing. 

These differences in determining inclusion or exclusion compound the difficulty of 
comparing data from different States. 



When and How Exclusion Occurs 

As in national data collection programs, most instances of exclusion of students with 
disabilities at the State level occur at three stages: when the assessment instruments 
% are developed; when the data are collected; and when results are analyzed, interpreted, 
and reported. State assessments commonly use commercial tests, which typically do 
not include students with disabilities in the development of the test. If they do, they 
do not report this information. This exclusion is problematic. Including representative 
samples of students with disabilities is not necessarily required in order to calculate 
accurate norms in well-standardized instruments. Nevertheless, including such 
individuals in test development is critical in order to learn what items or test 
administration procedures may need to be dropped or modified to accommodate the 
unique testing needs of students with disabilities (Daniels, 1989). 

Exclusion of students during assessment occurs for many of the same reasons as in 
national assessments, probably because the decision is typically made by local school 
staff. As at the national level, reasons range from a concern over being unable to 
provide proper accommodations to a concern that the assessment situation may be 
uncomfortable for the student. 

Exclusion during the analysis, interpretation, and reporting of State results occurs when 
students who were included in the assessments are excluded from the data analysis. 
This type of exclusion is more common in State-level assessments than in national 
assessments, possibly because of a desire to maintain higher school, district, or State 
results. Students with disabilities present many challenges to State agencies that try to 
include them in State assessments, and one solution is to remove their data from those 
of the non-disabled students.

ERJC 219 



Testing Accommodations for Students with Disabilities 



States with formal, written testing accommodation guidelines are shown in figure 5.4. 
The number increased from 28 States in 1991 to 35 in 1992. Testirg accommodations 
fall into four primary types: 

• presentation format; 

• response mode; 

• setting; and 

• scheduling or timing. 

Figure 5.5 presents the number of States using each type of accommodation in 1991 and 
1992. It is obvious from this comparison that States have increased their use of each 
type of accommodation. 



SUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS 

A national shift has occurred from a focus on process (what we do) to results (what we 
produce). This trend is very evident in education today. Parents, government agencies, 
businesses, and the community want to know more than, just the number of students 
in school, the number of teachers and their degrees, the quality of facilities, and the 
types of books in the school libraries. They want to know how students are affected 
by school. They want to know whether students are leaving school prepared for work, 
college, or other post-school experiences. They want to know, in short, if their 
investment in education has been worth it. 

This information is needed for all students, including students with disabilities. Access 
to special education services remains a critical issue, and educational results are just as 
important for students who receive special education services as for those who do not. 
The results are not the sole responsibility of special education, because students with 
special needs increasingly are part of the general education community. To obtain this 
information, students with disabilities must be included in the overall system of 
educational accountability measurement. 

Although States and the nation are making progress in measuring educational results 
for students with disabilities, significant problems remain: 

• Students with disabilities are disproportionately excluded from 

both State and national assessments. Even where guidelines 
about inclusion and exclusion exist, they are inconsistently 
implemented.

Accommodations for the special testing needs of students with 
disabilities are inconsistently applied. Thus, the 
accommodations or lack of accommodations can further 
complicate the task of assessing and analyzing results for these 
students. 

There are variations in how students with disabilities are 
defined and how their educational results are reported. These 
variations exist from State to State, between State programs 
and national data collection programs, among the various types 
of national programs, and even within national programs 
sponsored by individual agencies. 

Variations in definition and reporting methods make it difficult 
to disaggregate accurate information about educational results 
for students with disabilities. 



a 168 16m Annual Report To Congress: Chapter S 

ERIC 223 



• In order for educational results for students with disabilities to 
be more accurately assessed, States and Federal agencies may 
need to modify their approaches toward assessment. 

As the nation and the States continue producing data on the educational results of 
students who receive special education services, the National Center on Education 
Outcomes (NCEO) is considering several recommendations about how to include 
students with disabilities in assessments and how to make accommodations for them 
as they participate. For example: 

• Develop broader and more uniform definitions of who is 
included in assessment samples, and base the definitions on 
more inclusive sampling frames. 

• Increase the adherence to inclusion guidelines, and conduct 
follow-up studies to monitor adherence. 

• Document the characteristics of students who are not included 
in data collection programs. 

• Include students with disabilities when developing assessment 
instruments. 

• Develop and study assessment modifications, accommodations, 
and alternatives. 

There is no consensus on the extent to which students with disabilities should be 
included in large-scale assessments, nor on the issue of providing accommodations or 
determining what kinds of accommodations are acceptable (see, for example, several 
papers that express varying viewpoints on these issues ~ Ysseldyke & Thurlow, 1993c). 

To encourage schools and States to report results for all students receiving special 
education services NCEO has identified four major steps for creating a results-based 
reporting system at the State, school district, or school level: 

• Establish a solid foundation for the efforts. Involve 
stakeholders at the beginning of the process , get them to agree 
on why results will be measured, and develop a common set 
of definitions and assumptions. Fundamental issues are 
resolved at this point. 

• Develop, adopt, or adapt a model. Several models of 
education exist. Adopt or adapt one of these, or develop a 
new model. With stakeholders, select an overall approach. 
Then, with the input of stakeholders, define the domains, 
expected results, and indicators. 



224 

n 16m Annual Report To Congress: Chapter S 169 

ERIC 



• Establish a data collection and reporting system. 
Accountability is part of the reason for measuring results. To 
achieve accountability, first decide where data will come from, 
and then develop or adapt ways to collect and analyze data. 
It will be important at this time also to decide how data will be 
reported and how the information will be used. 

• Install the system. A results-based accountability system must 
be "installed." Make sure that there are incentives and support 
for the adoption and use of the system, that staff and the 
public are prepared for the changes that accompany the 
system, and that the system is evaluated as it is implemented. 

These steps are described in more detail in the NCEO Self-Study Guide to the 
Development of Educational Outcomes and Indicators (Ysseldyke & Thurlow, 1993b).

Assisting States And Localities In Educating All Children With Disabilities 



The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requires States receiving funds 
under the Act to make a free appropriate public education (FAPE) available to ail 
eligible children with disabilities. As part of its responsibilities under IDEA, the 
Department must "assess the impact and effectiveness of State and local efforts ... to 
provide ... free appropriate public education" to children and youth with disabilities 
[20 U.S.C. §1418(a)(l)-(2)]. 

The U.S. Department of Education, primarily through its Office of Special Education 
Programs (OSEP), aids State educational agencies and local school districts in 
.implementing the nation's special education mandates by providing financial assistance, 
monitoring oversight, and providing policy support and technical assistance. This 
chapter describes the activities that OSEP undertook during FY 1993 to accomplish 
these responsibilities, as well as the refinements that OSEP has made to its monitoring 
system to address revisions to the legal requirements of Part B and to otherwise 
improve the monitoring process. These changes help ensure compliance with Part B 
requirements in a manner that results in more effective educatiom\l experiences and 
results for students with disabilities as the Part B statute and regulations have changed 
to address such issues as transition to post-school activities and assistive technology. 
Even more significant, however, is the constant evolution in how States meet their 
responsibilities as they work to meet the requirements of State and Federal law, to 
respond to new and refined technologies and information about how students learn, 
to implement corrective actions imposed by monitoring and litigation, and to respond 
to fiscal and political exigencies. Because of this evolution and because, as discussed 
below, some deficient practices have persisted - notwithstanding OSEP monitoring, 
litigation, and the other pressures for change listed above - OSEP has continued, and 
will continue, to refine its monitoring procedures to meet' the mandates of Part B in a 
manner that most fully benefits its primary constituency - children with disabilities and 
their families. 



THE FEDERAL PROGRAM REVIEW PROCESS 

Each State must meet a number of statutory and regulatory requirements in order to 
receive Federal financial assistance under the Part B program. Among the most critical 
are the mandates in 20 U.S.C. §§1412(1) and (6) that the State demonstrate to the 
Secretary that: 

• The State has in effect a policy that assures all children with 

disabilities the right to a free appropriate public education; and 



9 

ERIC 



228 

16m Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 6 173 



• The State Educational Agency (SEA) shall be responsible for 
ensuring that the requirements of Part B are carried out and 
that all educational programs for children with disabilities 
within the State, including each program administered by any 
other public agency, are under {he general supervision of the 
persons responsible for educational programs for children with 
disabilities in the SEA and meet the educational standards of 
the SEA. 

Every three years, the State must submit to the Secretary of Education a State Plan that 
meets all of the Part B requirements specified in the implementing regulations at 34 
CFR §§300.121-300.154. The plan must include a copy of all State statutes, regulations, 
policies, standards, and procedures that the State has established to carry out the 
applicable Federal requirements and to provide assurances that it will adhere to these 
requirements. 

The SEA must review and approve applications for Part B funds submitted by eligible 
local educational agencies (LEAs) and other public agencies that provide special 
education and related services. Each LEA application for Part B funds must include all 
of the policies, procedures, and information required by the Part B regulations at 34 
CFR §§300.220-300.240, as well as certain additional procedures and assurances required 
by the Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) and the 
General Education Provisions Act (GEPA). The SEA must also monitor and evaluate 
the special education programs assisted by Part B funds, as required by §432(d)(b)(3) 
of GEPA and EDGAR at 34 CFR §80.40. 

To ensure that SEAs are accomplishing their responsibilities consistent with the Part B 
and EDGAR requirements, OSEP has initiated a multifaceted program review process 
that consists of the following activities: 

• reviewing State policy and technical assistance documents, SEA 
monitoring reports regarding LEAs and other public agencies, 
and other information utilized by an SEA to administer Part B; 

• reviewing and approving State Plans; 

• conducting on-site monitoring reviews; 

• verifying the implementation of Corrective Action Plans 
(CAPs); 

• reviewing final decisions of SEA complaint resolutions; 

• establishing ongoing communication with SEAs, national and 
State organizations, parents and advocates, and other 
constituents; and 

• conducting specific issue reviews.

ERIC 



22<J 



Under this multifaceted review process, OSEP reviews a State's Part B plan to 
determine whether the State has established procedures that are fully consistent with 
Part B, EDGAR, and GEPA requirements. OSEP also conducts on-site monitoring visits 
to the State to determine whether the State has implemented the SEA's procedures in 
a manner fully consistent with Part B, EDGAR, and GEPA. The CAP process is used 
to ensure that deficiencies found during monitoring are corrected. 

As noted above, OSEP's program review process is constantly undergoing refinement. 
Each year, OSEP refines its monitoring review to better integrate the various 
components of the process and to focus on those compliance areas that most directly 
and significantly affect students and their families. Past annual reports have identified 
many of the changes in each of the seven system components identified above. This 
report will focus primarily on OSEP's State plan review and on-site monitoring 
activities. 



STATE PLAN REVIEW AND APPROVAL 

To receive funds under Part B, a State must submit a State Plan once every three years 
to OSEP. The plan must describe in detail the policies and procedures the State has 
established and implemented to comply with the provisions of IDEA. It must include 
copies of the State statutes, regulations, and procedures that the State will use during 
the three-year grant period to implement the Part B requirements as specified in 34 CFR 
§§300.121-300.154. In addition, with respect to all of the State's public agencies that are 
responsible for providing special education to children with disabilities, the plan must 
provide sufficient detail to show how they are under the general supervision of the SEA 
and how each one ensures compliance with appropriate Federal and State law. 

As specified at 34 CFR §300.134, the plan must include a copy of each State statute, 
State regulation, signed agreement between respective agency officials, and any other 
documents that show compliance with the requirement under 34 CFR §300.600 that the 
SEA ensures that "... each educational program for children with disabilities 
administered within the State, including each program administered by any other 
public agency, ... is under the general supervision of the persons responsible for 
educational programs for children with disabilities in the SEA; and ... meets the 
education standards of the SEA (including the requirements of [Part B]). M (34 CFR 
§30C.600(a).) 

State Plans must be approved by the Secretary of Education before funds can be 
allocated. Because Part B is a "forward-funded" program, funds do not become available 
until July of the year in which they are appropriated. OSEP requires States to submit 
their plans for review by March 1, four months before the July date on which they are 
eligible to receive their funding. Funding is contingent upon approval of the plan.

Technical Assistance to States Regarding State Plans 



OSEP provided substantial technical assistance to States submitting State Plans in 1993 
for FY 1994-96 and to States that will be submitting State Plans for FY 1995-97 in 1994. 
The primary goals of this technical assistance have been, first, to help States understand 
what must be included in each State Plan, and, second, to help States format their State 
Plan submissions in a manner that will expedite OSEP review. 

As the centerpiece of this technical assistance, OSEP conducted State Plan Academies 
in the fall of 1992 and 1993 to provide training to key staff members from SEAs that 
would be submitting plans the following spring. During these well-attended one-day 
training sessions, OSEP reviewed plan content requirements, submission procedures, 
and time lines. As an additional benefit, the State Plan Academies have provided an 
excellent forum for OSEP to discuss with States the essence and nuances of core Part B 
provisions and for States to share with OSEP their challenges in meeting Part B 
requirements in the context of the difficult issues affecting education at both the State 
and Federal levels. This dialogue has enabled OSEP to work with States proactively 
to achieve compliance and educational effectiveness, thus accomplishing needed change 
in a timely and cooperative manner. 

In tandem with the State Plan Academies each year, OSEP disseminated to States a 
detailed memorandum outlining plan content and submission requirements. Attached 
to each memorandum was a comprehensive checklist delineating all of the required 
policies, procedures, information, and assurances. OSEP highlighted new content 
requirements in the memorandum, the checklist, and the State Plan Academies. This 
emphasis on new requirements was especially important in light of the many Part B 
amendments in P.L. 101^176 (1990) and P.L. 102-119 (1991). 

OSEP has also used less formal strategies to provide technical assistance to States 
regarding the development and submission of their State Plans. One key strategy is 
that OSEP has designated a State contact for each SEA. Each SEA is encouraged to 
work on an ongoing basis with its State contact and the corresponding section chief in 
developing its State Plan. The State contact system is complemented by designated 
substantive experts within the Program Review Branch 1 and senior policy analysts in 
the Office of the Director of the Division of Assistance to States. State contacts often 
refer complex issues to the appropriate OSEP specialist. 2 



The Program Review Branch includes designated experts in areas such as least restrictive environment, individualized education programs, local 
educational agency applications, procedural safeguards, transition, child count, and use of funds. 

Each State and Outlying Area is assigned to one of the five sections that constitute OSEP's Program Review Branch, and specifically to one section 
member who acts as the State contact for the SEA.

Deficiencies Identified by OSEP During Its Review of 21 3 FY 1 ^94-96 State Plans 



The types of policy and /or procedural issues that OSEP identified in new FY 1994-96 
State Plans are summarized in the following sections. 

Right to, and time lines for, free appropriate public education (34 CFR §§300.121 and 300.122). 
Thirteen of the 21 plans met all of the requirements of §§300.121 and 300.122. The 
remaining eight plans had one or more deficiencies. For example, three plans did not 
clearly and consistently require that a free appropriate public education (FAPE) be 
made available to all eligible children with a disability no later than their third 
birthday, 4 and three plans did not provide" ior all children who meet the IDEA 
definitions of "children with disabilities" to receive FAPE.. 

Full educational opportunity goal (34 CFR §§300.123, 300.125, and 300.126). Eleven of the 
21 plans met all of the requirements of §§300.123, 300.125 and 300.126. The remaining 
ten plans had one or more of the following deficiencies: 

• Three plans did not set forth a full educational opportunity 
goal for children from birth through age 21, as required by 
§300.123; 

• Six plans did not set forth a timetable for accomplishing the 
goal of providing a full educational opportunity for all children 
with disabilities, as required by §300.125; and 

• Five plans did not include a description of the kind and 
number of facilities, personnel, and services necessary 
throughout the State to meet the goal of providing a full 
educational opportunity for all children with disabilities, as 
required by §300.126. 

Child identification (34 CFR §300.128). Nine of the 21 plans were fully consistent with 
the requirements of §300.128. The remaining 12 plans omitted some of the specific 
requirements of that regulation. 

Individualized education programs (lEPs) (34 CFR §§300.340-300.350). Eight of the 21 plans 
were fully consistent with the requirements of §§300.340-300.350. The remaining 13 
plans had two or more deficiencies regarding IEPs. The majority of these deficiencies 
concerned transition-related requirements. 



1 One additional plan for FY 1994-96 was not submitted until after the completion of the analysis set forth in this chapter. 

4 Under 34 CFR §300.300. a State is eligible to receive Part B funds if the 9ntrt!ement to a free appropriate public education begins no later than a 
child's sixth birthday. However, as provided in Section 619 of the IDEA, a State may not receive any Part B. Chapter 1 (SOP), or IDEA discretionary 
funds for children age 3 through 5 unless the State makes a free appropriate public education available to all eligible children with a disability 
beginning no later than their third birthday. 



a 16m Annua^K^Srt To Congress: Chapter 6 177 

ERIC 



Procedural safeguards (34 CFR §§300.500-300.515). Five of the 21 plans were fully 
consistent with the requirements of §§300.500-300.515, and an additional four had one 
deficiency (§300.504(a), 300.512(d), 300.514(a) /(b), or 300.515). The remaining 12 plans 
had two or more deficiencies regarding procedural safeguard requirements. The 
majority of these deficiencies were technical in nature. 

Confidentiality of personally identifiable information (34 CFR §§300.560-300.575). Six of the 
21 State Plans were fully consistent with the requirements of §§300.560-300.575, and one 
omitted the requirement at 34 CFR §300.571 (b) that an agency or institution subject to 
regulations promulgated under the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) 
may not release information to participating agencies without parental consent unless 
authorized to do so by FERPA. The remaining 14 plans had two or more deficiencies 
regarding confidentiality of personally identifiable information. 

Least restrictive environment (34 CFR §§300.550-300.556). Nine of the 21 State plans were 
fully consistent with the requirements of §§300.550-300.556, and four of the plans 
omitted only the requirements of §300.554, that the SEA make arrangements with public 
and private institutions to ensure that the least restrictive environment requirements 
are effectively implemented. As summarized in table 6.1, the remaining eight plans had 
two or more deficiencies regarding placement in the least restrictive environment. 

Protection in evaluation procedures (34 CFR §§300.530-300.534). Thirteen of the 21 plans 
were fully consistent with the requirements of §§300.530-300.534. The other eight plans 
inlcuded one or more technical deficiencies. 

Responsibility of the state educational agency (34 CFR §§300.134 and 300.6001 Fifteen of the 
21 plans met the requirements of §§300.134 and 300.600 regarding the general 
supervision responsibility of the SEA. 5 The remaining six plans had the following 
deficiencies: 

• Two plans permitted public agencies to apply to the SEA for 
waivers from State standards but did not clarify that the SEA 
may not waive any Part B requirements. 

• Two plans omitted needed content from interagency 
agreements that the SEAs used to exercise their general 
supervision responsibility. 



5 To meet these requirements, a plan must show that: 

Each educational program for children with disabilities administered within the State, Including each program administered by any other public 
agency - (i) Is under the general supervision of the persons responsible for e-jucational programs for children with disabilities In the SEA; and (ii) 
Meets the education standards of the SEA (including the requirements of [Part B]) [§300.600(a)(2)]. 

Under §300.600, a State may establish procedures that permit the waiver of State standards, so long as those standards are not also Part B 
requirements.

• One plan omitted the requirement of §300.600(a)(2)(ii) that the 
SEA ensure that all educational programs for children with 
disabilities in the State, including each program administered 
by any other public agency, meet the education standards of 
the SEA (including the requirements of Part B). 

• One plan implied that the SEA was not required, as part of its 
general supervision responsibility, to ensure that due process 
hearing decisions were implemented. 

Comprehensive System of Personnel Development (34 CFR §§300.380-300.383). Four of the 
21 plans met all of the requirements of §§300.380-300.383 regarding the State's 
Comprehensive System of Personnel Development (CSPD). The deficiencies that OSEP 
found in the other 17 plans are summarized in table 6.2. 

Private schools (34 CFR §§300.400-300.403, 300.450-300.452, and 76.651-76.662). 6 Eight of 
the plans met all of the requirements of 34 CFR §§300.400-300.403, 300.450-300.452, and 
76.651-76.662 regarding private schools. An additional seven plans lacked only one of 
those requirements. The other 13 plans included one or more technical deficiencies. 

Recovery of funds (34 CFR §300.141). Under §300.141, a State Plan must include policies 
and procedures that ensure that the State seelcs to recover any fu^ds provided under 
Part B for services to a child who is determined to be erroneously included in the 
Part B child count. To meet this requirement, the plan mast include child count 
verification procedures that ensure: 

(1) the conducting of an accurate and unduplicated count of 
children with disabilities receiving special education and 
related services on December 1 of the count year; 

(2) the inclusion of children in the Part B count only if they are enrolled 
on December 1 in a school or program that is operated or supported 
by a public agency that provides them with special education and 
related services; and 

(3) the exclusion of children from the Part B count if, on December 1, 
they: 

• are not enrolled in a school or program operated or 
supported by a public agency; 

• are not provided special education that meets State 
standards; 



• §300.451(b) requires that the requirements in 34 CFR §§76.651-76.662 of EDGAR be met.

Ten of the 21 plans included an adequate description of procedures to ensure the 
recovery of funds for misclassified children, including procedures for verifying the 
accuracy of the child count. Two additional plans included an adequate description of 
the procedures that the State uses to verify the accuracy of the child count. One plan, 
however, permitted agencies to count certain children suspected of having a disability, 
and the other plan required recovery of funds only if less than 95 percent of the 
children counted by a public agency had a current IEP on the December 1 count date. 
The other nine plans included no description or an inadequate description of the 
procedures used by the SEA to ensure that the count is accurate and unduplicated. 

Notice and opportunity for hearing on LEA application [34 CFR §300.144 and 76.401(d)]? 
Fourteen of the 21 plans reviewed included all of the specific requirements of 
§76.401 (d), while the other seven plans did not. 

Annual evaluation (34 CFR §300.146). Nineteen of the 21 plans included procedures for 
evaluating, at least annually, the effectiveness of programs in meeting the educational 
needs of children with disabilities, including evaluation of IEPs, as required by 
§300.146. Two did not. 

Use of Part B funds (34 CFR §§300.148 and 300.149). Twelve of the plans included all of 
the requirements of §300.149. The remaining nine plans included one or more technical 
deficiencies. 

Personnel Standards (34 (CFR §300.153). Sixteen of the 21 plans did not: (1) include 
sufficient information to ensure that the State's standards for each profession or 
discipline that provides special education and related services, including standards for 
temporary or emergency certification, were based on the highest requirements in the 
State applicable to that profession or discipline; or (2) include the steps the State was 
taking to ensure that, by a specified date, all persons providing special education and 
related services meet entry-level degree requirements based on the highest requirements 
in the State. 



7 Pursuant to §300.144, each State Plan must include procedures to ensure that the SEA does not take any final action with respect to an application 
submitted by an LEA before giving the LEA reasonable notice and an opportunity for a hearing under §76.401 (d) of EDGAR.

ON-SITE MONITORING REVIEW 



The on-site monitoring review process is another important component of the Federal 
program review. OSEP conducts an on-site monitoring review of each State and 
Outlying Area receiving financial assistance under Part B approximately once every 
four years. OSEP uses the data collected from the on-site monitoring reviews to assess, 
first, the extent to which the policies, procedures, and assurances in the State's 
approved Part B Plan are actually being implemented, and, second, the effectiveness of 
the State's systems for general supervision. 

Many of the methods used and issues investigated are consistent across on-site 
monitoring reviews. Each State, however, has unique systems, strengths, and 
weaknesses. OSEP will, therefore, tailor the procedures it uses to collect, verify, and 
analyze data when necessary to ensure that the monitoring and corrective action 
processes are accurate and effective. Before each actual on-site visit, OSEP gathers and 
analyzes information from a range of sources to assist in planning and implementing 
the compliance review process. This process currently includes areas such as the 
following: 

(1) Reviewing and analyzing a number of documents, including 
but not limited to the State Plan (including the State's laws and 
regulations), policy letters and advisories, handbooks and 
guidelines, prior monitoring reports and conective action 
documents, consumer complaints, and results of hearings and 
recent litigation; and 

(2) Soliciting information from interested parents, advocates, and 
representatives of professional groups by holding pre-site visit 
public meetings in the State, and by requesting pre-site visit 
written comments. To maximize the helpfulness of such public 
input, OSEP's notices regarding these meetings regularly 
request that public comment focus on the following compliance 
areas: 



the education of students with disabilities in the 
least restrictive environment appropriate to their 
educational needs; 

the development and implementation of 
individualized education programs, including 
parent involvement; 

due process and other procedural safeguards, 
including notice, consent, independent 
educational evaluation, confidentiality, and 
hearings; 



184 16m Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 6

• protection in evaluation procedures; 

• free appropriate public education, including 
extended school year and transition services; 

• complaint management, including procedures 
for accepting and resolving complaints 
regarding the implementation of Part B; 

• the State's application and review procedures 
for school districts and other agencies applying 
for Part B funds; and 

• the process by which the SEA monitors the 
compliance of school districts and other 
agencies. 

(3) Interviewing SEA officials regarding the State's systems for 
general supervision and the unique characteristics of the State's 
special and general education service models. 

From this information, OSEP specifically tailors its on-site monitoring to the State under 
review. Within that State-specific tailoring, each review is designed to ensure that, at 
a minimum, the following areas of SEA responsibility are examined: provision of 
services to ensure a free appropriate public education; SEA monitoring; SEA review and 
approval of LEA applications (except in States and Outlying Areas that do not have 
separate LEAs and do not, therefore, have an LEA application process); complaint 
management; submission and verification of child count; protection in evaluation 
procedures; due process and procedural safeguards; placement in the least restrictive 
environment; and individualized educational programs. 

As illustrated in table 6.3, there typically are eight steps in OSEP's on-site monitoring 
process. It is important to note, however, that on-site monitoring is only one element 
of the multifaceted and continuous process that OSEP uses to collect information and 
gain an understanding of each State's systems for compliance. 



Schedule for On-Site Monitoring Reviews 

Table 6.4 lists the 15 States and Outlying Areas in which OSEP conducted on-site 
monitoring reviews during the 1992-93 school year, as well as the 15 scheduled during 
the 1993-94 school year. 

OSEP issued 11 draft monitoring reports and eight final reports during FY 1993. The 
findings that OSEP included in the final monitoring reports are summarized in 
table 6.5.

Table 6.3 Typical Steps in Conducting On-Site Monitoring 
Reviews . . . 


Step 


Specific Activities 


Step 1: 

Select and inform 
States that will be 
monitored during 
following school year 


• Based primarily upon the date on which States were last monitored, 
select States that will be monitored during the following school year. 
(Under the current schedule, OSEP visits approximately 15 States each 
school year.) 

• In the spring, inform States that will be monitored the following 
school year. 


Step 2: 

Conduct monitoring 
academy and arrange 
visit dates 


• In the spring, conduct monitoring academy for States that OSEP will 
monitor the following year. 

• At the time of the academy or shortly thereafter, arrange dates with 
State for public meeting/ pre-site visit and on-site visit. 


Step 3: 

Conduct public 
meeting/ pre-site visit 


• Send written notice to SEA and to State and national advocacy 
organizations of purpose, schedule, and location of public meetings. 

• Conduct public meetings to gather input from interested organizations 
and individuals regarding appropriate issues and geographical focuses 
of OSEP compliance review. 

• While in State for public meetings, meet with SEA officials to plan on- 
site visit, to collect data regarding State systems for general 
supervision, and to collect other information to assist in identifying 
appropriate issues and geographical focuses for OSEP compliance 
review. 


Step 4: 

Develop monitoring 
plan 


• After return from pre-site visit, continue to receive (and, if 
appropriate, solicit) written and telephone comments to assist in 
identifying appropriate issues and geographical focuses for OSEP 
compliance review. 

• Analyze and synthesize information from the public meetings and 
other comment sources; pre-site meetings with SEA; SEA documents 
(including State plan, monitoring and LEA application review 
documents, placement data, funding formulas, etc.); previous OSEP 
monitoring report(s) and related CAP documents; and other relevant 
information. 

• Use information from the public meetings, State Plan, and document 
review to determine appropriate focuses for compliance review, to 
design data collection and verification strategies and forms, and to 
select State agencies and LEAs to be visited to collect data regarding 
the effectiveness of SEA's systems for general supervision.

Step 



Specific Activities 



Step 5: 

Conduct on-site 
review 



Interview SEA officials and review SEA documents to complete 
collection of data regarding SEA's systems for general supervision. 

Interview officials from other State agencies that provide educational 
and/or residential services to students with disabilities, to determine 
whether the educational programs for such students are under the 
general supervision of the SEA and meet the requirements of Part B 
and the standards of the SEA. 

Collect data in a number of public agencies, including local 
educational agencies, to determine effectiveness of SEA's systems for 
general supervision. (Data collects i methods include reviewing 
student records and interviewing agency administrators, teachers, and 
parents.) 

Note exemplary programs and practices. 

Discuss preliminary findings with SEA officials in exit conference. 



Step 6: 

Analyze data and 
prepare draft report 



• Analyze and synthesize data collected from all sources to determine 
areas of noncompliance. 

• Prepare draft report that identifies legal requirements, findings of 
noncompliance, data that support each finding, and required corrective 
actions designed to ensure effective and comprehensive correction. 

• Issue a draft report to the SEA for review and comment. 



Step 7: 

Prepare and issue 
final report 



Receive and review the SEA response and any additional information 
submitted by the SEA. 

Based upon information in SEA response, make any necessary 
modification to the draft report to ensure its accuracy and 
completeness; issue as a final report to the SEA. 

Release the final report to members of public on request. 



Step 8: 

Review State 
documentation of 
corrective action 



Review and respond to State's proposed Corrective Action Plan (CAP) 
for meeting Federal requirements. 

Approve State's corrective action products and procedures. 
Document completion of State's CAP.

Study Of Special Populations Native American Students V'th Disabilities 



According to the 1990 U.S. Census, 1.9 million Americans, or approximately 0.8 percent 
of the general population, claimed Native American status. More than 5 million 
additional individuals indicated that they were of Native American descent, but did not 
claim "American Indian" as their ethnic identity (Bureau of the Census, 1990; 
Hodgkinson, 1992). Approximately 637,000 Native Americans are reported as living on 
Federally recognized reservations or trust lands, with more than 252,000 additional 
Native American individuals living in cities. The remaining number live in rural or 
suburban areas outside Federal reservations (Bureau of the Census, 1990). 1 

Native Americans may comprise a small proportion of the U.S. population, but they 
represent a significant presence in several States and metropolitan areas. Half of the 
Native American population is concentrated in six States (Oklahoma, California, 
Arizona, New Mexico, Alaska and Washington). The reservation with the largest 
population (143,000) is the Navajo reservation, which occupies parts of Arizona, 
New Mexico and Utah. The metropolitan areas with the largest concentrations of 
Native Americans are New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago and San Francisco (Bureau 
of the Census, 1990). 

Between 1980 and 1990, the Native American population increased 54 percent. This is 
attributable to a birth rate 28 percent higher than the non-Native American population, 
decreasing infant mortality, and a rise in individuals reclaiming their Native American 
status due to increased cultural interest and decreased racial /ethnic barriers (O'Brien, 
1992; Szasz, 1992). In the 1980 Census, the largest number of Native Americans were 
between 10 and 19 years of age. In the 1990 Census, the largest Native American age 
group was birth through age 9 (National Advisory Council on Indian Education 
[NACIE], 1992). The current median age of Native Americans is 23.5 years, compared 
to the non-Native median age of 30.0 years. 



DEFINITION OF "NATIVE AMERICAN" 

Within the Native American community, differences in the way the term "Native 
American" is defined are based primarily on the proportion of lineage traceable directly 



1 This chapter uses the term 'Native American' to refer to this population. Other reports, studies, or organizations may use the term 'American 
Indian,' and that may appear In this report when these sources are referenced.

to Native American ancestors. Definitions based on the different criteria used for the 
data collections presented in this chapter are described below: 2 



U.S. Census Definition: In the 1990 Census, individuals were 
counted as Native Americans if they (1) stated it as their ethnic 
identity, and (2) provided the name of a State recognized or 
Federally recognized tribe or native village to which they 
belonged. In the Census, the term "Native American" refers to 
American Indians, Alaskan Natives, and Aleuts. Note that the 
procedure used in the 1990 Census was a change from the 1980 
(and previous) Census, when the census-taker rather than the 
respondent determined an individual's ethnic identity. 

National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP): NAEP data 
on race /ethnicity w : A self-reported, with few guidelines 
provided to students ?• o what the term means. The specific 
language of the question asked whether the student is an 
American Indian or Alaskan Native. Race /ethnicity data on 
students who were excluded from the NAEP assessment based 
on disability or limited English proficiency were provided by 
school personnel; the criteria they used are not known. 

The U.S. Government officially recognizes more than 500 Native 
American tribes and Alaska Native villages; however, there are 
many other tribes officially recognized by one or more States, 
and a number of tribes are in the process of seeking Federal 
recognition. Criteria for tribal membership vary from one tribe 
to another. Most tribes require a 25 percent blood quantum 
level, some accept proof of descendancy, while others (16 
tribes) require a 50 percent blood quantum level (personal 
communication, BIA, August 1993). 



CHARACTERISTICS OF NATIVE AMERICANS THAT MAY AFFECT EDUCATIONAL 
PERFORMANCE 

The National Advisory Council on Indian Education (NACIE) (1992) reports that 
347,291 public school students are Native American. This represents between 85 and 
90 percent of all Native American children in school; the remainder attend reservation 
schools administered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). To be eligible to attend a 
BIA school, a child must be a member of a Federally recognized tribe, live on a 



The methods used to identify students' race/ethnicity for other data sets mentioned in this appendix vary, and are not well defined. For example, 
data obtained from school records to determine race/ethnicity may be based upon school personnel's observations of students, on last names 
indicating ethnic identity, on parent-provided information, or on student self-reports. The literature cited in this appendix does not usually report 
the definition used for Native American, but usually does report the source of the population Identification, which may suggest the basis for the 
definition. For example, if the students attend a BIA school, the definition is known. If the students live on a reservation but attend a public school, 
the definition Is less certain. These students may self-Identify as Native Americans, but they may or may not be enrolled members of a tribe, and 
the tribe may or may not be Federally racognized or State recognized

reservation, and have a 25 percent Native American blood quantum level (O'Connell, 
1987). Approximately 50 percent of Native American children who live on reservations 
attend public school, with the remainder attending BIA-operated schools or schools 
operated by other groups under contract to the BIA (NACIE, 1991). 

Although Native American students comprise only 0.98 percent of the public school 
enrollment nationwide, they account for at least 9 percent of school enrollment in 
Alaska, Oklahoma, and New Mexico (Indian Nations At Risk Task Force, 1991). In 
Arizona, Montana, and North Dakota, Native Americans account for more than 6 
percent of public school enrollment. Enrollment of Native Americans students is more 
than 1 percent in 16 other States (Bureau of the Census, 1990). 

Native Americans, as a group, are disadvantaged. Native Americans have high rates 
of poverty and unemployment, low educational attainment, and a 35.5 percent high 
school dropout rate (O'Brien, 1992), about 25 percent higher than the national average. 
Increased health-related problems and a shorter life span than other Americans are also 
characteristic of Native Americans. The death rate from alcohol-related causes is three 
times higher than among the general population (Hodgkinson, 1992). These types of 
problems are more severe for Native Americans who live on reservations or in rural 
areas. 

Only 9 percent of Native American adults have completed four years of college, 
compared to 20 percent of the total population (O'Brien, 1992). Wright (1992) cites an 
even wider disparity, with only 6 percent of Native Americans holding four-year 
college degrees, compared to 23 percent of the total population. 

In addition to economic disadvantage, several other factors may impede the ability of 
Native Americans to succeed in school; these are described in more depth below. 



Residence in Rural Areas 

Most Native Americans live in rural areas, both on and off reservations. The rural 
nature of much of the Native American population makes it difficult to provide 
sufficient support services. Documented problems in providing services to rural 
residents include poor access to services, limited resources, transportation problems, 
and under-utilization of existing services (O'Connell, 1987). The effects of a rural 
location on personnel recruiting, and retention, on service delivery, and on program 
cost are also significant. 

As shown in table 7.1, almost 50 percent of Native American students attend school in 
the nation's smallest school districts, which tend to be mainly rural. This is one factor 
that distinguishes the Native American population from all other small population 
groups in the United States. Approximately 57 percent of the nation's public school 
districts are small, rural districts that enroll about 20 percent of the student population 
nationwide (Office for Civil Rights, 1993). Given that a large number of students in the 
general population attend small, rural schools in sparsely populated districts, there is

increased interest in helping rural school districts provide greater educational 
opportunity (Freitas, 1992). In 1990, Freitas conducted a survey of superintendents and 
business managers of small, rural school districts. Based on this survey data, Freitas 
suggests that rural location and small size impact negatively on education because of: 

• isolation imposed by terrain and distance; 

• declining economies in many rural areas (including high rates 
of poverty and unemployment); 

• the financial burden of Federal and State-mandated but 
underfunded or unfunded programs; 

• reduced community value for formal education; and 

• inappropriate and /or poor fiscal management practices. 

While the districts Freitas (1992) uses as examples are not on Native American 
reservations or tribal lands, many of the descriptions would apply to these schools as 
well. One of the particular difficulties in these districts is the high cost of special 
education, which limits districts' ability to provide a diversity of programs for students. 

Small rural districts in many parts of the country have more limited resources for 
minority education than large urban districts that serve significant numbers of minority 
students. Teachers and school staff in rural areas, often trained in large universities, 
may be unfamiliar with the cultural and language differences that affect the placement 
and performance of local minority students. In addition, in school districts included 
in a survey of rural schools, none had any formal in-district training to ensure that 
Native Americans were appropriately assessed, even among those school districts 
indicating that training was needed (Vadasy, Maddo/ & Davidson, 1992). 



Language 

Speaking a language other than English as one's first language (language minority or 
LM) or limited proficiency in standard American English are characteristics that 
negatively impact the effectiveness of education for children from small racial /ethnic 
populations in the United States. Native Americans speak more than 250 native 
languages (Chafe, 1974). Many Native American children, particularly those living on 
or near reservations and trust lands, speak only their native language prior to attending 
school, or are limited English proficient (LEP) when they begin school. Educational 
difficulties and risk factors associated with LM-LEP status are well documented (U.S. 
Department of Education, 1993). In addition, cultural differences between Native 
Americans and school personnel may impact on educational achievement.

Culture 



It is important to recognize that Native American culture differs greatly from the 
majority American culture, and that some of these differences affect schooling. Native 
American children learn mainly by observation, rather >han by direct instruction 
(Johnson, 1991). Children from some traditional Native American communities may 
be taught that the family is the most critical unit, and that they are representatives of 
their family first, and individuals second. Thus, individual performance is less 
important than it might be in the majority culture (Johnson & Ramirez, 1987). 

The remainder of this chapter presents a compilation of information on the current 
status of the provision of special education and related services to Native American 
students with disabilities. The first section describes the numbers and characteristics 
of Native American students with disabilities, including preschoolers, and school-aged 
children served in public and BIA schools. The second section outlines educational 
programs for all Native American students and those that specifically target Native 
American students with disabilities. A description of funding of special education 
services for Native Americans is also included in this section. In the third major section 
the provision of special education services to Native American students with disabilities 
is described. Identification and assessment of special education students, educational 
placement, curricula development, instructional methods, and the search for adequate 
numbers of qualified personnel to meet educational needs are discussed. 



NUMBERS AND CHARACTERISTICS OF NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENTS 
WITH DISABILITIES 

Data from the Fall 1990 Elementary and Secondary School Civil Rights Survey (Office 
for Civil Rights, 1993) indicate that Native Americans comprise approximately 1 percent 
of total public school enrollees, and approximately 1 percent of the children with 
mental retardation, emotional disturbance, learning disabilities, and speech and 
language impairments nationwide. As shown in table 7.2, Native Americans are more 
likely to receive special education services for these disabilities than children from all 
other racial /ethnic groups, except for black students. For Native Americans, as with 
all other racial /ethnic groups, the disability with the highest incidence is specific 
learning disabilities, with speech impairments the second largest category (see table 7.3). 

The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) gathered data related to 
race/ethnicity and disability for the sample of students in the 1990 NAEP survey 
(NCES, 1993). For Native American students, the rate of enrollment in special 
education was not in proportion to the general school population. 3 In the sample, 
which was drawn to be representative of three age/grade cohorts in the nation, 



These students a!! attend public, non-BIA schools. BIA schools were Included In the sampling frame, but none were actually drawn in the sample 
used.

Native Americans accounted for 2.5 percent of students in the grade 4/age 9 cohort, but 
4.1 percent of the grade 4/age 9 students in special education. For the grade 8/ age 14 
cohort, Native Americans comprised 1.8 percent of the students anH 2.3 percent of the 
students in special education. Likewise for the grade 12, .7 cohort, Native 
Americans represented 0.8 percent of students enrolled and 1.8 percent of the special 
education students. These data indicate that Native Americans may comprise a 
somewhat disproportionate percentage of the special education population. 



Preschool-Aged Native American Students with Disabilities 

In 1990, the General Accounting Office (GAO) (1990) reported to Congress an estimate 
of the number of Native American preschoolers with disabilities and the sufficiency of 
services provided to them. The study was limited to preschoolers at 63 of 297 BIA- 
operated schools on Federally recognized Native American reservations in 20 States. 
The data were collected primarily from the coordinators of special education in BIA 
field offices. Researchers concluded that (1) many Native American preschoolers have 
not been identified and are not receiving any services; (2) of those who are identified 
and receive some services, few have completed Individualized Education Plans (IEPs); 
and (3) of those with IEPs, at least 24 percent do not receive all the services 
recommended on them. 

GAO estimated that 8,500 to 12,800 Native American children age 3 or 4 had some type 
of disability. Of these children, 2948 lived on reservations or tribal lands with BIA 
schools. Of these, 838 received special education services in the 1989-90 school year 
from the BIA, from Indian Head Start, from the Indian Health Service, or from public 
schools. GAO reported that the remainder received either inadequate or no services.

GAO suggested that changes in policy, procedures, and/or funding were needed to 
provide more and better services to these young children. 



Native American Students with Disabilities Served in BIA Schools 

Prior to the 1975 passage of P.L. 94-142, funds and services for Native American 
children and youth with disabilities were minimal and, to a large extent, unknown. 
There were 6,578 students with disabilities, age 6 through 21, served under Part B in 
BIA-operated schools in the 1992-93 school year. Of the Native American children 
served in special education programs in BIA schools, 9.4 percent are age 6 through 17, 
and 5.6 percent are in the transition age group of 18-21 (see table 7.4). BIA does not 
directly provide services for the birth through age five population. That population is 
served through States or State programs affiliated with BIA (U.S. Department of 
Education, 1992j. 



Types of Disability of Native American Students in BIA Schools 

The proportion of students age 6 through 21 with disabilities is approximately 10.7 
percent, which is similar to that in the nation as a whole (Office for Civil Rights, 1993). 
The most recent OSEP data show that the proportion of special education students with 
specific learning disabilities served in BIA schools (see table 7.5) is 4.5 percentage points 
higher for Native Americans than for the nation as a whole. Dodd and Rose (1991) 
explain that the greater prevalence of learning disabilities in the Native American 
population may be attributable to problems with tests and identification procedures. 
Since the causes of learning disabilities are not well known, however, they also suggest 
that "some of the suspected causes might be more frequent among Native American 
persons/' As an example, Dodd and Rose cite a higher incidence of otitis media 
(infection of the middle ear) among Native American children, as well as studies 
showing a relationship between otitis media and later reading problems. They also 
raise the possibility that the high rate of substance abuse reported among Native 
American people may contribute to high rates of learning disabilities in the population. 
Another alternative, explained by Vadasy and Maddox (1993), is that in districts with 
many students with extreme educational needs and a variety of compensatory and 
remedial programs, special education becomes "the service of last resort," where the 
hardest~to-serve students are placed. Thus, Native American children, who may often 
have complex needs in language, learning, health, and social areas, are often placed in 
special education. 

Native American Students with Disabilities Served in Public Schools 

Little information is available describing Native Americans with disabilities who attend 
public schools or the special education programs and services in which they participate. 
Since Native Americans are often grouped in the "other" category for race /ethnicity, 
their data often cannot be analyzed separately (Johnson, 1991).

Furthermore, some studies that identify Native Americans as a group do not use a 
sampling design that permits separate analyses of data on Native Americans, or 
comparisons with other racial /ethnic groups. 

The 1990 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) provides some 
information on special education for Native Americans who do not attend BIA-operated 
schools. 4 Students in special education could be included in the 1990 NAEP 
assessment procedures if school personnel thought that the students could participate 
meaningfully in the testing. Students could be excluded from the assessment for 
reasons of disability, limited English proficiency, or inadequate reading skiils. 



The NAEP sampling frame Included BIA schools; however, when sampling procedures were completed, none were actually selected for the sample. 




204 16m Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 7 

2G0 



Additional data, which included reasons for exclusion, were then collected for all non- 
tested students. 

As shown in table 7.6, in the grade 4/age 9 cohort, 3.7 percent of Native Americans had 
an IEP; this percentage was larger than all other racial/ethnic groups. In the grade 
8/age 13 cohort, 2.1 percent of Nativv* American children had an IEP; this proportion 
was only slightly higher than that for whites and lower than that for Hispanics and 
blacks. In the oldest cohort, 3.0 percent of Native Americans had an IEP; this figure 
was higher than that for all other racial /ethnic groups. 

The sampling design and the small number of Native Americans in the excluded 
student sample do not support drawing conclusions about the Native American 
population in general. Within the group of excluded students, however, the 
characteristics of Native American students fit the patterns observed in other data. For 
example, the largest category of disability for the two older age /grade cohorts is 
specific learning disabilities. In the youngest age /grade cohort, a high incidence of 
speech impairments is reported, as well as visual impairments. Of the Native American 
students excluded from the NAEP assessment, in all three age/grade cohorts, more 
than 75 percent were excluded because of their disability. In the grade 12/age 17 
cohort, another 8.3 percent were excluded for both disability and limited English 
proficiency. In the youngest cohort, nearly 20 percent of the excluded students were 
considered non-readers and were excluded for that reason (NCES, 1992). 



EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS FOR NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENTS WITH 
DISABILITIES 

This section describes some of the Federal programs designed to help State and local 
education agencies meet the educational needs of Native American children or to assist 
in areas where Native Americans tend to reside. The first part describes programs 
available for all children. The second part describes services specifically for infants, 
toddlers, preschoolers, children, and youth with disabilities. 



Federal General Education Programs Serving Native Americans 

Two Federal programs that assist in meeting the educational needs of all Native 
American students are the Johnson O'Malley Educational Assistance Program and the 
Impact Aid Program. 

The Johnson O'Malley Educational Assistance Program provided nearly $25 million, in 
FY 1991, to the BIA to fund supplementary programs for qualified Native American 
children (including those with disabilities) attending public schools, and to support 
programs for 3- and 4-year-old Native American children. The supplemental activities 
supported by this program relate to education needs, teacher support, and parent costs. 
A total of 225,871 children were served in this program in FY 1991 (NACIE, 1992).

The Impact Aid Program, in FY 1991, provided more than $260 million to school 
districts for 123,225 children who live on Native American land end attend school in 
the district or whose parents work on the land. Because these students and their 
families do not live within the district and are not included in its tax base, Congress 
authorizes grants to the districts to help pay for their services. A higher per-pupil 
amount is provided for children with disabilities than for those without disabilities. 
This program does not directly serve Native American children by setting aside the 
grants as strictly for use in conjunction with those services, but "indirectly as deemed 
appropriate by the school district" - that is, the monies are used in the district's genera? 
budget (NACIE, 1992). 



Federal Programs Serving Native Americans with Disabilities 

Almost nine of every ten school-age Native American children attend public schools 
and are provided special education services and programs through the same channels 
and funding as any public school student. State and local dollars account for 
approximately 93 percent of funding for all special education. This amount is 
supplemented by Federal special education funding under Part B, which allocates funds 
to States based on child count data. States then distribute Part B funds to school 
districts. Public school districts are responsible for providing services to eligible 
children, and for collecting and reporting required data to the State. Native American 
students with disabilities who attend public schools and do not reside on Native 
American reservations or tribal lands are served under this arrangement. 

For some Native Americans with disabilities, however, the pattern for special education 
funding and service delivery differs from public schools. As noted previously, the 
Department of Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) plays an important role in 
schools that are on the reservations or trust lands of Federally recognized tribes. In 
some cases, the BIA operates schools or contracts with other organizations (primarily 
Native American tribes) to operate schools. On other reservations and trust lands, 
tribes operate their own schools independently from the BIA. 



IDEA Part B Set-Aside 

Furling for special education through Part B for students with disabilities age 5 
through 21 in BIA schools is based not on child count, but on a set-aside from State 
formula funds. The IDEA Amendments of 1991 (P.L. 102-119) changed the formula 
used to du 'ibute the set-aside funds. Originally, the set-aside was 1.25 percent of the 
aggregate amount provided in Part B for students age 3 through 21 to all States for that 
fiscal year. The amended formula sets aside 1 percent of the aggregate amount for 
students age 5 through 21, and .25 percent for students age 3-5. 

The amendments also reduced the responsibilities of the Secretary of the Interior for the 
education of Native American children with disabilities, while increasing the 
responsibilities of State education agencies (SEAs) for Native American children with 



26j 

16th Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 7 207 

ERIC 



disabilities who live on reservations but are not enrolled in elementary or secondary 
programs operated or funded by the BIA. Prior to the amendments, the Secretary of 
the Interior was responsible for submitting a plan to the appropriate Congressional 
committees that made provision for services to all children with disabilities residing on 
reservations, whether or not the reservation was served by a BIA school and provided 
foi coordination of services, regardless of the source, including Federal agencies and 
States. Under the amended Act, the Secretary is now responsible for providing services 
to children with disabilities age 5 through 21 who are enrolled in elementary and 
secondary schools for Native American children operated or funded by the Secretary 
of the Interior. SEAs are now "responsible for ensuring that all of the requirements of 
Part B are implemented for all children aged 3-21 on reservations" who are not served 
by BIA schools (34 CFR §300.300(c)). 

This means that the BIA and SEAs share responsibility and must cooperate to ensure 
the provision of necessary services to Native American children with disabilities. While 
the role of SEAs in funding, data collection, and compliance was previously somewhat 
ambiguous, the regulatory changes have clarified roles, giving SEAs broader 
responsibility for ensuring compliance with IDEA and for data collection. 

The 1 percent set-aside under Part B provided over $25 million in special education 
programs and services to 6,578 children with disabilities (age 6 through 21) who lived 
on Native American reservations with BIA schools in FY 1991. 



IDEA Part H Program 

The Program for Infants and Toddlers was created by Part H of P.L. 99-457, the 
Education of the Handicapped Act Amendments of 1986. Part H requires the States to 
address the needs of infants and toddlers (children from birth through age 2) with 
disabilities and their families through a multiagency, multidisciplinary, family-centered, 
coordinated system of culturally sensitive services. Child Find activities, coordinated 
with a variety of health and social service agencies, are the main vehicle for identifying 
children. 

Programs for children with disabilities or those at risk, from birth through age 5, are 
widely recognized as crucial in preventing school failure in later years. The benefits 
of such programs for young Native American children with disabilities include 
developing increased language skills, providing opportunities for parents to become 
advocates for their children before they enter a school environment, and providing 
home-based opportunities for parent training and family intervention (Vadasy & 
Maddox, 1993). Early intervention measures may be effective in helping prevent the 
need for special education services later on. Despite the benefits of these programs, 
however, they have not been available for many Native American children and their 
families (GAO, 1990). Because of the rapid growth in the birth through age 9 segment 
of the Native American population, there is a need to expand early childhood programs 
for at-risk children and for children with disabilities in public and tribal education 
settings. 




208 16TH ANNUAL REPORT TO CONGRESS: CHAPTER 7

IDEA Part B Preschool Grant Program 



From age 3 through 5, children with disabilities are eligible to receive special education 
services under the Preschool Grant Program. In its 1990 study, GAO suggested that 
Native American preschoolers with disabilities are inadequately served. Researchers 
identified several reasons for insufficient service provision, including an acute shortage 
of qualified personnel in BIA schools and inadequate funding to hire a sufficient 
number or qualified personnel. At the time of the report, at least 61 specialized staff 
vacancies existed. As a result of increases in the target population, field offices 
requested $4.3 million in the 1988-89 school year. BIA provided only $2.7 million to 
promote specific educational services (GAO, 1990). 

GAO (1990) also noted the lack of clear agreement between the BIA and States about 
which was responsible for providing services to young Native American children with 
disabilities on reservations with BIA schools. "These differences could make efforts to 
serve these children difficult and contribute to BIA's inability to serve some children 
for whom it is responsible," GAO found. Furthermore, GAO explained, "Interior 
believes BIA is only responsible for children enrolled in its programs and that it may 
supplement other providers' services. Education and some States believe that BIA is 
solely responsible for all Indian children on reservations with BIA schools." Subsequent 
changes in law a .ad regulation were made to clarify responsibility for delivering services 
to young Native American children with disabilities. 

The IDEA Amendments of 1991 and implementing regulations included major changes 
aimed at programs for young Native American children with disabilities on 
reservations. These changes were meant to clarify the legal responsibilities of various 
agencies in serving Native American children with disabilities, and to change funding 
patterns to reflect changes in responsibility for service provision. The amendments 
directly affect service provision to children with disabilities who reside on or near 
Native American reservations served by BIA-funded schools. Problems with preschool 
programs noted by Congress in passing the 1991 amendments to IDEA included: 

• lack of clarity with respect to which entity, the BIA or the 
State, is responsible for each student or child; 

• lack of Child Find activity, leading researchers to project a 
population of up to 90,000 preschool-age students who have 
not been identified and who are not receiving services; and 

• inadequate services and individualized education programs 
(IEPs) or inappropriate IEPs based upon available, not "needed" 
services (U.S. Congress, 1991). 

Recent changes in regulations for the Part H program, which serves children aged birth 
through two years, represent an effort to provide for a "seamless system of services for 
children with disabilities from birth through 5 years of age." Congress recognized the 
need to provide a smooth transition between Part H and the Preschool Grant Program, 
and to maintain programs that are appropriate and family focused, without overlap in

funding or services. Regulatory changes for the Preschool Grant Program became final 
in September 1992. Some of these changes directly affect funding patterns, data 
collecting and reporting, and programmatic responsibility for Native American children 
with disabilities. The changes in responsibilities resulting from the 1991 Amendments 
are reflected in table 7.7, which summarizes the provisions. 

OSEP Personnel Preparation Grants 

In FY 1991, the Office of Special Education Programs' Division of Personnel Preparation 
funded 23 projects to train Native Americans to serve Native American children with 
disabilities and recruit Native Americans in areas of high Native American populations 
to teach in these areas. Funding for these programs in FY 1991 totalled more than $1.9 
million (NACIE, 1992). 



THE PROVISION C* SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES TO NATIVE AMERICAN 
STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES 

This section describes the provision of appropriate special education services for Native 
American students. Major steps in the educational process, including identification and 
assessment, placement, curriculum development, instructional methods, and personnel 
are described as they relate to Native American students with disabilities. Particular 
challenges resulting from limited English proficiency, culture, and residence in rural 
areas are discussed. 



Identification and Assessment 

Assessment processes specified in IDEA are meant to ensure that those who place 
children in special education programs have sufficient knowledge of their abilities and 
disabilities to design an appropriate program and measure progress within that 
program. Accurate, fair assessment of Native American children is intricately affected 
by the interaction among the child's ability, the parents, the assessment instruments, 
and the assessor, all of which must operate within a language and cultural context that 
is fair and appropriate. 

IDEA stipulates stringent evaluation procedures. Tests must not be racially or 
culturally discriminatory, and test materials and procedures must be provided and 
administered in the language or other mode of communication in which the student is 
most proficient, unless it is clearly not feasible to do so (34 CFR §300.532). 

Johnson (1991) suggests that assessment is one of the most important issues to address 
in improving educational opportunity for Native American and Alaska Native students 
with special needs. Assessment influences many educational decisions, including 
placement in instructional programs, curriculum delivery, teacher and parent

expectations, access to services, and classroom grouping. Johnson (1991) expresses 
concern that "in the absence of fair or non-discriminatory assessment, appropriate 
educational decisions for Native American students with special needs may be seriously 
diminished." 

Johnson (1992) cites a number of studies conducted ovei a 10-year period indicating 
patterns of performance for Native American children that are different from those of 
the majority population. Using such studies to interpret the test performance of Native 
American children may serve to better identify those who couiu benefit from special 
education, and the types of services they need. 

Research studies suggest that language minority-limited English proficient (LM-LEP) 
students are over-represented in special education, particularly within some disability 
categories, such as specific learning disability and speech impairment (Office for Civil 
Rights, 1988; Santos & Santos, 1984). Assessment for at-risk students and for students 
with known disabilities is particularly difficult for LM-LEP students because there are 
few professionals who can administer assessments to Native American children in their 
first language, and because many assessment measures are net valid for this group of 
students. This assessment problem makes it extremely difficult to distinguish between 
language difference and disability. 

Furthermore, the assessment of Native American children is complicated by the limited 
number of instruments which might be useful for students from different language and 
culture groups. Since some of the standardized tests used are biased against Native 
Americans (as well as against other small population groups), their use may contribute 
to self-fulfilling prophecies of low achievement among Native American students 
(Johnson, 1992). The following factors contribute to test bias against Native American 
children: 

• language skill differences; 

• physiological factors (such as poor hearing resulting from otitis 
media); 

• neurological factors (including brain hemispheric preferences); 
and 

• sociocultural factors Qohnson, 1992). 

In addition, some tests may be biased in favor of Native Americans. For example, a 
study of tests commonly used in early identification programs (a kindergarten screening 
battery) showed that these tests were biased in favor of Native Americans by over- 
predicting achievement. The screening battery included the following: the Peabody 
Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised, the Kindergarten Language Screening Test, the 
Developmental Visual-Motor Integration Test, and the McCarthy Draw-A-Child Test. 
When such a test battery, administered at the beginning of the kindergarten year, 
overpredicts achievement and subsequent testing at the end of the year indicates actual 
achievement well below the predicted achievement level, children are then referred to 



?12 

O 16th Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 7 213 

ERJC 



special education based on the apparent discrepancy. Thus, Native American children 
may be inappropriately referred in high numbers and classified as having a learning 
disability. The study clearly indicates that prediction of a Native American child's 
achievement test scores from kindergarten screening tests is more accurate when race 
is taken into account (Stone & Gridley, 1991). 

Based on reports of assessment practices that do not comply adequately with IDEA and 
that do not meet the needs of Native American students with disabilities and those at 
risk, Johnson (1991) suggests consideration of alternative assessment procedures. These 
alternatives include academic task analysis, pluralistic assessment (where norms for 
specific tests are established separately for specific ethnic and socioeconomic groups), 
translation of norm-referenced tests into Native American languages, and use of 
culture-fair tests. Johnson also suggests that school psychologists and special educators 
should become "advocates for the child in scrutinizing critically the social and 
educational context within which the child has developed." Psychologists developing 
new instruments and procedures should formulate an assessment paradigm that 
includes socio-cultural dimensions and strives to eliminate test bias. Johnson's specific 
recommendations to improve assessment practices with Native American children are 
as follows: 

• develop a comprehensive knowledge base of current practices 
in assessment; 

• establish a resource network of persons with expertise in 
testing Native children; 

• modify the assessment process by using the K-ABC or the 
LPAD on a research basis and bring the results to a network of 
professionals who can evaluate the usefulness of the 
instruments; 

• incorporate the advocacy (i.e., home, school, and community 
information) ... and socio-cultural aspects (i.e., work sample 
and analytic teaching) .. to focus attention on achieving valid 
predictions, placements, and educational plans; and 

• obtain thorough knowledge of the child's cultural experience 
and location, which is critical for test interpretation. 

Other recommendations for fair assessment and placement practices, based on a year- 
long study of programs and services for migrant, Hispanic, and Native American 
children in the Yakima Valley of Washington, include the following: 

• using a variety of safeguards to protect children from 
inappropriate placement in special education — a heavy 
reliance on test scores should be replaced with professional 
judgment; 



214 16th Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 7 

ERJC 273 



• involving parents in making decisions about special education 
assessment, placement, and services; 

• schools and community agencies working together to make 
good decisions about placement and services; 

• all special education programs offering appropriate services for 
minority students; and 

• school districts implementing policies regarding identification 
and placement for children with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and 
Fetal Alcohol Effect (Vadasy and Maddox, 1993). 

Information concerning reservation and urban ties, language spoken in the home, and 
participation in traditional customs cnn provide additional knowledge of the ecological 
context, which can influence test performance (Johnson, 1991). 

Dodd, et al. (1992) conducted a study on the vocational readiness of Native American 
high school students with disabilities in Montana. Part of the study involved 
interviews with school psychologists who served schools with large Native American 
populations or who had Native Americans among their clientele. These psychologists 
recognize that using standard assessment measures with Native American children 
requires adaptations and clinical judgment based on knowledge of the Native culture, 
language, and family systems. Furthermore, they confirm the belief that using the 
standard definition for learning disability (i.e., a discrepancy formula) and common 
measures used to do this result in over-identification of Native Americans with learning 
disabilities. 

The relative importance of formal assessment measures and other types of information 
in special education eligibility decisions is a controversial issue. Most of the personnel 
interviewed in a study conducted by Vadasy, Maddox, and Davidson (1992) indicated 
that professional judgment was extremely important in determining eligibility for 
special education programs. Other factors affecting the placement of Native American 
children in these programs are the availability of other program options and services. 
Many of the educators indicated that they preferred placement in Chapter 1 (SOP) to 
placement in special education, so that they can focus more on providing assistance in 
the regular classroom. 



Educational Placement 

IDEA requires students with disabilities to be placed in the least restrictive environment 
appropriate to their individual needs. Data indicate that Native American students 
with disabilities in BIA schools receive special education services in placements that 
differ from placements for all students with disabilities. Native American children 
attending BIA-operated schools are more likely to receive special education services in 
a resource room and are less likely to receive special education services in either a 



6 ( j 

16th Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 7 215 




regular classroom, a separate classroom, or a separate public or private facility (see 
table 7.8). 

Since more than half of Native American children with disabilities experience learning 
disabilities, it is important to look at this specific subgroup. The data in table 7.8 
indicate that more than 82 percent of the students with learning disabilities who attend 
BIA schools receive special education services in a resource room, compared with only 
54 percent of all school-age students with disabilities. Also, in the nation, more than 
22 percent are served in a regular classroom, whereas in BIA schools the proportion is 
approximately 11 percent. Another significant difference between the two groups of 
students with learning disabilities is that only approximately 6 percent are served in 
separate classes in BIA schools, compared to more than 22 percent in the general 
population. 

In BIA schools, the educational environments in which Native American children with 
hearing impairments are served are also significantly different from the environments 
of students with hearing impairments in the nation as a whole (see table 7.8). Hearing 
impairments are a major concern for Native Americans, since, as noted earlier, otitis 
media, which often results in hearing impairment, is far more prevalent among this 
group than in the general population. Furthermore, there is concern that students with 
hearing impairments are underreported and underserved (Johnson, 1991). Among 
those Native American children age 6 through 21 with hearing impairments, nearly 58 
percent received special education services in a public residential facility in school year 
1991-92, compared with 10 percent of these children nationally (U.S. Department of 
Education, 1992). Additional data from the Annual Survey of Hearing Impaired 
Children and Youth, conducted by the Center for Assessment and Demographic Studies 
of Gallaudet University, support this finding. In this survey, 40.1 percent of the Native 
Americans with hearing impairment received special education services in public or 
private residential settings, compared to 23.4 percent of the U.S. population of students 
with hearing impairments (personal communication, OSEP, March, 1993). 

Very little data are available on educational placements for Native American students 
with disabilities in public schools. Across all three age /grade cohorts of students 
excluded from NAEP testing, the majority of all students with disabilities spent more 
than 50 percent of the school day in the mainstream. This pattern was also true for the 
Native Americans included in this group, all of whom attended non-BIA schools 
(NCES, 1992). 



Curriculum 

The development of an appropriate curriculum for Native American students with 
disabilities can be hampered by language and cultural issues. Language development, 
particularly for LM-LEP students, is a major consideration in educating Native 
American children with disabilities. One must take into account that each Native group 
is linguistically different from others and that language development patterns vary 
among Native American groups (Walker, 1987). Difficulties in language for

Native Americans may include phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics. Many 
Native Americans in special education programs are classified with speech impairments 
based on articulation errors which may, in fact, not be considered errors in the student's 
native language or in "Indian English." Walker (1987) provides some recommendations 
to educators for helping Native American LM-LEP students acquire language skills. 
These include: 

• teaching in the clrild's first language to build conceptual skills 
and cognitive development; 

• providing intense English language instruction, beginning at an 
early age; 

• training all professional staff (since few Native American staff 
are available) in the cultural and linguistic characteristics of the 
population they serve; 

• always including language in the IEP, whether or not it is 
listed as the child's primary disability; 

• maintaining the integrity of the child's culture in developing 
the IEP; and 

• considering school history in determining the eligibility of a 
Native child for special education services, rather than relying 
only on tests. 

In the Fifteenth Annual Report to Congress (U.S. Department of Education, 1993), the 
coordination of language and special education services was the focus of an appendix 
on LM-LEP students with disabilities. Important approaches described in that appendix 
that are particularly relevant for the Native American population include involving 
parents, as well as mainstream teachers, in a team approach to service delivery; using 
culturally relevant curricula taught in the primary language; including development of 
English language proficiency in the IEP; and including development of conceptual skills 
in the native language in the IEP. Ortiz et al. (1989) suggest additional instructional 
strategies, such as using contextual clues in presenting new information; building on 
students' prior knowledge; providing linguistic feedback, thereby modeling English; 
promoting on-task behavior by encouraging expressions of children's experience, 
language, and interests; fostering feelings of success; giving children a sense of control 
over their own learning; and teaching holistically, rather than in isolated segments of 
information. 

An issue to consider in designing curricula for Native American special education 
programs is whether or not these programs should be bilingual. Some proponents of 
bilingual instruction believe that using Native American languages as the language of 
instruction and using these languages in social contexts within schools are keys to the 
perpetuation and maintenance of Native American languages and culture, and should 
be encouraged. Critics of this position cite difficulties in determining individuals' 



18

273 



proficiency in Native American languages, the lack of qualified professionals fluent in 
them, the lack of curricular materials, and the socioeconomic effect on Native 
Americans of not teaching or emphasizing English language proficiency (Johnson, 1991). 

One suggestion for helping Native American children, particularly those with learning 
disabilities, achieve reading levels more comparable to their peers is to use materials 
that are culturally relevant. While the diversity of Native American cultures makes this 
difficult to accomplish, the benefits gained in improved reading comprehension scores 
are significant. For students with learning disabilities in particular, it is important that 
they be able to construct meaning from the text using prior knowledge - i.e., the 
knowledge they hold of the real world (ERIC, 1990). 

The adoption by BI A schools of components of "effective schools" models for cultural 
mainstream schools reflects the belief that effective schooling for Native Americans 
must account for students' cultural background (BIA, 1988). The research on effective 
schools presents some features that can be applied directly to Native American 
education. One example comes from a progress report for the 1989-90 school year on 
a pilot program in BIA schools. The project focused on utilizing the effective schools 
research and process as a framework for school improvement. In this project, eight 
correlates of school effectiveness were adopted, including high expectations for 
students, strong instructional leadership, good home/school/community relations, and 
a clear school mission. Twelve BIA schools embarked on programs to establish and 
work toward one or more of the eight gocls. Despite the emphasis on "all" students in 
the goals, however, none of the programs specified any accommodation or specific 
effort for students with disabilities (BIA, 1990a). This study and other reports suggest 
that as BIA schools look to improve educational opportunity for all their students, 
educational opportunity for their students with disabilities can be enhanced by 
specifically including them within the same framework for improvement that they are 
already using. 

Capper (1990, 1992) examined some of the features of the effective school model in two 
studies of preschool special education settings. She reports that the effectiveness of 
schooling in early childhood programs for children with disabilities differs dramatically 
among sites, depending on socioeconomic class, location, and culture. Capper found 
that in classrooms providing services to children with disabilities from upper 
socioeconomic classes, significantly more time was spent in "intentional learning" 
activities and in functional, coordinated activities with clear goals related to future 
educational and societal environments. As the socioeconomic level of students 
decreased, the location of schools moved to more rural settings; and as the culture of 
the students changed from majority to minority, the indicators of effective schooling 
decreased. In her study of five school sites, the site with the fewest indicators of 
effective schooling was a Native American reservation setting located in a remote area. 
The site had the highest rates of unemployment and of individuals living in poverty, 
the lowest educational attainment level, and the highest minority student enrollment. 
Effective school indicators not found in the Native American reservation site included 
high expectations for student achievement and teacher performance (from the principal, 
the district, and the community), clear consensus on priorities for school or classroom 
goals, the ability to recruit and retain the most qualified personnel, adequate

ERIC 



supervision by principals, staff development opportunities, and opportunities for 
professional collaboration. As a result, there was little direct instructional time, a focus 
on administrative rather than instructional activities, and a custodial rather than 
humanistic relationship between teachers and students. 

Furthermore, Capper (1990) found that while schools with high minority enrollment 
acknowledged the need to accommodate cultural differences within the school setting 
in a meaningful way, culture-related activities were not integrated into the curriculum. 
For example, at a reservation school site, Native American holidays were recognized 
in addition to the traditional school holidays, but teaching about them was not 
integrated into the curriculum. Curricular materials were also inappropriate - 
materials used in a speech therapy session depicted white, middle-class, two-parent 
families engaged in social activities unfamiliar to the child. 

Walker (1987) provides recommendations that accommodate both language and cultural 
difference in curriculum development for Native American children with disabilities. 
These include: 

• identifying language abilities in first and second language; 

• identifying the student's preferred learning style, including 
structured /unstructured, individual/group; 

• identifying cultural factors relevant to the child; 

• providing for individualization of instruction; 

• using the child's first language to introduce concepts to young 
children; 

• adapting curricular materials to make sure that they 
complement local community norms and expectations; and 

• incorporating research results into planning, as research results 
become available. 



Instructional Methods 

There is little empirical evidence supporting adoption of a set of teaching practices that 
are effective specifically for Native Americans with disabilities. As a result, it is not 
possible to recommend a specific set of strategies. It is possible, however, to refer to 
research and literature that support instructional approaches that address some of the 
educational factors relevant to Native American education cind to teaching students 
with disabilities in school settings. This section presents factors that might be 
considered in. designing and delivering curriculum and instructional programs in this 




220 16th Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 7 

280 



conlext. In addition, some suggestions from the literature as to how cultural factors can 
be accommodated in schools and in classroom practice are presented. 

In a literature summary on Native American learning styles, Swisher (1991) suggests 
that Native Americans' culture, particularly in child-rearing practices and in patterns 
of verbal and non-verbal communication between adults and children, contribute to a 
Native learning style that is not well-suited to some of the common practices in "Anglo" 
education. 

One suggested way of adapting schooling to Native cultures is by using so-called 
"discovery" methods. Among Native Americans, a self-exploratory approach is the 
cultural norm. In a school setting, therefore, non-interference and autonomy may be 
valued more than directed instruction, which may appear to the Native American child 
as an interference in his/her personal affairs - i.e., his/her learning tasks (Cox & 
Ramirez, 1981). 

In Native American culture, observation is the essential tool of learning. Asking 
questions is not a normal part of learning in day-to-day life, but is reserved for school 
Native American children learn from parents by close proximity and observation, rather 
than by verbal instruction; informal learning tends to be largely non-verbal. Children 
learn by progressively increasing participation in physical activity, rather than by verbal 
instruction. Learning by physical activity is also reflected in Native American 
children's expectation for physical movement. In general, they are accustomed to more 
freedom of movement than is typically permitted (Henry & Pepper, 1990). 

These differences between American schooling and Native American learning styles 
have resulted in the placement of Native American children in situations that favor 
those who are highly verbal and talkative. As a rule, Native American children learn 
faster when the teaching style uses a concrete approach, moving from concrete to 
abstract, from practice to theory (Johnson, 1991). 

One way to implement some of the instructional concepts described above would be 
to adopt cooperative learning techniques, which have been shown to be effective with 
many small population groups, underachieving students, and students who have mild 
cognitive disabilities. This approach could be conducted in informal settings, with the 
opportunity for freedom of physical movement. From studies of other groups, and 
from the characteristics observed among Native American children, the use of group 
problem-solving strategies at the elementary school level would seem to be a promising 
approach. In mathematics, using manipulatives in this setting would also be supported 
Qohnson, 1991; Schindler & Davison, 1985). 

Another method of adapting instruction to learning styles that seems more congruent 
to Native American culture is the initial presentation of new information in a 
visual/spatial mode, rather than a verbal mode. Included in this approach are the use 
of metaphors, images, analogies, and symbols rather than dictionary-type definitions, 
which are more verbal and abstract. Other methods suggested are creative dramatics, 
role-playing, and visuals rather than more abstract forms of instruction such as having 
students construct questions (Johnson, 1991). 

281 



^ 16m Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 7 

ERIC 



A cultural difference that literature suggests should be addressed in developing 
classroom procedures and practices is the concept of discipline and its development in 
the child. For most Native American people, childhood is characterized by discovering 
the world through experimentation and testing. Their concept of discipline is quite 
different from the European-oriented view; it emerges as a result of experience and the 
freedom to make many of one's own choices and decisions. Therefore, while discipline 
imposed by parents may seem to be lacking by European standards, self-discipline 
instead emerges earlier in the Native American child (Henry & Pepper, 1990). 

Cultural differences such as these should be recognized and used as a basis for 
designing instructional methods that enhance the effectiveness of schooling for all 
Native American children. These cultural considerations are even more crucial for 
those children with disabilities if they interfere with academic performance (Johnson, 
1991). Despite similarities among Native Americans, however, educators have to be 
careful not to stereotype them, as there is wide diversity among Native Americans as 
individuals, and among the many Native cultures (Henry & Pepper, 1990). 

While recognizing that there is not a uniform "Native American culture," participants 
in the 1985 Symposium on Exceptional American Indian Children and Youth Qohnson 
& Ramirez, 1987) noted the importance of including Native American culture in every 
aspect of instruction. Areas where culture should be incorporated in research, planning 
and development include: (1) training professionals to work specifically with Native 
American exceptional children; (2) assessment and diagnostic methods and materials; 
(3) instructional methods and curricular materials; (4) programs for parents and 
children; (5) research on learning style; and (6) recognizing the need for equity in 
considerations given to other language /cultural minority students. 



Availability of Adequately Trained Personnel 

There is an acute shortage of personnel qualified to provide .special education services 
to Native American students with disabilities. This section will discuss personnel needs 
and programs available to address those needs. 

Dr. Robert Davila, the former Assistant Secretary for the Office of Special Education and 
Rehabilitative Services, maintained "minority students are directly and positively 
affected by the presence of minority teachers in the classroom. Children with 
disabilities from minority backgrounds need role models every bit as much as other 
children' 1 (Davila, 1991). A great need exists for fully qualified special education 
professionals in programs for Native Americans. Rural districts typically have poor 
resources, low salaries, and few attractive amenities. Schools with these characteristics 
located on or near Native American reservations (BIA, tribal, or public) are among the 
last to attract qualified special education staff. 

A controversial issue in educating Native American students relates to tribal 
uniqueness. While some individuals feel students should be educated by individuals 
from their own tribes, not all Native American educators support the position of "tribal 




222 



16th Annual Report To Congress: Chapter 7 



282 



uniqueness" as it affects teaching personnel. At a symposium on Native American 
education held in April 1993 at the annual meeting of the American Educational 
Research Association, the Native American researchers on the panel concluded that due 
to sufficient similarity among Native cultures (and common differences from Anglo 
culture), there were significant benefits in having even Native teachers from other tribes 
teach Native children (Swisher et al., 1993). 

The shortage of trained special education professionals in BIA-operated schools is 
particularly acute. During school year 1990-91, the BIA employed 297 special education 
teachers for all disability categories, but needed to increase this number by 
approximately 60 percent (another 177 fully qualified teachers) to meet the needs of the 
Native American students with disabilities that it served. In the same year, the nation 
as a whole needed only 9 percent more special education teachers. In some disability 
categories, the shortage of special education personnel to teach Native American 
students is even more severe. An increase of 83 percent in personnel trained in 
teaching students with mental retardation is needed. Currently, the BIA has no special 
educators with training in teaching students with deaf-blindness or with other health 
impairments. There are 2 teachers trained to serve students with hearing impairments 
where at least 20 more are needed, and only 1 teacher trained to serve students with 
visual impairments where 15 more are needed. These shortages are based on personnel 
vacancies and on positions that are not currently filled by fully qualified staff (U.S. 
Department of Education, 1992). There is significant demand in the entire country for 
bilingual sp;cial education personnel, but the need for Native American bilingual 
personnel is even more severe (Baca, 1987). 

Baca (1987) suggests that the desire to work with the population and the ability to work 
effectively with Native American parents are key elements for successful personnel. 
In addition, competency in developing appropriate IEPs, sensitivity to the language and 
culture of Native American students, the ability to teach ESL, the ability to conduct 
non-biased assessments, and the development and use of appropriate materials are 
critical. 

One way to develop the competencies required for teaching Native American 
exceptional children is to encourage more Native Americans to become teachers. In 
1989, 13 percent of the bachelor's degrees earned by Native Americans were in 
education. Education was the second most frequently obtained bachelor's degree for 
Native American women. One in three of the master's degrees awarded to Native 
Americans was in education (divided approximately equally between men and women), 
as were 39 percent of the doctorates (O'Brien, 1992). One consideration for this training 
is that programs at State universities may not be as effective in developing Native 
American special edu-?tors as programs based within Native American communities. 
It appears that Native Americans who attend State universities tend to accept better- 
paying jobs in cities and other locations rather than return to reservations. Also, most 
State university programs are not designed to meet the specific needs of the reservation 
(Baca, 1987). 

Swisher et al. (1993) discussed the role of ethnicity in the training of Native American 
teachers. None of the Native American teachers included in their case studies of 



283 



reservation teachers had Native American faculty in their teacher preparation programs, 
yet all believed that having at least one would have been extremely beneficial to them. 
The teachers expressed their concern over the lack of indigenous teachers who could 
serve as role models. They felt that, in addition to serving as role models, Native 
American teachers are better able to communicate with Native students, regardless of 
whether or not the teachers and students are of the same tribe. 

Some effort has gone into improving the access of Native Americans with disabilities 
to higher education. Dodd and Rose (1991) found that the instructors in tribally 
controlled colleges had adequate background and knowledge about the culture, but no 
background in providing instruction to Native students with disabilities. Furthermore, 
there were no professionals knowledgeable about learning disabilities available to teach 
instructors how to accommodate these students. To assist these instructors, Dodd and 
Rose developed a handbook with a list of explanations and instructional practices that 
are helpful for Native Americans students with learning disabilities at tribally 
controlled colleges. The suggestions in their handbook (e.g., using advance organizers, 
hands-on demonstrations, and cooperative learning) are noteworthy in that they do not 
differ from a list one might suggest to instructors of any students with learning 
disabilities, regardless of their cultural background or age. Wright (1992) lists many 
recommendations for improving the status of Native Americans participating in higher 
education; one of these is "proactive affirmative action to attract more Natives to 
become educators." 

Despite such efforts, however, data confirm an extreme shortage of Native American 
professional educators, or those with specific training in the "sociocultural processes 
operating in Indian commuxuties and classrooms." The research suggests that it is 
easier and more effective to provide a tribal member with "standard teacher training" 
than it is to teach an outsider the tribal language and culture (ERIC, 1989). Despite the 
identified need for professionals with a thorough understanding of Native American 
language and culture, a study of small, rural schools found few professional staffers 
who were either Native American or had this background (Vadasy et al., 1992). 

This professional shortage may also account for the staffing pattern found in many BIA- 
operated schools. Unlike non-Native public schools, which employ State-certified 
professional teachers as the largest proportion of their staff (more than 53 percent), BIA- 
operated schools employ many more aides as full-time personnel (BIA, 1988). Although 
nearly all those employed as teachers are State certified, they comprise only about 17 
percent of full-time education personnel. The BIA also employs approximately 1,000 
"education specialists" with teaching duties included in their jobs. The ratio of aides 
to students is 1 to 19 in BIA schools, but 1 to 129 in public schools. This staffing 
pattern may occur as a result of difficulties in training, recruiting, and retaining 
professionals. It may also contribute to the different special education placement 
patterns observed in comparing BIA schools to the rest of the country. 

In FY 1990, the National Advisory Council on Indian Education funded 14 applications, 
totaling more than $2 million, under the Educational Personnel Development Program 
to provide training to Native American/Alaska Native students for careers in 



224 16m Annum Room To Congmss: Chapter 7

284 



education. The ultimate goal of this project is to train education personnel who will 
serve the Native American community (NACIE, 1991). 

OSEPs Division of Personnel Preparation (DPP) funds two types of projects for Native 
Americans. "Native American Projects" provide grants to tribal colleges to train Native 
Americans to serve children with disabilities. In each funded project, part of the 
curriculum focuses on incorporating the language and culture of Native Americans into 
the education of Native American students with disabilities. At lease 50 percent of the 
trainees are Native Americans. "Projects Recruiting or Benefitting Native Americans" 
is for special education personnel preparation programs designed to recruit Native 
Americans. In the last two fiscal years, funding has been divided about equally 
between these two types of projects. Both types of projects cover multi-year periods, 
and have ranged in funding level from $48,415 per year to $143,335 per year. 

Examples of new Native American Project applications funded in 1992 include: 

• A grant to Northern Arizona University to train 60 students in 
special education at an on-site program on the Navajo Indian 
Reservation. The program will include classroom training in 
special education, training related to working effectively in 
rural areas, working in a collaborative model, and learning the 
cultural attributes of the people in the area. Training will be 
accomplished through regular academic work, by working in 
classrooms on the site, and by assignment to host families in 
the Native American community who will instruct students in 
the culture. 

• A grant to the American Indian Resource Center in Tahlequah, 
Oklahoma, in cooperation with Northeastern State University 
and the Cherokee Nation, to train 26 special education teachers 
of Native American descent for careers as special education 
teachers. The program will include both academic preparation 
and practicum experiences focused on providing services to 
Native American children with disabilities. 

New Projects Recruiting or Benefitting Native Americans for 1992 included an award 
to San Jose State University to recruit and train minority teachers to serve multicultural 
students with hearing impairments. This project will provide stipends to 40 students 
from various ethnic groups to teach students with hearing impairments and deafness. 
Funds will also be used to revise and expand course offerings to include multicultural 
issues, and to provide this information to working teachers through in-service training 
(U.S. Department of Education, 1992). 

In addition to these projects, in 1991 DPP funded a five-year technical assistance project 
to develop, improve, and increase the participation of historically under-represented 
ethnic populations in special education training programs. Under this award, the 
University of New Mexico's Outreach Alliance 2000 Project collaborates with other 
institutions to enhance their ability to prepare successful personnel preparation-related

applications under IDEA funding, particularly for historically under-represented ethnic 
populations (Baker, 1992). 



SUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS 

As this chapter reveals, there is a significant lack of research on Native American 
populations, including research on needs and on effective practices for Native American 
children with disabilities; a broader research base for the Native American population 
is critically needed. A literature search undertaken to prepare this chapter did not 
uncover a single empirical study on effective instructional practices (or other remedial 
or compensatory programs) for Native Americans with any type of disability. Some 
of the literature suggested that certain programs or practices were effective, but 
presented mo data supporting such assertions. Another difficulty experienced in 
reviewing data sources for this chapter was that Native Americans were often included 
in an "other" race category; therefore, their educational needs and problems were 
undocumented. More consistency in including Native Americans as an identifiable 
group and better sampling methods to support group analysis are needed. 

Even with these suggestions, however, it will be difficult to develop a meaningful 
program of research in special education for Native Americans. Differences among 
tribes make it difficult to generalize results. Most current studies do not differentiate 
results based on tribe or whether Native Americans studied resided on or off 
reservations. To deal with some of the challenges of developing a research program, 
the Indian Nations At Risk Task Force states that one of its five priorities for additional 
funding is to seek legislation authorizing the "establishment of a national research and 
school improvement center for Native education" (NACIE, 1992). 

In addition to the development of a broader research base and the implementation of 
more consistent data collection procedures on the Native American population, 
additional efforts are needed to recruit, train, and employ larger numbers of qualified 
special education personnel. The term "qualified" refers to competence in special 
education and in working effectively with Native Americans. 

Finally, there continues to be confusion and misunderstanding of various agencies' 
responsibilities in providing services to Native American students with disabilities. 
Communication of regulations and policy to all agencies involved, and procedures to 
assist them in collaborative and cooperative efforts are needed.

NOTES FOR APPENDIX A 



Notes to the tables found in Appendix A contain information on the ways in which 
States collected and reported data differently from the OSEP data formats and 
instructions. In addition, the notes provide explanations of significant changes in the 
data from the previous year. The chart below summarizes differences in collecting and 
reporting data for eleven States. These variations affected the way data were reported 
for the IDEA, Part B and the Chapter 1 ESEA (SOP) child counts, and the educational 
environment, personnel employed and needed, exiting and anticipated services 
collections. Additional notes on how States reported data for specific data collections 
follow this chart.

Tables AA1-AA27: Child Count 



IDEA Port B 

Arizona - The State reported that the increase in the number of 3- through 5-year-old 
students served from 1991-92 to 1992-93 was probably the result of an extensive effort 
to assist school districts and Indian reservations in identifying and providing services 
to preschool students. The increase in the number of students with other health 
impairments was probably due to increased service provision to students with attention 
deficit disorder (ADD). 

Arkansas — The State indicated that the increase in the number of students with other 
health impairments who received services under Part B from 1991-92 to 1992-93 was 
probably due to increased service provision to students with ADD. 

Bureau of Indian Affairs - The Bureau of Indian Affairs did not report data for 3- 
through 5-year-old students. The BIA indicated that the responsibility for providing 
preschool services has shifted from the BIA to the tribes. The tribes have assumed 
responsibility for reporting these data. However, procedures for collecting and 
reporting the data have not been implemented. 

Colorado — The State indicated that the increase in the number of 3- through 5-year-old 
students served from 1991-92 to 1992-93 was a result of the implementation of 
Colorado's preschool mandate. 

Connecticut - The State indicated that the increase in the number of students with 
other health impairments from 1991-92 to 1992-93 was probably due to increased 
service provision to students with ADD. 

Georgia - The State indicated that the increase in the number of 3- through 5-year-old 
students served from 1991-92 to 1992-93 was probably due to a legislative mandate 
requiring statewide services for three- and four-year-olds. The primary factors that 
contributed to the increase in the number of students with other health impairments 
were the increased service provision to students with ADD, students with other 
neurologically based impairments where other health impairments eligibility has been 
determined (e.g., tourette's syndrome), and students who need special education but 
do not fit the typical profiles of other categories. 

Illinois — The State did not report counts of students with multiple disabilities. The 
data were presented under the students' primary disabilities. 

Kansas - The State indicated that the increase in the number of students with other 
health impairments who received services under Part B from 1991-92 to 1992-93 was 
probably due to increased service provision to students with ADD and attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder.

eric 



Maryland — The State postulated that the increase in the number of students with other 
health impairments from 1991-92 to 1992-93 was due to increased service provision to 
students with ADD in the 6 through 11 age group. 

Massachusetts — The State indicated that the changes in the number of students with 
various disabilities who received services under Part B were a result of the application 
of a new formula for the distribution of students by disability condition. Massachusetts 
is prohibited by state law from collecting data by disability condition. The addition of 
the new disability conditions, autism and traumatic brain injury, necessitated the 
development of a formula that incorporated these categories. 

Missouri — The State postulated that the increase in the number of students with other 
heaith impairments was due to increased service provision to students with ADD and 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. 

Nebraska - The State combined counts of students with traumatic brain injury with 
counts of students with other health impairments. 

Nevada — The State indicated that the increase in the number of 3- through 5-year-old 
students served from 1991-92 to 1992-93 was a result of the implementation of Nevada's 
preschool mandate. The decrease in the number of students with orthopedic 
impairments and the increase in the number of students with other health impairments 
were due to the modification of the state's disability categories. Nevada commenced 
collection of district-level information on students with other health impairments and 
orthopedic impairments. In the past, Nevada did not collect data on these categories. 
Students in these categories were reported under the physical impairments category. 
Students in the physical impairments category were cross-walked into the Federal 
disabilities categories based on placement indicators. Currently, data on students with 
these disabilities are collected at the district level 

New Hampshire — The State indicated that the increase in the number of students with 
other health impairments from 1991-92 to 1992-93 was probably due to increased 
identification of and service provision to students with ADD. 

New Mexico ~ The State indicated that the increase in the number of students with 
other health impairments from 1991-92 to 1992-93 was partially due to an increase in 
the number of medically fragile students who entered the school system. Another 
contributing factor was a recent growth in the number of preschoolers receiving special 
education services. Many of these preschoolers were identified as having other health 
impairments when they entered elementary school. 

North Carolina - The State indicated that the increase in the number of students with 
other health impairments from 1991-92 to 1992-93 was probably due to increased 
inclusion of students with ADD in the other health impairments category. 

Ohio - The State indicated that the increase in the number of 3- through 5-year-old 
students served from 1991-92 to 1992-93 was probably due to the enactment of a 
preschool mandate. Ohio indicated that the increase in the number of students with 

5G7 

16th Annual Report To Congrb$s: Appbnoix A A-277 

er|c 



other health impairments and the decrease in the number of students with orthopedic 
impairments were primarily due to the separate reporting of data in these categories. 
Prior to the 1992-93 school year students with other health impairments were reported 
in the orthopedic impairment category. 

Tennessee - The State thought that the increase in the number of students with other 
health impairments from 1991-92 to 1992-93 was the result of recent Federal guidelines 
regarding students with ADD and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. 

Virginia — The State postulated that the increase in the number of students with other 
health impairments from 1991-92 to 1992-93 was due to increased service provision to 
students with ADD. 

Wisconsin — The State indicated that the increase in the number of students with other 
health impairments from 1991-92 to 1992-93 was probably due to increased service 
provision to students with ADD and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. 

Chapter 7 (SOP) 

Colorado - The State indicated that the decrease in the number of 3- through 5-year-old 
students who received services under Chapter 1 (SOP) from 1991-92 to 1992-93 was a 
result of its preschool mandate. One result of this mandate was a shifting of the 
majority of preschoolers from state-supported presd ~ol programs to local public school 
programs. 

Illinois - The State did not report counts of students with multiple disabilities. The 
data were presented under the students' primary disabilities. Illinois indicated that the 
increase in the number of birth through 2-year-old students served from 1991-92 to 
1992-93 was probably due to a continuing effort to identify and provide services to 
infants and toddlers with disabilities. The State suggested that the increase in the 
number of students with speech or language disabilities was probably due to an 
increased number of students who became eligible under state categorical 
reimbursements. 

Massachusetts - The State indicated that the changes in the number of students with 
various disabilities who received services under Chapter 1 (SOP) from 1991-92 to 1992- 
93 were due to the application of a new formula for the distribution of students by 
disability condition. Massachusetts is prohibited by state law from collecting data by 
disability condition. The addition of the new disability conditions, autism and 
traumatic brain injury, necessitated the development of a formula that incorporated 
these categories. 

Nebraska - The State combined counts of students with traumatic brain injury with 
counts of students with other health impairments.

New York - The State indicated that the increase in the number of birth through 2- 
year-old students served from 1991-92 to 1992-93 was probably due to the lead agency 
for Part H, the Department of Health, becoming recognized as an Chapter 1 (SOP) 
agency. The State thought that the decrease in the number of students with SED was 
a result of increased monitoring of assessments in New York City, where there had 
been concern over the disproportional number of black students assigned to this 
category. The decrease in the number of students with other health impairments was 
probably due to the separate reporting of students with autism. In the past, students 
with autism had been reported in the other health impairments category. 

Oklahoma - The State indicated that the increase in the number of birth through 2- 
year-old students served from 1991-92 to 1992-93 was probably due to increased 
identification and service provision to infants and toddlers as a result of the 
introduction of uniform standards for identification by the State legislature. 

South Carolina - The State indicated that the increase in the number of birth through 
2-year-old students served from 1991-92 to 1992-93 was probably due to the increased 
identification and service provision to infants and toddlers with disabilities. 

Texas - The State indicated that the decrease in the number of students with multiple 
disabilities from 1991-92 to 1992-93 was a result of more accurate reporting of students 
by disability categories. In the past, many students were incorrectly classified as having 
multiple disabilities. 

Wisconsin - The State indicated that the increase in the number of birth through 2- 
year-old students from 1991-92 to 1992-93 was primarily due to the lead agency for 
Part H, the Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS), becoming eligible for 
Chapter 1 (SOP) funding. 

Tables AB1-AB24: Educational Environments 

Alabama - The State did not report any students in parent-initiated private school 
placements. Alabama did not report placement data for 3-through 5-year-old students. 
The missing data was submitted after the production of this report. 

American Samoa - American Samoa noted that students with mental retardation who 
were served in regular classes and resource rooms had mild disabilities. American 
Samoa has noncategorical eligibility and placement. American Samoa also indicated 
that as a unitary system, i.e., the SEA and LEA are the same, the distinction between 
students served under Chapter 1 (SOP) in state-operated or state-supported programs 
and students served under Chapter 1 (SOP) in local education agency programs was 
not applicable. 

California - The State did not have a mechanism for reporting students served in 
private residential facilities in 1991-92, however, these data were collected in the 1992-93 
school year. California did not report students served in parent-initiated private school

placements and did not report the educational placement of students served under 
Chapter 1 (SOP) in local educational agency programs. 

Illinois — The State did not report counts of students with multiple disabilities. The 
data were presented under the students' primary disabilities. Illinois did not report 
placement data for 3- through 5-year-old students. The State said that it did not collect 
the data necessary to report the educational placement of students who received special 
education services under Chapter 1 (SOP) in local education agencies. 

Indiana — The State indicated that the increase in the number of students served under 
Part B in resource rooms, public separate facilities, and private schools, and the 
decrease in Chapter 1 (SOP) public separate school facility placements from 1990-91 to 
1991-92 were due to legislation passed in 1991 by the Indiana General Assembly that 
required local public school districts to provide services to early childhood (age 3-5) 
students with disabilities. 

Kansas — The State indicated that the shift in homebound /hospital placements from 
Chapter 1 (SOP) to Part B was the result of a state policy encouraging LEAs to serve 
preschool students in local school districts. 

Massachusetts — The State indicated that data were not available for students served 
in parent-initiated private school placements. 

Michigan — The State reported that there are no private separate school facilities within 
the State. 

Minnesota — The State did not report any students served in parent-initiated private 
school placements. 

Missouri — Hie State indicated that sampling was employed in the collection of 
placement data. 

Montana — The State did not report students in parent-initiated private school 
placements. 

North Dakota — The State did not report students in parent-initiated private school 
placements. 

OMo — The State combined placement data for the other health impairments and 
orthopedic impairments categories. The data were presented under the orthopedic 
impairments category. Ohio did not report students in parent-initiated private school 
placements. State law prohibits districts from placing students in private residential 
facilities. Ohio indicated that the increase in Part B resource room placements and the 
decrease in Part B separate class placements were due to efforts by the state to serve 
students in more integrated settings. Ohio also stated that the decrease in the 
Chapter 1 (SOP) public separate school facility placements was a result of Ohio's 
preschool mandate, i.e., this mandate has resulted in more preschool students receiving 
services in resource rooms rather than in separate facilities.

Oregon - The State did not report any students in parent-initiated private school 
placements. 

Puerto Rico - Puerto Rico did not report placement data for 3- through 5-year-old 
students. 

Texas - The State did not report students in correctional facilities. Texas indicated that 
they were unable to report placement data for students who received services under 
Chapter 1 (SOP) in state-operated or state-supported programs separately from students 
who received services under Chapter 1 (SOP) in local educational agency programs. 
They stated that approximately 80 percent of Chapter 1 (SOP) students receive services 
in local educational agency programs. 

Wyoming - The State did not report placement data for 3- through 5-year-old students. 
The State did not report students in parent-initiated private school placements. 



Tables AC1-AC3: Personnel 

Personnel Employed 

Illinois - The State combined counts of teachers of students having other health 
impairments and teachers of students having serious emotional disturbance. The data 
were presented under the latter category. Illinois did not include data on teachers of 
students with deaf-blindness because students with deaf-blindness were combined with 
either students with hearing impairments or students with visual impairments. Illinois 
did not report counts of work-study coordinators. The State indicated that the increase 
in the number of counselors from 1990-91 to 1991-92 was probably due to a change in 
the City of Chicago reporting procedures for this category. 

Kansas - The State combined counts of teachers of students with deaf-blindness with 
teachers of students with multiple disabilities and presented the da*a under the 
multiple disabilities category. Student counts were combined in the same fashion. 

Massachusetts - The State is prohibited by State law from collecting data by disability 
condition. The State reported all teachers as serving students in cross-categorical 
classrooms. Massachusetts did not report counts of work-study coordinators, 
audiologists, recreation therapists, other diagnostic staff, supervisors /administrators 
(SEA), and non-professional staff. 

Michigan - The State did not report counts of other diagnostic staff, counselors, and 
non-professional staff. 

Minnesota The State indicated that the increase in the number of v vocational education 
teachers from 1990-91 to 1991-92 was probably due to an expansion of the category to 
include other vocational staff that work with special needs students, e.g., evaluation 
and placement specialists. 



Oil 

j: 16th Annual Report To Congress: Appendix A A-28 1 



Montana - All Montana schools use cross-categorical spedal education classrooms. 
Therefore, the full-time equivalencies of the teachers employed to serve students with 
each disability are an estimate based on contact hours per week. 

New York — The State combined counts of teachers of students with deaf-blindness 
with teachers of students with multiple disabilities. The data were presented under the 
multiple disabilities category. Also, the State did not report data for personnel 
employed as vocational education teachers, work-study coordinators, school social 
workers, other diagnostic staff, counselors, and non-professional . staff . New York 
indicated that the decrease in the number of physical education teachers employed to 
serve students with disabilities was probably due to more accurate reporting. In the 
past, school districts reported the number of positions instead of reporting the number 
of FTE employed. 

Northern Marianas - The Northern Marianas -only reported counts of teachers serving 
students in cross-categorical classrooms. 

Ohio - Prior to the 1992-93 school year, the State did not report counts of teachers of 
students with other health impairments because students with other health impairments 
were reported in the orthopedic impairment category. 

Oregon - The State indicated that the increase in the number of teacher aides from 
1990-91 to 1991-92 was probably due to the expanded use of instructional assistants to 
support educational efforts. 

South Dakota - The State reported all teachers as serving students in two categories: 
speech or language impairments and cross categorical programs. The State indicated 
that the decrease in the total number of personnel employed reflected efforts by the 
SEA to get LEAs to report the FTE personnel providing special education services 
rather than the total number of personnel. 

Texas - The State reported all teachers as serving students with hearing impairments, 
speech-language impairments, or as serving students in cross-categorical classrooms. 

Washington - The State reported all teachers as serving students in two categories: 
speech or language impairments and cross-categorical programs. Washington also did 
not report counts of vocational education teachers, physical education teachers, work- 
study coordinators, audiologists, recreation therapists, and other diagnostic staff. 

Wisconsin - The State combined the counts of teachers of students with other health 
impairments with teachers of students with orthopedic impairments. The data were 
presented under the orthopedic impairments category. Wisconsin reported the count 
of teachers of students with multiple disabilities under the count of teachers of students 
in cross-categorical programs. 

Wyoming - The State did not report counts of vocational education teachers and 
work-study coordinators because the State does not fund these positions for special 
education.

Personnel Needed 



Illinois - The State combined counts of teachers of students having other health 
impairments and teachers of students having SED. The data were presented under the 
latter category. Also, Dlinois did not include data on teachers of students with 
deaf-blindness because students with deaf-blindness were combined with either 
students with hearing impairments or students with visual impairments. 

Kansas — The State combined counts of teachers of students with deaf-blindness with 
teachers of students with multiple disabilities and presented the data under the 
multiple disabilities category. Student counts were combined in the same fashion. 

Maryland - The State did not report counts of work-study coordinators, counselors, 
and supervisors /administrators (SEA). 

Massachusetts - The State only reported counts of teachers serving students in cross- 
categorical classrooms due to state law prohibiting data collection by disability. 
Massachusetts also did not report counts of work-study coordinators, audiologists, 
teacher aides, recreation therapists, other diagnostic staff, supervisors /administrators 
(SEA), and non-professional staff. The State indicated that the decrease in the number 
of teachers needed was probably due to efforts by the State to report more accurate 
data. 

Michigan - The State did not report counts of other diagnostic staff, counselors, and 
non-professional staff. 

Minnesota - The State did not report teachers of students with multiple disabilities 
because students with multiple disabilities were reported under the students' primary 
disabilities. 

Montana — Montana schools use only cross-categorical special education classrooms. 
Therefore, the counts of teachers needed to provide special education services were 
reported under cross-categorical programs. 

New York - The State combined counts of teachers of students with deaf-blindness 
with teachers of students with multiple disabilities. The data were presented under the 
multiple disabilities category. 

North Dakota - The State only reported counts of teachers of students in the disability 
categories of mental retardation, speech or language impairments, visual impairments, 
SED, and learning disabilities. North Dakota also did not report counts of physical 
education teachers, work-study coordinators, occupational therapists, audiologists, 
recreation therapists, other diagnostic staff, physical therapists, 
supervisors /administrators (SEA), and non-professional staff. 

Ohio - Prior to the 1992-93 school year, the State did not report counts of teachers of 
students with other health impairments because students with other health impairments 
were reported in the orthopedic impairment category.

South Dakota — The State reported all teachers as serving students in two categories: 
speech or language impairments and cross categorical programs. The State indicated 
that the decrease in the total number of personnel needed reflected efforts by the SEA 
to get LEAs to report the FTE personnel providing special education services rather 
than the total number of personnel. 

Table AD1 and AD2: Exiting 

California — The State indicated that the changes in the number of students with 
various disabilities exiting the educational system from 1990-91 to 1991-92 were a result 
of the use of an unit record system to collect and report data at the disability level. In 
the past, the total number of students exiting were apportioned among the disability 
categories according to their distribution in the child count. 

Colorado — The State indicated that the reported data represents students who exited 
during a six-month period. 

Connecticut — The State indicated that calculation and coding errors resulted in 
information being submitted for the 1990-91 and 1991-92 school years that substantially 
exceeded the actual dropout rate. Corrected data addressing these issues were 
submitted after the production of the tables in this report. 

Illinois - The State did not report exiting data for students with multiple disabilities. 
The data were presented under the students' primary disabilities. 

Massachusetts — The State did not collect data for "graduation through certificate or 
completion of IEP requirement" because all students graduate with diplomas. The State 
did not collect data for "status unknown." Massachusetts is prohibited by state law 
from collecting data by disability. Assignment to disabilities is based on a formula. 

New Jersey — The State did not report exiting data for 14- and 15-year-old students 
because state law mandates that students cannot leave the educational system until they 
are 16 years old. New Jersey did not collect data for "graduation through certification 
or completion/ fulfillment of IEP requirement" since all students who graduate receive 
a diploma. The State indicated that exiting data represented a weighted sample 
comprised of half of the school districts in the state. Each school district reports exiting 
data every other year. The three largest districts report exiting data every year. 

Ohio — The State coribined exiting data for the other health inpayments and 
orthopedic impairments categories. The data were presented under the orthopedi . 
impairments category. 

Pennsylvania — The State indicated that "graduation with a certificate" was not a valid 
basis of exit in the State.

NOTES FOR IDEA, PART H DATA 



Notes for State data on infants and toddlers served under the Part H program (as 
reported in Chapter 2) contain information on the ways States collected and reported 
data differently from the OSEP data collection formats and instructions. Year-to-year 
changes have not been tracked for data other than child count because many States had 
not yet fully implemented Part H. 

Counts of Infants and Toddlers Served (1992-93) 

Pennsylvania — The December 1 child count for the Chapter 1 program included 47 
children counted exclusively under P.L. 99-457. 

Vermont - The number of children waiting services was actually the number of 
estimated children eligible for Part H services. There was no waiting list for entry to 
services. 

Early Intervention Services (1991-92) 

California — Other early intervention services included vision services and assistive 
technology services. The State reported that the count of early intervention services 
provided was complicated due to the collection of data across departments. 
Confidentiality requirements made it impossible to accurately determine the overlap in 
clients and service counts between the Departments of Education (CDE) and 
Developmental Services (DDS). Consequently, the State was unable to provide an 
accurate, unduplicated count. Departments 7 data systems have different definitions of 
the specific services required by OSEP. The methods by which services are captured 
and coded vary between departments. Not all services provided to a client would 
necessarily be available in a State-level database. Not all services provided by local 
educational agencies were reported to CDE. Only the first four services provided were 
available in State databases. For DDS, only services purchased through a vendored 
program would be captured in the DDS data systems, while services provided at the 
DDS regional centers would be identified in the client's case records and were not 
directly available for counting. Each department uses a few reporting codes to report 
more than one early intervention service. The lead agency made assumptions for 
grouping service codes in order to complete this report. 

Colorado — Other early intervention services included assistive technology devices 
services and vision services. 

Connecticut - Other services included translators, play groups for siblings, and 
parenting groups. 



576 



A-286 16th Annual Report To Congress: Appendix A 



Florida - Counts did not include data from the Florida Department of Health and 
Rehabilitative Services (HRS), which served the largest portion of this target population. 



Kentucky - The count of children receiving services was based on a March 1, 1992 
coMnt rather than December 1. 

Massachusetts — The State did not provide early intervention services based upon 
provider categories. Rather, all disciplines may provide State-defined early intervention 
services. For the purposes of this table, service allocation was determined primarily by 
the ratio of specific discipline to total number of staff. 

Michigan - Data on services were estimated. Michigan assumed that the 1991 and 1992 
populations and services were approximately the same and weighted the data from a 
partial count of children in 1992 on the basis of 1991 counts. 

Minnesota - Data were not available. 

Missouri — Other early intervention services included vision services. 

Montana — Other early intervention services included support coordination. 

New Hampshire - Other early intervention services included transdisciplinary services. 

New Jersey - Services were reported under Chapter 1. 

North Carolina - Data were reported only from eight of the 41 area early intervention 
programs. 

Washington — These numbers represented two months of Year 4 participation. 

Wisconsin - Other early intervention services included vision services and assistive 
technology. Data did not reflect all early intervention services under public 
supervision. Some county and city public health agencies provided services to this 
population as well. Respite care was provided outside of the early intervention system. 
Speech and language pathology was not identified as a separate service in Chapter 1 
data. Therefore, the data have been extrapolated from the primary diagnosis. Other 
agencies providing early intervention services that were not included in these reports 
were not "under public supervision" in that they were not under contract with the 
county. 

Service Settings (1991-92) 

California - Accurate age breakouts were not available. Current procedures for local 
reporting of data complicated the determination of the primary location in which 
services are provided. The California Education Code, for example, required that 
infants and toddlers receive both home-ba^d and group-based (i.e., center-based) 

57? 

O 16th Annual Report To Congress: Appendix A A-287 

ERIC 



services, although the specific amount of time in each location was not reported to the 
State. As a general practice, infants up to age 18 months were to receive services 
primarily in the home. Therefore, for the purposes of this report, infants under the age 
of one year were reported as receiving services in a home-based setting. For the 
Department of Developmental Services (DDS), many children receive services regularly 
and primarily in an Infant Development Program. These children were reported under 
the category of early intervention classroom/center. All other DDS clients under age 
three received at least some services at the regional centers, although they may also 
receive one or more vendored services at other locations. These children were reported 
under the category of outpatient service facility. The State was unable to provide an 
unduplicated count because confidentiality and data system requirements precluded an 
accurate count. Furthermore, counts for DDS clients were not broken down by age, 
although, as noted, education settings are essentially age-specific. 

Florida — Other settings included Redlands Migrant Association and subsidized child 
care. 

Georgia — Other settings included Department of Family and Children's Services, 
private child care center, city library, and Department of Mental Health and Mental 
Retardation Services. 

Kentucky — Data did not include home sites or other off-agency sites. 

Massachusetts — Virtually all families enrolled receive services in a variety of settings 
appropriate to the families needs and desires. This cannot be shown without 
duplicating the count. All placements reported in home. 

Michigan — Data on services were estimated. Michigan assumed that the 1991 and 1992 
populations and services were approximately the same and weighted the data from a 
partial count of children in 1992 on the basis of 1991 counts. 

Minnesota — Minnesota did not have a system in place which enabled the State to 
determine breakdowns of children being served by age in various settings. 

New Hampshire — Counts by discrete ages were not available. 

New Jersey — Settings were reported under Chapter 1 (SOP). 

Washington — These numbers represent two months of Year 4 Part H participation. 
The residential setting is not used for infants in Washington. 

Wisconsin — Data were estimated based on location of special education only. Different 
services may be offered to a specific child or family in different settings. In order to 
accurately report this information, the setting needs to be coded for each individual 
service. For the Chapter 1 (SOP) programs, the data represent the primary setting in 
which children and families receive most of their services. The State was unable to 
break out the settings by age groups, although the State is aware that many center- 
based programs offer a home-based model for children under 18 months.

ERJC 



586 



This appendix summarizes the specific evaluation activities supported by Special 
Studies monies from 1976 through the present. All Special Studies contracts are listed 
and brief descriptions provided. The studies have been designed to provide 
information concerning the impact and effectiveness of the IDEA, formerly EHA.

Title Contract Number and Amount 

1. Assessment of State Information Management Analysis 9/30/76 - 9/30/77 
Capabilities under P.L. 94-142 Center (MAC), Inc. $298,840 

Cambridge, MA 
300-76-0562 

Description : The purpose of this study was to determine the States' capacities to 
respond to the new reporting requirements inherent in P.L. 94-142. MAC analyzed the 
data requirements in the law and the reporting forms being developed by program staff. 
After visiting 27 States to test their capacity to respond, MAC reported on State capacity 
to provide information in four categories: children, personnel, facilities, and resources. 
They found that capacity was relatively high in the first category and decreased across 
the remaining categories. They recommended deleting requirements for fiscal data, since 
States could not respond adequately to such requests. 

2. Development of a Sampling SRI International 10/1/76 - 9/30/77 
Procedure for Validating State Menlo Park, CA $267,790 
Counts of Handicapped Children 300-76-0513 

Description : The purpose of this study was to develop a sampling plan and a method 
that could be used by program staff to validate the State counts. SRI International 
evaluated all previously available data on the incidence of children with disabilities and 
concluded that the data reported by States were at least as accurate as other data 
sources, if not more so. SRI concluded that procedures for validating the information 
should be incorporated into the counting procedures themselves. SRI developed a 
handbook showing States how to do this. 

3. An Analysis of Categorical Council for Exceptional 10/1/76 - 9/30/77

Classification of Handicapped 

Children 

Description : The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which State 
policies (a) provided for services to children with disabilities other than those provided 
for under IDEA, Part B, or (b) used varying definitions or eligibility criteria for the same 
categories of children. CEC found that neither of the types of children served nor the 
definitions varied widely. However, there were some instances in which eligibility 
criteria did vary.

Education Program Portland, OR $433,000 

300-74-7915 

Description : The purpose of this study was to estimate the difficulty of implementing 
the IEP provision of the IDEA. The work was performed by Nero and Associates and 
by internal staff. Four States were visited and a variety of individuals affected by the 
Act were interviewed. The study revealed that (a) similar concerns were identified both 
in States that already had provisions and in those that did not, and (b) similar concerns 
were raised by both special education and regular teachers. The findings were used to 
design technical assistance and in-service training programs. 

5. Analysis of State Data Team Associates 9/29/76 - 9/11/77 

Washington, D.C $192,698 
300-76-0540 9/12/77 - 6/30/78 

$175,396 

Description : The purpose of this study was to analyze data already available from the 
States. The work was performed by TEAM Associates and by internal staff. The State 
data contained all numerical information required in the Act as well as extensive 
information on policies and procedures. Analysis of the information contained in these 
State documents and information obtained from Special Studies form the backbone of 
the Annual Report to Congress.

$250,006 

Description : The purpose of this study was to follow a small sample of school systems 
over a 5-year period to observe their progress in implementing the Act. Because 
Congress asked that the Annual Report describe progress in implementation, this in-depth 
study of processes was designed to complement the national trends reported by States. 
In this study, SRI International described the implementation process for the school 
districts and identified problem areas.

Associates $395,162 
Washington, D.C. 
300-77-0237 

Description : This study was designed to lay the groundwork for future studies of the 
quality and effectiveness of P.L. 94-1 42's implementation. It was conducted by internal 
staff with the assistance of Thomas Buffington Associates. The study focused on four 
principal requirements of the law: provision of due process, least restrictive placements, 
individualized education programs, and prevention of erroneous classification. The 
study solicited 15 position papers on evaluation approaches for each requirement for 
LEA self-study guides. Four monographs addressing the evaluation of these four 
provisions of the law were produced. Each monograph included the relevant papers and 
a review by a panel of education practitioners.

300-77-0529 10/1/79 - 10/30/80 

$125,181 

Description : The purpose of this study was to determine the nature and quality of the 
individualized education programs being designed for children with disabilities. These 
programs are at the heart of the service delivery system, and the Congress asked for a 
survey of them. RTI spent the 1977-78 school year designing a sampling plan and 
information-gathering techniques. Data collected in school year 1978-79 provided 
descriptive information about IEP documents. The study found mat 95 percent of 
children with disabilities have IEPs. Most IEPs meet minimal requirements of the Act, 
except for the evaluation component. 

9. A Descriptive Study of Teacher Roy Littlejohn & 7/9/76 - 10/30/78 
Concerns Said to be Related to Associates $328,758 
P.L. 94-142 Washington, D.C. 

Description : The purpose of this study was to assess the array of concerns raised by 
teachers regarding the effects of the Act on their professional responsibilities. Several 
concerns were raised by teachers during the course of the FY 1976 study on the 
implementation of the individualized education program, and several have been raised 
by national teachers 7 organization. Roy Littlejohn & Associates organized the concerns 
into general types and analyzed the relationships between these categories of concerns 
and the requirements of the Act. They visited six school districts to analyze in detail a 
small number of examples. Recommendations were made for school districts to provide 
teachers with more information about P.L 94-142.

300-77-0528 

Description : The purpose of this study was to assess the first year of implementation 
of the Act. Education Turnkey Systems observed nine local school systems during the 
1977-78 school year and the first half of the 1978-79 school year to determine how 
priorities were established and how implementation decisions were made at each level 
of the administrative hierarchy. P.L. 94-142's implementation was observed to be well 
under way at each LEA despite varying levels of resources and organizational 
differences among sites. Problem areas were identified.

the Classroom Teacher Philadelphia, PA $24,767 

300-77-0525 

Description : The purpose of this project was to provide regular teachers with accurate 
information about P.L. 94-142 and its probable effects on their classrooms. A fie Id- tested 
guide entitled Clarification of P.L. 94-142 for the Classroom Teacher was produced by 
Research for Better Schools for this purpose. The guide contains (1) a self-evaluation 
pretest; (2) an explanation of the law, its background, purpose, and major provisions; (3) 
questions most frequently asked by teachers about P.L. 94-142 and their answers; (4) 
activities to help classroom teachers prepare themselves and their students for 
implementation of the law; and (5) two appendices, one containing the P.L. 94-142 
regulations, and the other an annotated bibliography.

ment of Handicapped Children Silver Spring, MD 

300-78-0427 

Description : The purpose of this study was to investigate the rules or criteria used by 
the courts and State hearing officers to determine the placements of children with 
disabilities, the guidance given by States to school districts in making placement 
decisions, and the actual placement procedures used by school districts. Placement 
decision rules and interpretations of the Act's least restrictive environment requirement 
were compared across arenas. Exemplary practices at the State and local educational 
agency levels were described.

Description : The purpose of this project in its early years was to analyze data already 
available from States. State data submitted to OSEP each year contain all numerical 
information required in the Act as well as extensive information on policies and 
procedures. State data were analyzed throughout the years of the contract period for 
dissemination to the field and for inclusion in the Annual Report to Congress. 

The current project expands on the prior technical assistance contract. The purposes of 
the project are to (1) assist OSEP in developing the capacity to collect and analyze valid, 
reliable, and comparable data for reporting, program planning, and evaluation; (2) 
conduct studies to analyze significant and emerging issues in special education; (3) assist 
OSEP in providing guidance to State and local educators regarding educational reform 
issues; (4) assist States to build the capacity to collect valid and reliable data and to 
perform evaluations of the impact and effectiveness of services provided under IDEA; 
(5) facilitate information exchanges among Federal, State, and local special educators to 
discuss common concerns and goals; and (6) obtain, organize, and analyze information 
from multiple sources for reporting on the status of IDEA implementation, and the 
impact and effectiveness of IDEA implementation.

Description : This project was designed to provide information on potential future 
changes in values, economics, social institutions, technology, and medicine that may 
affect the provision of services to children with disabilities. In 1978, at a conference held 
by Newtek Corporation, experts in those five areas discussed the trends and the 
implications of those trends with panel members representing various aspects of services 
to children with disabilities. Although in many cases the projected trends were too 
speculative to guide policy making, the conference highlighted some potentially 
important trends about which policy makers should be aware. A summary of the 
conference was published in Focus on Exceptional Children.

300-78-0128 

Description : States that provide clear and convincing evidence that all children with 
disabilities have a free appropriate public education available to them may receive a 
partial waiver of the law's fiscal nonsupplant requirement. A six-month study was 
undertaken by Planning and Human Systems in 1978, to develop guidelines to be vised 
in reviewing a State's request for a waiver. Development of the guidelines was based 
on (1) an evaluation of experiences in conducting a review of a request by Massachusetts 
for a waiver in 1978; (2) information provided by Federal, State, and local agencies and 
by State consumer, advocacy, and professional associations; and (3) a review of 
monitoring procedures used by other Federal agencies.

$179,906 

10/1/82 - 3/31/83 
$ 37,310 

Description : This study described LEA procedures for identifying, assessing, and placing 
students to determine whether or not procedures were in place to prevent the erroneous 
classification of children, particularly misclassification on the basis of rac? or culture. 
AMS collected data from 500 schools in 100 school districts and reviewed selected 
documents for 10,000 individual students. Five topics were addressed: (a) the extent to 
which LEAs use evaluative data such as adaptive behavior and classroom observations 
in their assessments; (b) a comparison of evaluation procedures for minority and 
nonminority students; (c) assessment training needs as identified by the respondents; (d) 
the extent to which school staff members document evaluation decisions; and (e) the 
extent to which school systems have students waiting to be evaluated.

Description : The purpose of this study was to provide information about student flow 
between special and regular education. SRI International (1) described the characteristics 
of children leaving special education and the reasons for their departure, (2) identified 
the extent to which children with disabilities transfer successfully into regular education 
programs, and (3) identified children who may receive treatment of short duration and 
therefore may not be receiving services when Federal counts are taken.

Description : This project investigated the legal issues surrounding the surrogate parent 
requirement of P.L. 94-142 and explored as many approaches as possible for responding 
to these issues. The Federation for Children with Special Needs held a conference in 
July 1979 that included four State representatives involved in the legal aspects of 
implementing the parent surrogate requirements, two persons from national 
organizations, and representatives from the General Counsel's Office of HEW, the Justice

several States on their experience in implementing the parent surrogate requirement, and 
independent legal research formed the basis for analyzing the issues involved. The 
analysis was vised to review the need for policy clarification.

first year, TRISTAR conducted two conferences for SEAs, LEAs, and the Regional 
Resource Centers on problems and successful practices in the following areas: child 
count, Child Find, individualized education programs, and interagency cooperation. The 
contractor then provided follow-up technical assistance to participants who requested 
it. In its second year, TRISTAR focused on providing information to educational 
agencies on how to reduce adversarial relationships between parents and schools. 
Technical assistance materials were developed by the project, other resources were 
identified, and a national topical conference was conducted in June 1980.

Description : This study had two parts: an assessment component and a secondary 
school component. The assessment component investigated three processes that 
influence the timeliness with which a school system conducts evaluations for students 
who have been identified as potentially having disabilities: referral /screening, case 
coordination, and quality control. This component of the study was conducted in the 
school districts of three cities of moderate size. A total of 94 personnel involved with 
the evaluation process participated in the study. The secondary school component was 
conducted in two phases. The first phase examined the class schedules of 458 students 
with disabilities in 11 public high schools in two States. Data were collected concerning 
the number of students with disabilities that received services, the type of coursework 
taken, the extent to which students received services in integrated settings, and the 
extent to which they received services comparable to those of students without 
disabilities. In this phase, AMS identified and documented promising strategies for 
serving secondary students with disabilities. Strategies were grouped into the following 
topics: personnel utilization, special education curriculum development, internal special 
education strategies, regular education teacher preparation /support, special education 
student preparation /support, and vocational options.

THE ABILITIES PROJECT: 
DEVELOPING DESCRIPTORS FOR CHARACTERIZING 
INFANTS AND PRESCHOOLERS WITH DISABILITIES 



North Carolina Department of Human Resources, FY 1990 



The ABILITIES project was a cooperative effort between the North Carolina Department 
of Human Resources, Developmental Disabilities Section, and the Frank Porter Graham 
Child Development Center of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The 
purpose of the project was to investigate the utility of the ABILITIES Index, an 
alternative instrument for describing the functional abilities and limitations of young 
children with disabilities, independent of etiologic bases and/or manifestations of 
handicapping conditions. The project consisted of five related studies to examine the 
reliability, utility, and consumer perceptions of the instrument for use in early 
intervention. 



Reliability Study 

This study examined the extent to which parents and various professionals consistently 
rated children with the ABILITIES Index. The two central questions addressed the 
extent to which ABILITIES ratings are consistent across raters, and for an individual 
rater, how consistent they are across time. The sample included 254 children, 213 
parents, 133 teachers, and 135 specialists (i.e., speech and language pathologist*, 
physical therapists, occupational therapists, and psychologists). There were no 
significant differences in percent of agreement for any of the three combinations (i.e., 
parents-teachers, teachers-therapists, and parents-therapists); raters who varied 
considerably in expertise, discipline, and relationship to the child generally agreed as 
to the child's presenting characteristics. Ratings appear to be stable over a short period 
(i.e., five weeks), and for most domains, also over a long period. While the Index 
overall provides a highly reliable "picture" of the child, caution should be exercised in 
using individual item rankings for research or diagnostic purposes. 



Team Consensus Study 

The Team Consensus Study more fully examined the reliability of the ABILITIES Index 
among a group of experts from different disciplines. Two questions were addressed: 
1) Do members of an interdisciplinary assessment team rate air same child in the same 
way? and 2) What is the relationship between individual team member ratings and a 
team consensus rating? A sample of 72 professionals from nine developmental 
evaluation centers participated. Respondents rated each child individually and then 
discussed the ratings at the child's staffing to develop a consensus rating. Perhaps due 
to the heterogeneous background of the raters or the limited time spent with the child, 
interrater reliability was found to be lower in this study than in the Reliability Study. 



ERLC 



602 

16th Annual Report To Congress: Appendix D D-l 



With regard to the second question, it was hypothesized that the ratings of individuals 
with expertise in a particular domain would more closely correspond to the team 
consensus rating than would the ratings of nonexperts. Mean ratings for several expert 
groups (medical professionals, occupational therapists, physical therapists, 
psychologists, and speech-language therapists) bore out the hypothesis, suggesting that, 
in coming to consensus, team members may "follow the lead" of the member perceived 
to have the greatest expertise in a given domain. 



Criterion Study 

To establish the validity of the ABILITIES Index, this study sought to determine the 
extent to which ratings on the ABILITIES Index could account for variability in 
developmental markers, intervention variables (mainstreamed versus self-contained 
placements) and traditional categorical labels (e.g, developmentally delayod). Two 
questions were addressed: 1) What is the relationship between functional 
characteristics, as measured by the ABILITIES Index, and developmental markers, 
assessed by the Battelle Developmental Inventory? and 2) To what extent can the 
ABILITIES Index complement or extend the differentiation of children grouped on the 
basis of traditional descriptors such as categorical labels or etiological markers? A total 
of 69 children from self-contained programs and 93 children from mainstreamed 
programs participated in the Time 1 testing; 50 children from self-contained settings 
and 23 children from mainstreamed settings were tested the second time. Correlations 
between ABILITIES domain scores and relevant BDI scores ranged from .53 to .73. 
Graphs based on aggregate ABILITIES ratings clearly differentiate children by 
intervention groups and by traditional categorical labels in terms of functional 
characteristics. These findings suggest that the ABILITIES Index is valid insofar as its 
ratings correspond to those of other systems of characterizing children. A third 
question was posed (i.e., Are functional characteristics of infants and preschoolers with 
disabilities associated with mainstreamed success?) but the nonrandom assignment of 
children to mainstreamed and self-contained groups, the small number of 
mainstreamed children who could be evaluated the second time, and the change in 
program status experienced by many of the children made it impossible to examine 
"mainstreamed success." 



Consumer Validation Study 

This study was conducted to determine the extent to which consumers perceive the 
ABILITIES Index to be understandable, acceptable, and useful. Two surveys were 
developed, one for parents and early intervention service providers (i.e., teachers, 
therapists, and DEC diagnostic specialists), and one for State agency representatives. 
A total of 209 parents, 91 teachers, 93 therapists, 55 diagnostic experts, and 71 state 
agency representatives participated. Mean ratings for all groups were positive, but 
there were statistically significant differences between groups, with parents consistently 
rating the index more positively. Parents 7 positive responses may indicate that the 



O'OJ 

O D " 2 16th Annual Report To Congress: Appendix D 

ERIC 



Index will be particularly helpful as a way to involve families more meaningfully in the 
assessment process. 



Descriptive Study 

The purpose of this study was to use the index to describe all the children in a given 
service delivery system. The ABILITIES Index was used to describe two populations 
of infants and toddlers served in early intervention programs. ABILITIES Indexes and 
demographic information were collected for all children (n=323) in North Carolina's 
CASSP evaluation study programs and for a sample of children (n=379) served by 
Louisiana's part H programs. ABILITIES data were aggregated and graphed to present 
a visual representation of the functional needs of each population. Such population 
profiles could be useful to facilitate state and local program planning. Additionally, 
samples of children with hearing (n= 46) and physical disabilities (n=83) from the 
People's Republic of China were described using the Index, indicating potential for 
extending the use of the Index to the international level. 



Conclusions 

The ABILITIES project consisted of a series of five related studies. The ABILITIES 
Index was found to be a reliable, valid, useful, and acceptable way to describe the 
functional needs of children with disabilities. At a systems or population level, 
aggregate ratings on the ABILITIES Index can be used to describe populations in such 
a way that groups with different characteristics can be clearly differentiated from one 
another based on functional characteristics. Findings from this project also suggest that 
a system such as the ABILITIES Index could be used at the individual level as an 
alternative to categorical labeling.

DETERMINING THE UTILITY OF USING SPECIAL EDUCATION 
STUDENT OUTCOME PROFILES TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS 
AND IMPACT OF SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES 

New Hampshire State Department of Education, FY 1992 



The Bureau for Special Education Services of the New Hampshire Department of 
Education conducted this feasibility study designed to determine the utility of special 
education student outcome profiles for evaluating the effectiveness and impact of 
special education services. The feasibility study examined how methodology and data 
profiles provided through a computerized school-based Student Outcome Information 
System (SOIS) could be used by local educators to systematically monitor the outcomes 
of students with disabilities and to evaluate the effectiveness of programs and services 
for these students. 

The study objectives were: 

1. To conduct pilot studies in two high schools and five 
elementary schools to determine how T special education student 
outcome profiles can be used to evaluate the effectiveness and 
impact of special education services. 

2. To identify the types of decisions that can be made to improve 
programs and services for students through the use of special 
education student outcome profiles. 

From a methodological perspective, this feasibility study was designed to determine: 
1) the types of variables that both special and regular education administrators felt were 
important in evaluating programs and services for students with disabilities; 2) data 
availability and accessibility for these variables; 3) the extent to which data for selected 
variables could be effectively imported from schools' administrative software; and, 4) 
how information in data profiles can be used by special and regular education staff for 
monitoring student performance and evaluating program effectiveness. 

Through a structured process conducted by the study team, the special and regular 
education staff at each site achieved consensus on the variables they felt would allow 
them to monitor student performance and evaluate program effectiveness. Bringing the 
special and regular educators together to achieve consensus on the study variables was 
an essential element of creating understanding and ownership of a process that 
focussed on evaluation capacity at the local level. The meetings resulted in agreement 
on outcome variables (e.g., attendance rates, discipline/suspension rates, drop-out rates 
etc.), student variables (e.g., gender, grade level, family structure, disability etc.) and 
educational /process variables (e.g., regular education, special education, previously 
retained, reading level, math level etc.).

ERIC 



D"4 16th Annual Report To Congress: Appendix D 



The feasibility study included the total population of special and regular education 
students from the five elementary schools. At the high school level, data were collected 
for two grade levels selected by the administrators. Data was collected on 2,373 
students at the elementary level of which 196 were students with disabilities and data 
was collected on 2,617 students at the high school level of which 256 were students 
with disabilities. The data was collected from school records and New Hampshire's 
Special Education Information System (SPEDIS). 

The SOIS provides almost unlimited capability to disaggregate data and depict 
outcomes by pertinent student and process variables. An array of SOIS profiles was 
generated through the feasibility study in order to determine their utility for monitoring 
student performance and examining program effectiveness in each of the participating 
schools. The types of profiles generated through the feasibility study included the 
following: 

• Population Profiles. The population profiles depict the 
percentages of students in the school population that reflect the 
pertinent student and educational process variables. A 
population profile can be generated for any of the population 
sub-groups and depicts the specific characteristics of this 
population by all of the variables of interest. 

• Absence Profile. The absence profile depicts absence rates by 
pertinent variables, and can be generated for any group (e.g., 
total school or by special education). 

• Disciplinary Incidents Profile. This profile depicts the 
discipline rates of the population groups. For each population 
group, the number and percent of students involved in at least 
one disciplinary action or several disciplinary actions are 
depicted. 

• Grade Performance and Grade Distribution Profiles. There 
are three types of grade profiles. Grade Performance Profiles 
depict the number and percent of students receiving 2 or more 
A's (i.e., experiencing positive progress in school) across their 
subject areas and the number and percent of students receiving 
2 or more D's/F's (ie v where grades suggest they are at risk 
of school failure) across their subject areas. Subject Area Grade 
Distribution Profiles depic grade distributions for designated 
populations by subject area, such as mathematics and show the 
proportion of grades received by the student sub-groups that 
were above satisfactory (A or B), satisfactory (C), or below 
satisfactory (D or F). Course Grade Distribution Profiles are 
generated for a single specific population and depict the 
proportion of students in that population enrolled in specific 
courses and the distribution of grades for each course.

q 16m Annual Report To Congress: Appendix D D"5 

ERIC 



• Dropout Rate Profile. The dropout rate profile depicts the 

percentage of students in each population group who dropped 
out and didn't return to school, as well as the students who 
dropped out and then re-entered. 

For most of the variables, the feasibility study indicated that data were available and 
could be accessed efficiently from manual school records or administrative software. 
However, across the schools, the efficiency of accessing data varies according to the 
extent to which the school had instituted an integrated recordkeeping system, with 
most data computerized or easily located in a central location. The two high schools 
were far more advanced in this regard than the elementary schools. 

Determining the utility of the profiles involved a focus on the extent to which the 
disaggregated data depicted in the profiles: 1) enabled local district staff to determine 
the extent to which students with disabilities and subgroups of this population were 
achieving satisfactory outcomes as compared to their peers; 2) enabled staff to identify 
variables which appeared to have either a positive or negative influence on student 
outcomes; and 3) addressed their evaluation questions. 

The feasibility study contributed to a shared understanding among the participating 
special and regular education administrators of the combination of factors that must be 
considered in planning inclusive services for students with disabilities and in evaluating 
their effectiveness. The use of the SOIS to generate the profiles empowers local 
educators to identify program evaluation questions that are meaningful to them and to 
acquire the data that addresses these questions.

Abstract: 

Monitoring of IEPs has resulted in increased compliance with State and Federal 
regulations. Compliance with procedural regulations, however, does not assure that 
students achieve short-term goals and objectives or long-term valued outcomes. 
Moreover, the relationship among IEP content, children's needs and classroom 
instruction is unclear. If IEPs are to become tools of outcome assessment and 
accountability, they need to direct activities other than compliance with procedural 
regulations; that is, they should guide instruction and result in students' achievement 
of valued outcomes. The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of 
establishing a relationship among State and nationally identified outcome measures and 
IEPs so that IEPs may be used to direct student achievement of valued outcomes. 

To redirect how IEPs are used will necessitate that IEPs have objectives related to 
valued outcomes and that measures of student achievement of these valued outcomes 
exist. The Performance Assessment for Self-Sufficiency (PASS) was developed by the 
American Institutes for Research for the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) 
to assess the functional skills and behaviors of students with disabilities who are exiting 
the educational system. An expert system is under development that will predict the 
services these students will need after they leave school. PASS may be useful to assess 
educational outcomes for students with disabilities if the outcomes measured 
correspond to valued outcomes at the national, State, or local level. The National 
Center for Educational Outcomes (NCEO), another OSEP sponsored project, has 
developed a model of educational outcomes for students with disabilities that specifies 
enabling outcomes (presence /participation; accommodation/adaptation/ compensation) 
and educational outcomes (literacy, satisfaction, contribution/citizenship, 
physical /mental health, independence /responsibility, and social /behavioral skills). 

Kentucky developed a set of valued outcomes under the Kentucky Education Reform 
Act (KERA); student IEPs are to address these outcomes. Delaware does not have a set 
of valued outcomes but rather a system for collecting data on special education 
outcomes, the Special Education Effectiveness Development System (SEEDS). 

(jo) 



16m Annual Report To Congress: Appendix E 




Three major questions will be addressed: 



1. 



Is it feasible to establish a correspondence among the NCEO model, 
the PASS instrument, and outcome measures commonly used in 
Delaware and Kentucky? 



2. 



Is it feasible to obtain PASS data from existing student records, 
namely IEPs? 



3. 



Is it feasible to link IEP components, student demographics, 
and PASS items to State and national outcomes? 



Both States will involve stakeholders in crosswalking the NCEO outcomes, the State 
outcomes /measures, and the PASS instrument; the stakeholders will also be involved 
in assessing the relationship between IEPs and the dimensions resulting from the 
crosswalking of the national and State outcomes and the PASS instrument. Teachers 
will be trained in using Project PASS. IEPs developed after the training will be 
assessed to determine the feasibility of linking IEPs to outcomes.

Project Period: January 1, 1993 to October 31, 1993 
Abstract: 

The first goal of America 2000 is that all children should start school ready to learn. 
This study seeks to address this goal by determining the feasibility of examining 
educational outcomes for children served with Part H funds. More particularly, it will 
assess the feasibility of evaluating the effectiveness of services provided to three groups 
of young Hawaiian children-those who are developmentally delayed, biologically at 
risk, and environmentally at risk-after they leave the Part H programs and before they 
enter school. 

For comparative purposes, Hawaii is a particularly interesting State for a Part H study 
because it has the most inclusive definition of environmental risk of any State, and 
offers a broad array of services for environmentally at-risk children, who constitute the 
great majority of Part H eligible children in the State. Hawaii also maintains a 
computerized tracking system which follows children through early intervention and 
records transition and referral information. 

This study will begin to address the question of what happens to children who age out 
of Part H. Of 59,000 children in Hawaii age zero to three, 2,800 are served under 
Part H. Twenty-two percent of children exiting Part H programs are referred to Part B 
programs. How many of these actually enroll in Part B is currently unknown, while 
even less information exists about receipt of services by, and educational and 
developmental outcomes for, the remaining 78 percent. However, determining how 
best to follow these children after they leave Part H requires more information than is 
presently available to the State concerning which data already exist, and in what form, 
across agency recordkeeping systems. 

The goals of this feasibility study are to: 

1. Determine, for each of the three Part H populations, the best 

way to follow children after they leave Part H;

2. 



Estimate the feasibility and costs of identifying services and 
developmental and /or educational outcomes for children after 
they exit Part H programs; 



3. Estimate the expense of measuring developmental outcomes if 
these are not available; 

4. Assess the possible barriers to the full evaluation project, 
design ways to minimize them, and estimate the probability of 
success in obtaining needed information for the evaluation; and 

5. Develop the design for a full evaluation if adequate information has been 
generated. 

The following activities will be conducted: literature and multi-agency records review; 
facilitation of interagency collaboration; devising a strategy to measure outcomes; 
developing a data collection and analysis plan; and conducting a pilot study.

"Kids in the Middle: A Study of the Status of Children Aged 11-15, Diagnosed as 
Seriously Emotionally Disturbed" 

Project Director: Susan D. Mackey-Andrews 

Cost: Federal Share = $127,524 
Agency Share = $115,347 
Tct*I = $242,871 

Project Period: January 1, 1993 to December 31, 1994 
Abstract: 

Pressures to reform the nation's schools embodied in initiatives such as the National 
Education Goals, combined with provisions for greater inclusion of students with 
disabilities in regular educational settings contained in such measures as the Americans 
with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA), has 
focused particular attention on students diagnosed with seriously emotional disturbance 
(SED). Nationally, during the 1989-90 school year, 52 percent of children reported with 
SED were concentrated in the 11-15 year old age group. Although even more likely 
than their peers with other disabilities to drop out of school, these adolescents can be 
as much as 10 times more expensive to educate than the average student. As a group, 
they were also more likely to be affected by poverty and neglect, adolescent pregnancy 
and drug use, and to be involved with the juvenile justice system. 

The Maine Department of Education, in collaboration with the University of Maine at 
Orono, will conduct a study aimed at better understanding this key population. The 
proposed study will address the following questions about the State's student 
population of middle school age with serious emotional disturbance, between 11 and 
15 years old: 

1. What the characteristics of students with SED in Maine in 
terms of: age at identification, gender, years in special 
education, educational placement, exit status, rate of GED 
receipt, reclassification to /from another disability, 
socioeconomic status, and district of residence? 

2. What are the factors associated with varying identification rates 
for SED in Maine? 

a. Are eligibility criteria for SED being applied 
uniformly in the State. If not, do criteria 
correlate with the rate of SED identification? 



61 4 

O 16th Annual Report To Congress: Appendix E E"5 

ERIC 



b. Does the availability of specialized diagnostic or 
treatment resources correlate with the rate of 
identification of SED? 

c. What are the characteristics of the middle school 
model and to what extent does the presence of 
middle school features correlate with the rate of 
identification for SED? 

d. To what extent is the use of student assistance 
teams (SATs) correlated with the rate of 
identification of SED students? 

e. To what extent does district poverty correlate 
with the SED identification rate? 

3. Among those factors associated with varying identification 
rates of SED, which are seen by local staff as most critical, and 
why? 

4. How do schools /districts differentiate behaviors associated 
with emerging development from deviational behaviors 
associated with SED? 

5. What needs, met or unmet, do parents of children 11-15 with 
SED have, in relation to the identification and special education 
process? 

To answer these questions, a literature review will be performed, existing data will be 
obtained from the Maine Department of Education and from student records, and 
selected interviews will be conducted. Student specific information for students with 
SED served through Part B, IDEA, and Chapter 1 will be collected on age, placement 
(residential treatment facilities or similar special facilities) and exit status.

"Services for Outcomes and Performance Assessment for Disabled Students" 
Project Director: John Haigh 

Cost: Federal Share = $167,923 
Agency Share - $ 61346 
Total = $229,269 

Project Period: October 1, 1992 to September 30, 1994 
Abstract: 

America 2000 focused the nation's attention on the need to change our approach to 
education. Six goals and four strategies were identified to improve the quality of 
education, including the need to better evaluate student progress. In response to this, 
the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) and the University of Maryland 
will conduct a study to identify educational outcomes and develop assessment devices 
for Maryland students with disabilities who have been exempt from the types of 
assessments given to students in general education. 

The study's twin goals are to identify a viable set of educational outcomes for these 
students and to develop standards and procedures which the State can use to measure 
the effectiveness of the special education programs. The study will address the 
following questions: 

1. What are the desired educational outcomes for the target 
students, who, due to their educational program, are exempted 
from the Maryland School Performance Assessment Program? 

2. What are the indicators of those outcomes and how can they 
be validly and reliably measured at different points in time to 
draw comparisons and judgements about programs? 

3. What resources and procedures are needed to support 
implementation of the assessment system by LEAs? 

The assessment strategy will be dynamic and address an array of student performance 
attributes. To ensure that the resulting strategy is reliable, valid, and efficient, a task 
force comprising master teachers from urban, suburban, and rural schools, along with 
project personnel from the University of Maryland and MSDE, will provide input.

"Determining the Utility of Using Special Education Student Outcome Profiles to 
Evaluate the Effectiveness and Impact of Special Education Services" 

Project Director: Jane Weissmann 

Cost: Federal Share = $49,858 
A gency Share = $32,223 
Total = $82,081 

Project Period: October 1, 1992 to September 30, 1993 
Abstract: 

Since the passage of the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA) and the America 2000 
initiatives, there has been a growing awareness of the need for State and local education 
agencies to demonstrate the effectiveness of their educational programs. Few States, 
though, have developed the ability to track, use, and report student outcomes. Over 
the past year, New Hampshire and the Center for Resource Management have 
developed a data base containing most of the information necessary to monitor student 
progress. The goal of this current project is to study the viability of using this data 
base to monitor the performance of special education students. 

The project's objectives are to: 

• conduct pilot studies in two high schools and four elementary 
schools to determine how special education student outcome 
profiles can be used to evaluate the effectiveness and impact of 
special education services; and 

• identify the types of decisions that can be made to improve 
programs and services for students through the use of special 
edi nation student outcome profiles. 

The database includes outcomes drawn from the literature and considered important 
in measuring a program's overall effectiveness, including: attendance rates, 
discipline /suspension rates, course participation, extracurricular participation, criterion- 
referenced measures, grades or other indicators of mastery in courses/core learning 
areas, test scores, personal development assessment results, and drop-out rates. These 
data formed the basis of a profile for each special education student by grade level, 
gender, disability, program placement, hours of service per week, related service, 
previous school attended, prior retention, participation in early intervention programs, 
and other nonspecial education programs.

"An Evaluation of Family-Centered Coordinated Part H Services in North Carolina" 
Project Director: Pat Vandiviere 

Cost: Federal Share = $21? 247 
Agency Share - $145,644 
Total = $358,891 

Project Period: October 1, 1992 to September 30, 1994 

Abstract: 

Part H of the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA) requires that all intervention 
services provided to at-risk infants and toddlers be family-centered and coordinated 
across disciplines and agencies. North Carolina, as part of its continued support for 
and participation in Part H of IDEA, is attempting to revise its early intervention 
services to better reflect these two elements of the Act. 

The overarching goal of this study is to assess the implementation of the revised service 
delivery system in the State, in particular, with respect to family-centered services and 
the quality of local interagency coordination. 

Data will be collected from parents and service providers using questionnaires, 
individual interviews, focus groups and analysis of Individualized Family Service Plans 
(IFSPs) and local interagency agreements. The study will: 

1. describe the status of the implementation of family-centered 
service coordination; 

2. identify enablers and barriers to family-centered and 
coordinated service delivery; 

3. improve policies and practices; and 

4. develop new instruments and utilize existing instruments for 
the purpose of statewide evaluation. 

The information gained will be used to supplement the various program evaluation 
efforts currently underway in the State and to provide information to parents, service 
providers, policy makers, and preservice and in-service trainers. Changes in policy will 
result if the results of the evaluation indicate a need for change.

Agency Share = $22,900 
Total = $72,900 

Project Period: September 1, 1992 to August 31, 1993 
Abstract: 

Since the passage of the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA) and the America 2000 
initiatives, there has been a growing awareness of the need to take a serious look at the 
quality of education and to justify the high cost of special education. Professional 
educators, parents, and policy makers have become dissatisfied with the practice of 
documenting inputs, processes, and compliance, and are increasingly interested in 
demonstrating program effectiveness by showing that students are learning. 

This feasibility study is the first phase of a multi-phase study to develop a 
comprehensive evaluation system for programs for children with disabilities in North 
Carolina. The goal of the study will be to develop a conceptual framework and study 
design. 

Tasks to be undertaken during the study will include: 



1. conducting a comprehensive literature review; 

2. developing a conceptual framework; 

3. generating study questions; 

4. developing a design and a list of participants and procedures; 

5. developing analytic procedures; 

6. facilitating an expert review of the conceptual framework; and 

7. conducting a pilot study. 



The results of the study are intended to provide the basis for a future proposal to 
conduct a full-blown evaluation that will aim to establish an effective statewide 
evaluation system for all public schools in North Carolina.

"Evaluation of the Oregon Supported Education Plan and Local Systems Change" 
Project Director: Patricia Jackson 

Cost: Federal Share = $176,471 
Agency Share = $ 86399 
Total = $262,870 

Project Period: October 1, 1992 to September 30, 1994 
Abstract: 

This study will assess the impact of State and local educational reform policies and 
practices on the outcomes of special education restructuring initiatives for Supported 
Education. The Oregon Department of Education's (ODE) 1990 comprehensive 
education plan, which called on LEAs to support inclusion of students with IEPs in 
regular school settings, also required the Department to evaluate the effects of inclusion 
on instruction and learning. While this plan was being implemented, the State's 
politicians and educators were making other reforms in the educational system. 
However, no evaluation component was included to monitor the impact of these 
various reforms on the State's special education students. This study is designed to fill 
this void by evaluating the effect of these restructuring reforms and their impact on 
inclusion of all students in regular education settings. 

The study's conceptual framework and technical design will be based on one developed 
during an earlier feasibility study. For this study, 25-30 teams of school personnel 
representing a cross-section of those Oregon school districts which were involved in the 
1990-1993 ODE Comprehensive Plan will receive surveys. These teams will be trained 
by ODE to provide Supported Education to students with IEPs in regular education. 
In addition, 14 of the teams will also be interviewed and observed. 

The goals of the study are to: 

modify the 1991-92 feasibility study's conceptual framework, 
evaluation design, and measurement instruments, as needed, 
for the full evaluation study; 

describe and analyze the impact and effectiveness of the ODE 
Comprehensive Plan on LEA policy, ODE activities, level of 
supported education, teacher instruction, and student 
outcomes;

3. analyze the LEA data to identify barriers to supported 
education and strategies to overcome these barriers, and 
determine the effects of implementing Supported Education 
over time; and 

4. produce a report of the impact of the ODE Supported 
Education Goals on the LEA teams and, their students. 

This evaluation will use a participant-oriented design employing, observation, 
interviews, and survey methods to provide feedback to the ODE on the 30 LEAs.

"The Oregon NTE Feasibility Study" 
Project Director: Karen Brazeau 

Cost: Federal Share = $79,587 
Agency Share = $72,578 
Total = $152,165 

Project Period: October 1, 1992 to September 30, 1993 

Abstract: 

Oregon, like many other States, is caught in a dilemma. On the one hand, it faces a 
potential teacher shortage by the year 2000, when it is projected that 60 percent of its 
teachers will retire. On the other, it must ensure that an adequate supply of qualified 
general and special education teachers will be available and that student performance 
will improve by the end of the decade. Currently, there are two endorsements for 
special education teachers in Oregon. One is for severely handicapped learners and 
enables teachers to teach severely handicapped students only. The other endorsement, 
for handicapped learners, allows them to teach all students with Individual Education 
Program (IEPs). 

The Oregon Teachers Standards and Practices Commission (TSPC) is attempting to 
assure the supply of special education teachers by increasing the available pool by 
offering the handicapped learner special education endorsement to any general 
education teacher holding a valid Oregon teaching certificate who has passed the 
special education subtests of the National Teachers Examination (NTE). Since this is 
a nontraditional certification process, the State is interested in its effectiveness. 

The goals of this feasibility study are to collect a preliminary set of data to inform the 
State on this issue and to design a full-blown study to assess the effectiveness of these 
uniquely certified teachers. 

To achieve the goals the study will: 

1. gather demographics data; 

2. conduct surveys; and 

3. develop an appropriate research design. 

The study will review existing data, identify additional data needs, design appropriate 
and effective ways to gather additional information, formulate research questions, and 
pilot test designs which may be useful in making policy decisions.

"A Feasibility Study for a State Evaluation of the Degree of Implementation and 
Effectiveness of Three Service Configurations, General /Special Education" 

Project Director Lois Adams 

Cost: Federal Share = $ 75,245 
Agency Share - $ 37,341 
Total = $112,586 

Project Period: January 1, 1994 - December 31, 1994 
Abstract: 

The major purpose of this project is to determine the feasibility of developing a 
conceptual framework that can be used effectively to examine three configurations of 
special education services. At present, most special education services are organized 
around a continuum of services from least to most restrictive placement. Each level of 
the continuum has a unique set of roles and responsibilities that are shared between the 
special and general educators. The conceptual framework developed for the feasibility 
study will focus on teacher roles and responsibilities, curriculum, instructional methods, 
and environmental components (e.g., student-student interaction, classroom climate, 
time-on-task etc.) in three instructional settings (i.e., services in general education 
classes with special education consultation, services in co-taught classes, and services 
in resource classes). The framework will attempt to identify the critical attributes that 
allow individualization of instruction for students with learning disabilities, mild 
mental retardation, or emotional disturbance while maintaining the instructional flow. 

Once the conceptual framework has been developed, instruments will be developed 
that will differentiate the instructional practices for students with special needs among 
the three instructional configurations. A small scale pilot study will be conducted in 
at least one school to provide initial data and insight into the clarity and utility of the 
instruments. 

The results of this feasibility study will provide: 1) a refined or revised framework for 
a more in-depth fullscale evaluation of the quality of service provided to special 
education students; and 2) instrumentation to compare and contrast service delivery 
modes for students with mild to moderate disabilities. The instruments, once 
appropriately revised in light of the feasibility study, are also likely to become part of 
a future state evaluation to investigate the "opportunities to learn" and related benefits 
of special education support within the regular education environment.

"Feasibility Study: Social Competence Outcomes and Indicators of Progress for 
Students with SED" 

Project Director: Kay Cessna 

Cost: Federal Share = $49,893 
Agency Share = $32,014 
Total = $81,907 

Project Period: January 1, 1994 - December 31, 1994 
Abstract: 

The purpose of this feasibility study, to be conducted by the Colorado Department of 
Education, is to develop a model for measuring social competence and to determine the 
feasibility of constructing a measurement system to evaluate progress toward social 
competence for students identified as seriously emotionally disturbed. The model for 
measuring social competence will be based on the concept that the motivation of the 
student and the context of the social task interact to produce a set of probable behaviors 
with varying degrees of social value. 

In previous evaluation studies, the Colorado Department of Education has attempted 
to determine the level of program implementation that students with severe emotional 
disturbance were receiving in Colorado. The data collected on programs have provided 
a picture of the resources, practices, and instruction that are currently used with 
seriously emotionally disturbed students. Efforts have been made to connect those data 
with information about the effects of the programs, i.e., the outcomes of the learners. 
This has been a great challenge, since the tools available to collect student outcome data 
related to the social, emotional, and behavioral IEP goals that apply to seriously 
emotionally disturbed students have not been adequate. The availability of 
measurement models and tools in the area of social competence would greatly enhance 
the ability to evaluate student progress and, ultimately, program effectiveness. 

The proposed study consists of the following major activities: 1) development of a 
model for measuring social competence; 2) development of items which incorporate the 
interactive relationship of the identified specific social intents of students and the 
requirements of the social context; and 3) determination of the feasibility of constructing 
an instrument to measure progress toward social competence utilizing these items. 

The development of social competence outcomes and a system to measure them as 
proposed by this project would be important in assisting the Colorado Department of 
Education and other state and local education agencies involved in school restructuring.

Agency Share - $ 51,684 
Total = $100,702 

Project Period: January 1, 1994 to June 30, 1995 
Abstract: 

This study will be performed by the District of Columbia State Office of Special 
Education in collaboration with the Department of Psychoeducational Studies at 
Howard University and the National Center on Educational Outcomes (NCEO) at the 
University of Minnesota. The purpose of the study is to examine the feasibility of using 
the NCEO conceptual model of educational outcomes and indicators to develop 
outcome measures for special needs students in the District of Columbia public schools. 
Consideration will also be given, throughout this feasibility study, to opportunities for 
measuring outcomes for the entire student population in the District of Columbia public 
schools and for comparing data with results obtained in other states. 

Involvement of NCEO in this study is a key factor; NCEO has already initiated work 
with state and federal agencies to enhance and expand data collection on students with 
disabilities. One result of NCEO's work is the development of a model of outcomes 
and indicators for disabled students. Field testing of this model is planned, and the 
District of Columbia public schools will serve, through the current study, as a test site 
for implementation of the NCEO model. 

The current feasibility study in the District of Columbia will involve an Advisory 
Council and a series of stakeholder meetings, and will include the following tasks: 

• a literature search regarding outcomes and indicators; 

• a review of the particular outcomes and indicators appearing 
in the NCEO model; 

• development and administration of a questionnaire to identify 
potential problems in evaluating special education programs in 
the District of Columbia; 

• collection of data on students from teachers; and

Project Director: Jean Johnson 

Cost: Federal Share = $50,000 
A gency Share = $33,333 
Total = $83,333 

Project Period: January 1, 1994 to September 30, 1994 
Abstract: 

The Hawaii Department of Health Zero to Three Project, in collaboration with the 
Hawaii University Affiliated Program, will conduct a feasibility study to determine the 
best ways to identify needs of families involved in early intervention programs under 
Part H of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The study will also 
evaluate the relative merits of different ways of tracking how well these needs are 
being addressed through the existing system of early intervention services. Research 
currently underway, also funded through the State Agency /Federal Evaluation Studies 
(SAFES) Program, has demonstrated that Individual Family Service Plans (IFSPs) do not 
adequately document family needs or specific responses to these needs. If a planned 
full-scale evaluation of Part H outcomes is to be successful, it will require better 
definition and specification of these family level variables, as well as alternative sources 
of data for them. The present feasibility study is designed to lay one part of the 
groundwork for this future evaluation effort. 

The importance of evaluating family outcomes under Part H is underscored by the shift 
in emphasis from individual-centered to family-focused approaches to early 
intervention. Although Hawaii has moved rapidly to train program staff and 
encourage programs to incorporate a family focus, as well as cultural competence, into 
their practice, little is known about how this process is working. Moreover, with three 
different populations of children being served (delayed, biologically at-risk and 
environmentally at-risk) and a variety of service models in use, it will be critical to 
examine differential impacts by service model for different populations and 
racial /ethnic groups. 

The goals of the feasibility study are: 1) to create operational definitions of family 
culture, family needs, program responses and the extent to which needs are being met; 
2) to determine the best way to document these variables; 3) to determine the feasibility 
and estimate the expense of acquiring information on these variables from current 
Part H programs and /or families and also of acquiring this information for families 
who have exited Part H; 4) to identify methods of analysis that will maximize the 
validity and usefulness of the results.

Project Period: October 1, 1993 to May 30, 1994 
Abstract: 

This feasibility study is being conducted by the Kansas State Board of Education in 
conjunction with the Center for Educational Testing and Evaluation (CETE) at the 
University of Kansas. The overall purpose of the study is to determine the feasibility 
and validity of using existing statewide student assessment procedures and practices 
to test students with disabilities. While current legislation calls for inclusion of disabled 
students in the statewide testing program, implementation guidelines for the program 
permit local discretion in determining the particular students with disabilities who are 
actually tested. 

Recent test data indicate that students with disabilities are underrepresented (and 
possibly not covered at all) in the statewide testing initiative. The goal of the current 
study is to explore the reasons for this, determine the extent to which students with 
disabilities and the programs provided to them could benefit from the state testing 
program, and to recommend any necessary modifications so that the testing program 
can be effective for students with disabilities as well as for all students. 

Three basic questions will be explored through this feasibility study: 

• Could the current state-mandated assessment system 
potentially produce useful and valid program information 
regarding students with disabilities and the services they 
receive? 

• If the current system is determined to be valid for assessment 
of students with disabilities, what modifications to system 
policies and practices should be recommended to produce 
maximum benefit for students with disabilities and the 
associated education programs and services?

positive /negative impacts of various factors. 

The study will build upon a previous feasibility study that resulted in the identification 
of variables important to the present evaluation and yielded information as to the 
accessibility of those variables particularly at the local school level. The feasibility 
study allowed the researchers to select variables for the current study, develop the 
range of questions to be addressed, and decide how data will be profiled in the current 
study. 

The current study will be conducted in five New Hampshire high schools. Data will 
be collected, at the end of the 1993-1994 school year, on approximately 700 students 
with disabilities in regular school placements and about 4,500 regular education 
students. This will allow comparisons of the extent to which outcomes of high school 
students with disabilities in regular education placements are comparable to outcomes 
of their peers without disabilities. The data will include: student variables 
(socioeconomic measures and time spent in certain activities) obtained through the 
schools' administrative software, New Hampshire's Special Education Information 
System (SPEDIS), and a student survey; educational process variables (course of study, 
placements, services, etc.) gathered through the schools' administrative software, 
SPEDIS, Chapter 1 program rosters, students' cumulative records, and codes requested 
from special education administrators; and outcome variables (grades, attendance, 
dropout status, etc.) obtained through the schools' administrative software. Analysis

NORTH CAROLINA STATE DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES 



"An Evaluation of the Impact of North Carolina's Early Childhood Initiative on the 
Inclusion of Preschoolers with Disabilities and Their Families" 

Project Director: Patricia Porter 

Cost: Federal Share = $ 99,146 
Agency Share = $ 56,833 
Total = $155,979 

Project Period: January 1, 1994 to December 30, 1995 
Abstract: 

North Carolina has implemented a comprehensive early childhood program called 
Smart Start. Major components of the program include: 1) improving standards and 
incentives for early childhood programs across the state and making these programs 
more affordable for families; 2) creating a nonprofit public-private partnership to devise 
a plan for providing better early childhood education; and 3) establishing local 
partnerships which will consider the characteristics of individual communities in 
developing early childhood programs. 

While Smart Start is aimed at all children under 5 years of age, the present study will 
focus only on infants, toddlers, and preschoolers with disabilities, and their families, 
who receive early intervention services under Part H or Part B of IDEA. It is part of 
the effort to evaluate the overall initiative. The fundamental question addressed by the 
present study is: What happens to preschoolers with disabilities and their families as 
a function of community early childhood programs developed by the local partnerships 
(the third component of the state's initiative)? The inclusion of young children with 
disabilities and their families into the comprehensive system of services will be assessed 
using the following outcomes: 1) access to inclusive programming for young children 
with disabilities and their families; 2) the appropriateness and quality of child care 
arrangements for children with disabilities; 3) the involvement and coordination of 
agencies providing special services to these children and their families; and 4) family 
participation in community planning and satisfaction with general early childhood 
services. 

In 1S93, Smart Start was implemented in 12 pilot counties in the state. The inital 
counties were selected to represent the diversity within the state on variables such as 
size, resources, and geographic location. For this project, six of the counties will be 
selected as demonstration sites and the other six counties will serve as comparison sites, 
matched on several key variables.

Data collection will be linked to the overall evaluation of the program and will proceed 
on three levels— conducting a document review of local plans, documenting the 
implementation of the service plans, and assessing change on outcome variables over 
time. A variety of quantitative and qualitative assessment methods will be used 
including qualitative interviews, focus groups, rating scales, and questionnaires.

"Evaluating Ohio's Infant Hearing Screening and Assessment Program: 1990-1993" 



Project Director Cindy Oser 

Cost: Federal Share = $50,000 
Agency Share - $33,334 
Total = $83,334 



Project Period: October 1, 1993 to September 30, 1994 



Abstract: 



In February 1990, Ohio implemented the Infant Hearing Screening and Assessment 
Program (IHSAP) requiring hospitals to use a questionnaire to identify infants at risk 
for hearing loss. Hospitals must then either provide hearing assessments of all at-risk 
infants or give their parents a list of facilities performing these assessments. 

The Ohio Department of Health (ODH) wants eventually to conduct a full-scale 
evaluation of IHSAP that will answer the following questions: 

• Is IHSAP successful in identifying infants who are at risk for 
hearing impairment? 

• Is Ohio's early intervention system working to ensure that 
infants identified with hearing impairment are enrolled in 
services by the time they are twelve months of age? 

In the current project, Ohio is conducting a feasibility study to determine the best 
approach for conducting the full-scale study. The ^ Ability study will examine the 
relative merits of two approaches to the full study, rt ^pective and prospective. 

The tasks of the feasibility evaluation will be to: 1) decide which data would be needed 
to effectively evaluate IHSAP using both a retrospective and a prospective approach; 
2) determine whether these data are available/retrievable; 3) if it is determined that 
appropriate data can be obtained for either or both approaches, estimate the cost that 
would be involved and the time that would be required to perform either or both of 
these types of evaluations; 4) decide, in conjunction with ODH personnel, which 
method should be used. 

The final task of the feasibility study will be the preparation of a prospectus for the full 
evaluation study, including criteria for selection of subjects, data collection methods, 
and methods for analyzing and reporting data. The final version of this prospectus will 
reflect the input of various groups, including the IHSAP Subcommittee; the Ohio

to review completed activities, provide feedback, and discuss future plans. The 
feasibility final report will incorporate this prospectus, as well as a discussion of the 
data and criteria used in weighing whether to recommend a prospective or a

"A Feasibility Study to Identify and /or Develop a Process to Measure Direct Student 
Outcomes for Academic, Functional and Social Performance for Evaluation of the 
Oregon Supported Education Plan" 

Project Director Patricia Jackson 

Cost: Federal Share = $57,312 
Agency Share = $58,9 30 
Total = $116,242 

Project Period: October 1, 1993 to September 30, 1994 
Abstract: 

This feasibility study, conducted by the Oregon Department of Education in 
collaboration with Portland State University, is designed to build upon Oregon's still 
ongoing full evaluation study of the Oregon Department of Education's Comprehensive 
Program Plan for Supported Education. This full evaluation is using information from 
observations, interviews and surveys to identify attitudes and perceived outcomes for 
students with disabilities who receive special education and related services in regular 
education settings in a sample of 25 schools across Oregon. That study is also 
identifying perceived barriers to supported education and strategies to overcome such 
barriers. 

The purpose of the current feasibility study is to extend the full study beyond an 
examination only of attitudes and perceptions by exploring the feasibility of measuring 
direct student outcomes and comparing/contrasting the effects of supported education 
using outcome measures. The result of the feasibility study will be to specify a process 
for measuring direct student outcomes in academic, social, and functional performance, 
and to revise the framework/design of the full evaluation study. 

Through the feasibility study, information will be gathered from the 25 teams of local 
school district personnel who participated in the previous full evaluation study. These 
data will be used to assess the potential for measuring direct outcomes for students 
with disabilities participating in the state's inclusive education initiative. The outcome 
measures considered will include academic achievement, functional skills, social 
competence, attendance, grades, and assessment of classroom assignments. Also, 
consideration of the conceptual model developed by the National Center for 
Educational Outcomes will be incorporated into the planning process of the feasibility 
study.

Four goals have been established for the feasibility study. These are to: 



specify a process for measuring direct student outcomes for 
three groups — students with mild disabilities, severe 
disabilities, and behavioral disorders; 

extend the framework /desigu established in the Oregon

Agency Share = $ 77,634 



Total = $170,615 



Project Period: 



October 1, 1993 - September 30, 1995 



Abstract: 



The Oregon State Department of Education, in cooperation with the state licensing 
authority (Teachers Standards and Practices Commission) and Western Oregon State 
College's Teaching Research Division, will evaluate the effectiveness of the National 
Teacher Examination (NTE) as a vehicle to add special edur ition endorsements to the 
basic teaching certificate. Oregon has two endorsements, in addition to a regular 
teaching certificate, which are required to teach special education students: 
handicapped learner and severe handicappo- learner. The "severe" endorsement allows 
the teacher to teach only the severely handicapped students while the "handicapped 
learner" allows teaching in all special education programs. The "severe" endorsement 
cannot be earned through NTE testing. Thus, this study will focus only on the 
handicapped learner endorsement. The present study builds upon the results of a 
feasibility study conducted to identify a usable data base and to provide the foundation 
for a comprehensive evaluation effort. 

The present study will employ a three-pronged approach in which quantitative research 
methods, qualitative research methods, and an active advisory design group all 
contribute to the synthesis of multiple perspectives on traditional and alternative 
professional development for special educators. The quantitative approach will be used 
to explore relationships between teacher characteristics and performance. The 
qualitative case studies will contribute texture, depth, and theory development to the 
quantitative findings. The Advisory Design Group will assist in maintaining a 
pragmatic focus, formulating explanations and implications of findings and directing 
conclusions and recommendations toward an informed and comprehensive personnel 
development plan for Oregon. 

Thic evaluation study is important because of its implications for the recruitment and 
retention of qualified teachers in special education; the provision of quality educational 
services to students with disabilities in rural areas (feasibility study findings suggest 
that a large portion of teachers who enter special education through non-traditional 
paths work in rural parts of the state); and assessment of alternative methods of teacher 
training and preparation.

"Differential Characteristics and Effects of Family-Oriented Approaches to Early 
Intervention" 

Project Director: Jacqueline Epstein 

Cost: Federal Share = $79,519 
Agency Share = $53,217 
Total = $132,736 

Project Period: October 1, 1993 to September 30, 1995 

Abstract: 

Part H of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (P.L. 99-457) mandated that 
families play a significant role in all aspects of developing and implementing early 
intervention programs for infants and toddlers. The Act also specifically called for 
states to adopt family-focused practices in these programs, in the belief that this will 
have a stronger and more beneficial effect than more traditional approaches to early 
intervention. However, the implementation of the Act has translated into a variety of 
actual program models and practices. The present study, conducted by the 
Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare, Office of Mental Retardation, in 
conjunction with the Allegheny-Singer Research Institute, will clarify the nature and 
consequences of this variety by evaluating the differential characteristics and effects of 
different family-oriented approaches to early intervention in the state of Pennsylvania. 

The twin purposes of the study are to: 1) operationally differentiate among at least 
three family-oriented approaches (family-allied, family-focused and family-centered), 
and 2) to relate these differences, in turn, to differences in child, parent, and family 
functioning. The study will seek to determine whether different family-oriented 
approaches do have differential outcomes and, if so, to discern some of the processes 
underlying these differences. 

Two sub-studies will be conducted over a 24-month period. The first will use multiple 
sources and methods to place 75 early intervention programs on a continuum of family 
orientation and then examine the effects of this placement on a variety of family and 
child outcomes, including family well-being, parental locus of control, the distribution 
of time spent in various activities, and child developmental status. A number of data 
analysis strategies will be used to produce converging evidence to either support or 
refute the contention that different family-oriented approaches to early intervention 
have differential influences on child, parent and family functioning. 




The second sub-study, to be conducted with a purposive sub-sample from the first 
study representing programs and participants with different types of family orientation, 
will be a more in-depth investigation designed to elucidate the processes operating to 
produce the relationships found in the first sub-study. This sub-study will use a variety 
of qualitative and quantitative methods, including interviews, and will employ an 
intensive case study approach. 

The findings from this study will be used to inform policymakers about those aspects 
of Part H program rules and regulations that need to be specified to insure that policy 
gets translated into practice. The findings will also be translated into action steps that 
program directors can follow to improve the delivery of early intervention services.

as a Result of Education Reform Efforts'* 

Project Director: Deborah Barnett 

Cost: Federal Share = $88,438 
Agency Share = $68750 
Total = $157,188 

Project Period: October 1, 1993 to September 30, 1994 
Abstract: 

In 1991, South Dakota initiated a process of school restructuring throughout the state 
in response to articulation of the National Education Goals. To date, 20 school districts 
are involved in the initiative: 8 districts are beginning their third year of participation, 
another 8 districts are entering their second year, and 4 districts are in their first year 
of involvement with the program. The state intends that restructuring be achieved 
within the whole school and on behalf of all students, including those receiving special 
education services. 

In conjunction with this statewide initiative, the current study sets forth an overall 
objective to examine the extent to which special education programs and students are 
involved in the reform efforts and to determine the effects of the reforms on special 
education programs, services, instruction, personnel, and students. The ultimate 
product of the evaluation study will be recommendations regarding factors that impact 
individual student outcomes. 

The evaluation design focuses on systemic issues at three levels - state, district, and 
building /classroom — as guided by the following questions of interest. 

• To what extent do existing state policies, rules, and funding 
mechanisms support the inclusion of special education in 
educational reform efforts? 

• To what extent do current district-level education reform plans 
and activities include special education issues and needs of 
students with disabilities? 

• To what extent do current education reform plans and 
activities at the school building/classroom level include special 
education issues and needs of students with disabilities?

Project Period: October 1, 1993 to September 20, 1995 

Abstract: 

This evaluation study is being conducted by the Vermont Department of Education 
along with Trinity College and the University of Vermont. The evaluation is designed 
in four parts: (1) to assess the impact of recent changes in state legislation and policy 
on local school policies and practices; (2) to measure the impact of changes in local 
policies and practices on delivery of special education services; (3) to determine the 
impact of both state and local changes on outcomes for students with disabilities and 
their families; and (4) to measure the success levels of students currently served 
through special education programs. For parts (2) through (4) of the evaluation, three 
groups of students will be studied: (a) at-risk students who would have been referred 
to special education prior to the recent changes; (b) students who have been found 
ineligible for special education; and (c) students who continue to receive special 
education. 

These evaluation goals will be addressed through a variety of data collection activities. 
These activities will include: 

• A statewide survey of all (60) special education administrators 
(all Supervisory Unions in the state). 

• In-depth case studies of two elementary, two middle, and two 
secondary schools (using purposeful selection of specific 
schools with the largest recent decreases in special education 
enrollments;. 

• Surveys designed to describe, in depth, a sample of 540 
students referred to instructional support teams in a sample of 
180 schools (60 each - elementary, middle, and secondary 
schools). Data regarding the students will be obtained through 
educational records as well as from interviews with students, 
teachers, school principals, and parents. Data will also be 
collected on each school's policies, procedures, and practices.

PROFILES OF THE PROGRAM AGENDA 



Technology, Educational Media, and Materials Program 
Division of Innovation and Development 
Office of Special Education Programs 



I. Context for the Agenda Process 

To set forth an agenda for the Technology, Educational Media, and Materials Program, 
community members were asked to identify the advances needed for improving the 
quality, use, and access of technology, educational media, and materials to achieve 
better outcomes for children and youth with disabilities. 



II. Components of the Agenda 



Program Mission 

To improve outcomes for individuals with disabilities by advancing the creation, 
evaluation, and use of tools that enable students with disabilities for life-long learning, 
inclusion, and productivity. 



Targets for the Program 

Enable the Learner . The Program will foster the creation of state-of-the-art instructional 
environments, both in and out of school. Technology, educational media, and materials 
will be used to enable students with disabilities to access knowledge, develop skills and 
problem-solving strategies, and engage in educational experiences necessary for their 
success to participate fully in our society. 

Promote Effective Policy . The Program will promote supportive policy making at all 
levels in government, schools, and business. Such policies should ensure accessibility, 
availability, effective application, and consistent use of appropriate technology, media, 
and materials. The policies will recognize that these tools are essential to achieving 
better lifelong outcomes for individuals with disabilities. 

Improve Use Through Professional Development . The Program will encourage 
investigation of approaches and strategies for training and supporting teachers, 
administrators, parents, and related service personnel on the uses of instructional and 
assistive technologies. This broad group of consumers needs to know what is available 
and how it can best be used for individuals with disabilities. Acting on such 
knowledge, they can increase productive use of instructional time; prepare students 
with disabilities for employment and citizenship; and promote their intellectual, ethical, 
cultural, and physical growth. 



C 1 

16th Annual Rbport To Congress: Appendix F i " I 

er|c 6 ^ 



Create Innovative Tools , The program will encourage and support development of 
varied and integrated technologies, media, and materials which open up and expand 
the lives of those with disabilities. This can be accomplished by individuals, 
corporations, or agencies dedicated to improving the educational, social, occupational, 
and cultural opportunities for all students. Their work should enable individuals with 
disabilities to achieve the outcomes expected of all students-independence, self- 
determination, and a quality of life that is productive and personally satisfying. 

III. Next Steps for the Agenda Process 



Program staff will systematically align the strategies to foster the achievement of the 
program targets. Program staff will gain momentum for the agenda by building 
networks of communities committed to achieving the advances set forth in the agenda. 
The program agenda will be published for final review and comment.

I. Context for Agenda Process 

To set forth an agenda for the Special Studies Program, community members were 
asked to identify the information needed to support broad systemic change for 
achieving better outcomes for students with disabilities. 

II. Components of the Agenda 



Program Mission 

To contribute to the creation of a comprehensive educational and support system in 
which there is a collective responsibility for providing inclusive programs and 
individually determined services as a means of meeting unique and diverse needs and 
insuring successful outcomes for all children. 

Program Information Needs 

Management and Regulatory Flexibility . In order to stimulate the integration and 
participation of children with disabilities in a full variety of regular education settings, 
promote continuity of services, serve a wider range of children at risk of educational 
failure, and realize better outcomes for all children, management and regulatory 
flexibility are needed. 

Accountability for Outcomes . To enable the tracking of student progress and the 
generating of feedback for ongoing system improvement, we need to inculcate into 
educational systems accountability for the outcome of each child's schooling and 
performance of a comprehensive, community based, family oriented system of 
education and support. 

Community Supported Schools . To meet the complex and varied needs of students and 
their families, we need community supported schools that will become the focal point 
for family participation in activities and services that foster the development of all 
children. 



ERLC 



16th Annual Report To Congress: Appendix F 

651 



F-3 



School Oriented Personnel Development Environment and Strategies . To expand the 
capacity of schools to respond to the diversity of student characteristics and learning 
requirements, we need to reconfigure the relationships and responsibilities of staff and 
create a professional environment of continued development capable of improving the 
learning of all children. 

Interagency Collaboration . Families need to be able to enter a comprehensive system 
of services at any point rather than separately access programs and services from 
several agencies. In order to reduce gaps in services and realize the full use of existing 
resources, we need to expand system capacity through interagency collaboration. 

Technological Capacity . In order to meet the challenge of remaining current related to 
an expanding professional knowledge base, developing professional networks, tracking 
tasks and performance, and increasing responsiveness to informational requests, we 
need to develop strategies that utilize the existing and emerging technological capacity 
to obtain, store, analyze and generate knowledge bases. 



III. Next Steps for the Agenda Process 



Program staff will solicit input from organizations and communities to further confirm 
the agenda for the Special Studies Program. The program agenda will be published for 
final review and comment.

Program for Children and Youth with Serious Emotional Disturbance 
Division of Innovation and Development 
Office of Special Education Programs 



I. Context for the Agenda Process 

In 1990, Congress authorized a new program for children and youth with serious 
emotional disturbance (SED) under Part C (Section 627) of the Individuals with 
Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). IDEA also mandated a participatory planning 
process, involving multiple stakeholders in the development of program goals, 
objectives, strategies, and priorities for all programs administered by the Office of 
Special Education Programs (OSEP), including the new program for children and youth 
with SED. Since 1990, OSEP's Division of Innovation and Development (DID) has 
sponsored numerous meetings and discussions, including teleconferences and focus 
groups, to implement this planning process and to develop, evaluate, and disseminate 
a national agenda for achieving better results for children and youth with SED. 

II. Components of the National Agenda 

Mission and Vision 

The Mission is: Achieving better results for students with serious emotional disturbance. The 
Vision is: A reorientation and national preparedness to foster the emotional development and 
adjustment of children and youth with or at risk of developing serious emotional disturbance, 
as the critical foundation for realizing their potential at school, work, and in the community. 

Program Targets 

(1) Expand Positive Learning Opportunities and Results . To foster the provision of 
engaging, useful and positive learning opportunities. These opportunities should be 
result-driven and should acknowledge as well as respond to the experiences and needs 
of children and youth with serious emotional disturbance. 

(2) Strengthen School and Community Capacity . To foster initiatives that strengthen 
the capacity of schools and communities to serve students with serious emotional 
disturbance in the least restrictive environments appropriate. 

(3) Value and Address Diversity . To encourage culturally competent and linguistically 
appropriate exchanges and collaborations among families, professionals, students, and 
communities. These collaborations should foster equitable outcomes for all students 



and result in the identification and provision of services that are responsive to issues 
of race, culture, gender, and social and economic status. 

(4) Collaborate with Families . To foster collaborations that fully include family 
members on the team of service providers that implements family focused services to 
improve educational outcomes. Services should be open, helpful, culturally competent, 
accessible to families, and school- as well as community-based. 

(5) Promote Appropriate Assessment . To promote practices ensuring that assessment 
is integral to the identification, design, and delivery of services for children and youth 
with SED. These practices should be culturally appropriate, ethical, and functional. 

(6) Provide Ongoing Skill Development and Support . To foster the enchancement of 
knowledge, understanding, and sensitivity among all who work with children and 
youth with and at risk of developing serious emotional disturbance. Support and 
development should be ongoing and aim at strengthening the capacity of families, 
teachers, service providers, and other stakeholders to collaborate, persevere, and 
improve outcomes for children and youth with SED. 

(7) Create Comprehensive and Collaborative Systems . To promote systems change 
resulting in the development of coherent services built around the individual needs of 
children and youth with and at risk of developing serious emotional disturbance. 
These services should be family-centered, community-based, and appropriately funded. 

III. Next Steps for the Agenda Process 

Program staff continue to sc cit input from the practice and research communities to 
validate the targets and define strategies for successfully implementing the agenda. 
Current efforts include sharing, refining, and gaining support for the agenda through 
meetings and discussions, both with other governmental agencies (e.g., mental health, 
child welfare, and juvenile justice) and with associations and foundations, to assist 
OSEP in strategic planning related to the Program for Children and Youth with Serious 
Emotional Disturbance and to foster and provide national leadership and 
encouragement for greater collaboration and cooperation among all the agencies and 
institutions that can work together to improve results for children with SED and their 
families.

Recruitment and Retention: 



Expand and maintain a valid, comprehensive body of knowledge on effective 
recruitment and retention strategies. 

Create outreach and information services that will encourage persons with ability and 
commitment to explore and prepare for careers in special education, related services, 
and early intervention. In particular, these information services should give attention 
to culturally and linguistically diverse persons, and individuals with disabilities.

L Context for the Agenda Process 



To set forth an agenda for the Program for Children with Severe Disabilities, program 
staff solicited input from the community members to refine the vision and 
conceptualization of an integrated lifestyle for individuals with severe disabilities. 



EL Components of the Agenda 

Mission 

The mission for the Program is to improve outcomes for individuals with severe 
disabilities as measured by an integrated lifestyle. 

In order for the Program for Children with Severe Disabilities to achieve this mission, 
an operational definition of an integrated lifestyle was formed by program staff. 
Community members who serve children with severe disabilities were asked to further 
refine the definition. The operational definition of an integrated lifestyle includes 
aspects and indicators. 



Targets 



Seven aspects define an integrated lifestyle. These aspects are: education; employment; 
social relationships; self-determination; recreation and leisure; neighborhood and 
community; and home. While the aspects serve to bind the concepts of an integrated 
lifestyle, indicators operationalize the definition. See table F.l for the aspects and 
indicators of an integrated lifestyle for children with severe disabilities. 



III. ' Next Steps 



To set forth program targets for an integrated lifestyle, program staff solicited input 
from the community. Currently, they are analyzing the data to refine the program 
agenda. Data analysis will contribute to addressing the following planning steps: 

1. Identify the challenges associated with achieving each aspect 

of an integrated lifestyle. 



^ F " 1 0 16m Annual Report To Congress: Appendix F 

ERIC 65 o 



2. Identify the action steps that should occur in the next five 

years to achieve each aspect of an integrated lifestyle. 



3. Identify how OSEP should facilitate the action steps associated 
with each aspect of an integrated lifestyle. 

4. Identify other organizations and agencies with key roles to 
play in achieving an integrated lifestyle. 

Following the analysis of the data, program staff will refine the strategic targets and 
align the program strategies with the targets for the Program for Children with Severe 
Disabilities.

Through the Secondary Education and Transitional Services for Youth with Disabilities 
Program, OSEP awards cooperative agreements and grants to institutions of higher 
education, SEAs, LEAs, and other public and non-profit institutions to assist youth with 
disabilities make the transition from secondary school to postsecondary life. Seven 
different funding activities took place in 1993. This appendix briefly describes each 
activity. 



State Systems for Transition Services for Youth with Disabilities 

Through this program, OSEP awarded $13,964,000 for six new cooperative agreements 
and 24 continuation projects in 1993. The program supports one-time, five-year 
cooperative agreements for joint applications from the SEA and the vocational 
rehabilitation agency (or another State agency providing transition services). These 
projects are designed to: 

• increase the availability, access, and quality of transition 
services; 

• improve the ability of professionals, parents, and advocates to 
assist youth in transition; 

• improve coordination and collaboration among service 
providers; and 

• create an incentive for accessing and using the expertise and 
resources of programs and projects that have developed 
successful transition services for youth with disabilities. 

The six new projects awarded in 1993 were to SEA in Florida, Indiana, Michigan, New 
Jersey, Ohio, and Wisconsin. 



Model Demonstration Projects to Identify, Recruit Train, and Place Youth with 
Disabilities Who Have Dropped Out of School 

Through this program, OSEP funded nine new grants and two continuation grants 
totalling $1,013,000 in 1993. The program supports model demonstration projects 
implementing effective strategies to identify, recruit, train, and place youths with 
disabilities who have dropped out of school Descriptions of some of the new grants 
are below. 

The National Association of Rehabilitation Facilities, in Washington, D.C, will 
provide students with an alternative means of earning the academic credits and 
skills necessary to live and work within the community. The project combines an 
emphasis on personal futures planning, self-determination, peer counseling, job 
clubs, and paid work experiences.

ERIC 67$ 



Transcen, Inc., in Rockville, Maryland, will identify factors that lead to successful 
transitions from school to work for at-risk youth with disabilities, and will 
determine how these factors can be applied to dropouts. The project will include 
research, outreach, assessment, planning, placement, and follow-up activities. 

Richmond Unified School District, in San Pablo, California, will develop a 
comprehensive community-based service delivery model to address the needs of 
youth with disabilities. Assessment of the effectiveness of program components 
will be used to validate successful strategies. 

The University of Hawaii, in Honolulu, will address case management and 
interagency coordination issues through planning and development, field testing, 
and demonstration of model interventions. An in-depth follow-up of school 
dropouts will be used to profile risks, initiate dropout prevention strategies, assist 
in program planning, and identify and recruit dropouts for the program. 

Tewish Vocational Service, Inc., in Boston, will emphasize community involvement 
and draw on successful models to prepare dropouts for employment and 
independence. The project will broaden the capacity of service providers to assist 
youth with disabilities who face barriers to employment. The project will 
specifically target multi-cultural populations. 

School-Bus i ness Partnerships of Long Island, in Melville, New York, will 
demonstrate community -based efforts to provide employment and independent 
living opportunities for youth with disabilities. An evaluation instrument will be 
designed to assess the success of a model that utilizes a network of community- 
based partners to provide youth with disabilities who have left school means to 
complete their school programs and at the same time obtain exposure to the work 
place. 



Institute to Evaluate and Provide Technical Assistance to States Implementing 
Cooperative Projects to Improve Transition Services 

The National Transition Network (NTN) center at the University of Minnesota received 
$588,000 to help States provide secondary transition services for youth with disabilities. 
The NTN is a collaborative effort among a number of universities and technical 
assistance centers across the country. It provides evaluation and technical assistance to 
States implementing cooperative agreements funded under the State Systems for 
Transition Services for Youth with Disabilities Program. 



Demonstration Projects to Identify and Teach Skills Necessary for Self- 
Determination 

Through this program, OSEP funded six new grants and 14 continuation projects in 
1993. The program supports model demonstration projects that identify the skills and 



H-2 16th Annual Report To Congress: Appendix H 

erJc 67g 



characteristics necessary for self-determination, as well as the in-school and out-of- 
school experiences that lead to the development of self-determination. 



The Spina Bifida Association of Kentucky will develop and implement a 
curriculum of in-school and out-of-school experiences with which to prepare 
children and youth with spina bifida, as well as their parents, to assume 
responsibility for self-determination in their personal lives and as they interact 
with health and education systems to obtain needed services. 

The University of Alaska at Anchorage will produce a method to teach skills 
necessary for self-determination by combining video feedforward techniques with 
personal futures planning. 

Colorado State University, in Fort Collins, will demonstrate a model process 
resulting in outcomes for individuals with disabilities that reflect their personal 
choices, including direct assessment of seJf-de termination skills, person-centered 
planning processes, and teaching strategies to achieve self-determined futures. 

The Oregon Research Institu te, in Eugene, will develop a model for enhancing 
opportunities for the development of self-determination skills of secondary and 
transition age youth with developmental disabilities. 

The Teachers College at Columbia University will employ four innovative and 
unique strategies to improve the self-determination of transition-aged students in 
school and community-based programs in New York City. 

The Richmond Unified School District, in San Pablo, California, will develop 
teaching strategies to enhance assertiveness, creativity, self-advocacy, and 
decision-making skills for youth with disabilities. 

Research Projects on the Transition of Special Populations to Integrated 
Postsecondary Environments 

Through this program, OSEP awarded four new grants and ten continuation grants 
totalling $1,697,000 in 1993. It supports researching effective strategies to provide 
transitional services to youth with disabilities age 16 through 21 who are moving from 
one setting to another. Projects must focus on at least one of the following special 
populations: adjudicated youth with disabilities; youth with serious emotional 
disturbance; or youth with severe physical disabilities, including traumatic brain injury. 

The Institute for Rehabilitation and Research, Brain Injury Research Center, in 
Houston, Texas, will study whether participation in a model, post-acute, 
community-based transition program results in greater short-term and long-term 
community integration for youth with moderate to severe traumatic brain injuries. 



The Integrated Resou rces Institute, in Irvine, California, will emphasize job 
supports including mentoring, internal coaching, consultive training, and job 
sharing for youth with serious emotional disturbances and severe physical 
disabilities. 

Transcen, Inc., in Rockville, Maryland, will utilize the qualitative multiple case 
study design to identify significant variables that contribute to successful 
transition for youth with serious emotional disturbance and/or mental illness. 

The University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, will develop a profile of adjudicated 
youth with disabilities and provide a comprehensive model for providing effective 
transitional services and strategies for this special population. 



v/lulti-District Outreach Projects 

Through this program, OSEP provided $1,038,000 for eight continuation grant projects 
to enhance the capacity of LEAs by promoting implementation of proven transition 
service models, or selected components of those models, in multiple districts within a 
State. Staff training, technical assistance, information sharing, and on-site observation 
of model programs are designed to accomplish model implementation. The grantees 
are: 

• Georgia State University, 

• University of New Orleans, 

• Marriot Foundation for People with Disabilities, 

• Arizona Department of Education 

• Kent State University, 

• Wayne State University, 

• Parents Education Advocacy Training Center, and 

• North Santa Cruz County SELPA. 



Institute on Intervention Effectiveness 

The Institute, located at the University of Illinois in Urbana, was funded at $912,000 in 
1993. It focuses on applied problems of youth in transition from high school to post- 
secondary education, employment, adult and community living, and social integration. 
Its research team is developing three intervention programs. The transition planning 
and employment-related intervention research programs will attempt to validate new

intervention strategies. There will also be an evaluation study with the goal to 
identifying effective intervention approaches and their related outcomes, and a study 
analyzing secondary education, employment, and independent living outcomes of 
youth in transition.
