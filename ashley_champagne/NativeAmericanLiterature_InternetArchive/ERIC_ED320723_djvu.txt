ABSTRACT 

This bibliography lists available literature relating 
to the American Indians of Appalachia. Containing approximately 540 
entries, the list includes publications on American Indians from 
prehistoric times up to the present. The materials focus primarily on 
the Shawnee and Cherokee tribes, which inhabited portions of what is 
now called central Appalachia, embracing the mountainous parts of 
Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee, and North 
Carolina. The listed citations touch upon areas of history, 
sociology, anthropology, and archeology, giving researchers access to 
information on the world of the Appalachian Indian: eating habits, 
migration routes, the use of African -American slaves, hunting 
grounds, medicines, relations with ether Indians and White cclonial 
powers, political systems, and intra-tribal struggles. Aside from 
Appalachian states, the cited literature also extends to surrounding 
areas, where the Shawnee and Cherokee carried their influence. This 
bibliography includes monographs, periodical articles, museum papers, 
bibliographies, handbooks, and other types of documents, organized 
alphabetically by authors and titles. (TES)

INTRODUCTION 



Too often, the mountainous region of Central Appaiachia has 
been conceived of as the detain of English and Scotch- Irish 
immigrants, with pockets of Germans, Irish, Italians, 
African- Americans, Slavs, and Hungarians in coal mining areas and 
centers of economic activity. Such an understanding of a 
homogeneous racial and ethnic stock is quite deficient and 
misleading; it omits a major racial component that has stamped the 
culture for what it is — namely, the Native American. 

American Indians and their prehistoric ancestors have known 
this region as home or hunting grounds from time immemorial. The 
expulsion of the Indian tribes from their fertile valleys in the 
nineteenth century through a succession of broken contracts was 
incomplete. Many Native Americans — individuals, families, or 
bands — managed to retain their Appalachian roots by retreating 
farther into the coves and valleys of the region, and, in many 
cases, by intermarrying into pioneer families. American Indian 
survival in the mountains is a sign of the stamina and 
determination of these indigenous peoples. 

Except for the Cherokees in western North Carolina, many 
Appalachian Indian people have lost contact with their tribal 
roots, and have, in some cases, even ceased to appreciate their 
own identity as Native Americans. Even more so, they have been 
unable to develop an appreciation of their contribution to what is 
Appalachian. 

A closer investigation of Appalachian ways and cultural 
aspects — music and instruments, cadence, manner of organizing, 
burial practices, foods and crops, favorite herbs and animals, 
celebration, prayer rhythms, commercial routes, trails and 
gathering places, story-telling and stories, recreation and 
pastimes, humor, and geological treasures have a stamp of the 
American Indian subculture. 

At Appaiachia- -Science in the Public Interest (ASPI), we have 
attempted to take a serious look at this hidden American Indian 
component of our Appalachian cultural heritage. This bibliography 
of pertinent literature is a beginning. To date, we know of no 
such compilation. We see this as both helping our own ASPI Indian 
research and benefitting a broader range of scholars and interested 
people desiring to know more about the Appalachian/American Indian 
connection. 

This bibliography includes both prehistoric and more recent 
American Indian inhabitants of Central Appaiachia. Delineating 
the geographic boundaries of our research efforts is difficult. 
Prehistoric and American Indian tribes did not see the region cut 
into its half dozen states, hundreds of counties, or a federally 
designated "Appalachian Region." For this reason, the author, 



Timothy Collins, has focused primarily on the Cherokee and Shawnee 
tribes, which inhabited portions cf what is now termed "Central 
Appalachia, " embracing the mountainous parts of the states of Ohio, 
West Virginia, Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee, and North Carolina. 
In many cases, there is an expansion of the literature cited to 
include surrounding lands where both tribes ranged or had extended 
commercial interests . 

While the Native American understanding of the land was 
different from ours, it was not uniform. The more or less 
permanently settled Cherokee were quite different from migrating 
bands of Shawnee who ranged over much of the eastern half of the 
present-day United States. The Cherokes did not use land surveys 
or recorded deeds, and even after they did acquire legal title 
through treaties with the fledgling United States, the government 
eventually forced them from their lands when President Andrew 
Jackson disobeyed a Supreme Court ruling upholding the original 
treaty . 

This bibliography goes beyond mere history and embraces 
anthropology, archeology, and sociology. The literature opens for 
the researcher the world of the Appalachian Indian: eating habits, 
migration routes, use of African-American slaves, hunting grounds, 
medicines, relations with other Indians and white colonial powers, 
political systems, intra-tribal struggles, and many other aspects. 
We are often unaware of how much really is known, but has not been 
popularized. Our hopes are to eventually make this material 
available in some form to the descendants of the earlier 
inhabitants or this land who will come ^o appreciate their heritage 
all the more. 

We hope you find the materials listed here useful. Through 
this compilation, we have beei; able to learn more about settlement 
of Kentucky during various historic periods. We also have been 
able to publish a map showing the American Indian influence in 
Central Appalachia. We have been able to delineate certain areas 
for further research to help raise Native American consciousness. 

We would like to thank the Cambridge Center for Social Studies 
and the Appa: ^chian Community Development Association for funds to 
help develop this bibliography.
