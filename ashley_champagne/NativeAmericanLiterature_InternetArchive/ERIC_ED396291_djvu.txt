American schools are becoming more culturally diverse. 

With the gro%rth in enrollment of students belonging to racial 
and/or ethnic minority groups. To effectively educate these 
students, teachers must provide them with learning experiences 
which reflect their cultural backgrounds. The failure to provide 
these students with such* experiences rejects the value of their 
culture, denies their existence, and fails to facilitate 
their academic achievement. 

Arlene Barry contends that "curriculum content that builds on 
a child's experiences and background can be more easily incorp- 
orated in the existing cognitive structure" (1990). Marie Clay 
asserts that effective teachers assist minority-group students in 
their efforts to make "cultural connections" in the learning 
process (1986). Consequently, the failure to provide culturally 
diverse students with culturally relevant materials from which to 
learn, is likely to hamper learning. Many educators recognize that 
textbooks currently in use in our schools do not adequately reflect 
the cultural pluralism found in our society. One of the many ways 
in which teachers can address this deficit is by the use of 
multicultural children's literature. 

While the use of multicultural children's literature has bene- 
fits for students from culturally diverse backgrounds, it also has 
benefits for mainstream students. To educate these students in a 
manner which does not facilitate and encourage their recognition of 
the pluralistic nature of our society, is to provide them with an 
unrealistic view of our society. Moreover, such an approach does 
not prepare these students to responsibly participate in our 
increasingly interdependent world. 

An increasing number of students with exceptional needs (a 
term used here to refer only to those students with physical or 
emotional disabilities) are being mainstreamed. The successful 
integration of these students into mainstream classrooms demands 
the creating of a climate of acceptance. The use of children's 
literature which focuses on persons with disabilities is one way to 
address this need. The challenge faced by persona with 
disabilities in gaining recognition and acceptance from mainstream 
society is in many ways similar to that faced by racial and ethnic 
minorities. Thus, children's literature focused on the character 
of persons with disabilities is included in this bibliography. 

The thoughtful selection of multicultural children's literature 
for classroom use is essential for appropriate and effective

•nrichiflicnt of Instruction. Ths following is a listing of sobs of 
ths factors which tsachsrs should consider whan salscting books for 
classroom uss: 

- Evaluats ths literary merit of books to be used. 

- Avoid using literature which perpetuates stereotypes. 

- Avoid the use of books containing illustrations which 
do not authentically portray the physical diversity of 
the particular racial or ethnic group of focus. 

- Do not assume that a book is appropriate to use simply 
because the author is a member of the group about which 
he has written. 

- Seek to achieve a balance between the use of books 
written from an historical perspective and thene written 
from a current day perspective. 

- Seek to achieve a balance between the use of books about 
well-known persons and those written about ordinary 
people. 

- Remember that diversity exists within groups. 

- When choosing literature for curricula, use an 
integrative rather than an additive approach. 

Consult book reviews of the literature. 

- Become knowledgeable about the culture and history of 
groups you plan to teach about. 

Although all of the books in this bibliography have been 
assigned a grade use level, this designation is not "etched in 
stone". The manner in which a book is used and the purpose for its 
use greatly Influence the appropriateness of its use. While most 
of the books listed here are picture books, this classification 
does not negate the learning value of using these books beyond the 
elementary school . level. As Bishop and Hickman note in their 
article in Bevond Wo rds; Picture Books for Older Readers and 
Writers. 

"Four or Fourteen or Forty: Picture Books are for Everyone".
