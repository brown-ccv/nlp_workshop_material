Teacher Perceptions of Authentic Pedagogy: 

A Case Study of Professional Development in an African American 
High School’s Government Class 

Christopher Andrew Brkich 

University of Florida 

Many American educators, from John Dewey forward, have been 
calling for rigorous academic experiences that not only will challenge 
schoolchildren intellectually but also prepare them for lives as active, 
participatory, and contributory citizens. Recently, Newmann, King and 
Carmichael (2007) developed an applicable, cross-disciplinary framework 
which aims to facilitate increasingly authentic classroom experiences, 
which the authors define as building upon students’ content knowledge 
through a process of disciplined inquiry while making valued connections 
to students’ lives - past, present, and future - beyond the walls of the 
school. 

Even though research has demonstrated that teaching in this 
fashion results in increased levels of achievement for all students, 
particularly those of nonwhite and socioeconomically disadvantaged 
backgrounds, it is generally not done. Reasons often cited are curricula of 
content coverage, a culture of teacher isolation, and insufficient time 
(Onosko, 1991). However, extant research most significantly does not 
address classroom teachers’ experiences when teaching students using 
authentic means. Given that teachers have a great deal of control over both 
the content material they present their students and the fashion in which

STUDIES ANNUAL CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS

their students experience that content, an examination of this area is of 
critical importance. 

This paper presentation sought to remediate this lacuna by raising 
and exploring the following questions: What are the features of teacher 
experiences in using authentic pedagogy in predominantly African 
American high school social studies classrooms? and What has been the 
effect of the No Child Left Behind Act ("No Child Left Behind Act," 
2001) on the inclusion of authentic pedagogy in predominantly African 
American high school social studies classrooms? In answering these 
questions, I offered a brief literature review on barriers to higher order 
thinking in the classroom, on the effects of standardised testing on the 
educational experiences and outcomes of African American students, and 
on teachers’ perceptions of standardised, high-stakes assessments. I then 
proceeded to examine two high school social studies teachers’ 
experiences, both of whom having worked in high schools populated 
predominantly by African American students. Using an adaptation of the 
Stevick-Colaizzi-Keen method of transcendental phenomenology 
(Moustakas, 1994), I developed first textural descriptions, then structural 
descriptions, and finally combined textural-structural descriptions of my 
respondents’ experiences in teaching African American students using 
authentic pedagogy to come to grasp the essence of their experiences.

Characteristics of Effective Secondary Level History Teachers 

Brad Burenheide 

Kansas State University 

This session will explore the results of a qualitative study that 
serves as a beginning to the discussion of what teachers of history do well. 
The study involved the interviewing and reviewing of materials from 
secondary level teachers of history who have been identified by their peers 
as outstanding teachers of history. The study focused on the following 
three questions: 

1. What are the methods employed by “good teachers of 
history?” 

2. What are the core beliefs regarding the teaching of 
history possessed by “good teachers of history?” 

3. Are the traits and characteristics of “good teachers of 
history” inherent or could they possibly be learned and 
developed? 

The findings of the study show these high quality teachers of 
history have their students explore the discipline of history, believe 
strongly in the lessons gleaned from historical study, and provide hope 
that these characteristics can be learned and encouraged in young teachers 
in the training and induction phase of teacher education.

Teaching Secondary Social Studies in Inner-City Schools 

Chris Busey 

Evans Maynard High School 

This presentation will offer various methods and teaching strategies 
which social studies educators can utilize when teaching inner-city 
students. Inner-city schools serve as the place where some of the most at- 
risk children in American society receive their education. While poverty is 
the most obvious factor that determines the make-up of an inner-city 
student, there are more influential factors such as crime, emotional 
neglect, absent parents, language, social and cultural barriers. The inner- 
city student is a special student, whose experiences are often difficult to 
relate to. It is important that educators are aware of the many issues they 
may face when teaching in an inner-city school, as well as the importance 
of making social studies relevant to students by utilizing various methods, 
strategies, concepts and ideas. After the presentation, participants will: 

1. Have an understanding of the many issues inner-city students 
encounter on a daily basis. 

2. Be able to implement various strategies or methods which may be 
useful in the social studies classroom. 

3. Analyze the importance of making social studies content relevant 
to students, especially inner-city students. 

4. Share assignments, projects, and methods of assessment that they 
have found successful in their classrooms.

Using the 2008 Election to Teach Political and Social Concepts 

Chris Busey 

Evans Maynard High School 

Stewart Waters 

University of Central Florida 

This presentation will discuss how social studies teachers can 
explore different concepts of the 2008 presidential election that stretch 
beyond race. There were many other important underlying themes in the 
election such as upward social-class mobility, divided government, and 
equality of opportunity in America. It is also important that teachers stress 
media literacy to the students, because more often than not, the media 
considered this election to be important and a milestone, due to the fact 
that Barack Obama is the first African-American president. After the 
presentation, participants will be able to discuss the election in a manner 
where their opinion does not influence students, and sometimes 
controversial topics such as social status, can be discussed in a manner 
that promotes diversity and a safe classroom environment. Also, 
participants will understand the value of including multiple perspectives in 
the social studies classroom.

Culturally Responsible Teaching: 

A Pedagogical Approach for the Social Studies Classroom 

Brandon M. Butler 
Alexander Cuenca 

University of Georgia 



"Pedagogy" in educational literature is often used to describe the 
methods teachers employ in the classroom. While the technical dimension 
of pedagogy is important in the education of children, the appropriation of 
the term “pedagogy” in this manner is problematic because it ignores the 
relational nature of teaching. Van Manen (1994) suggests that if one draws 
on the European roots of the term, pedagogy is more than simply the act of 
teaching; instead it implies a “personal commitment and interest in 
children’s education and their growth toward mature adulthood” (p. 139). 
Thus, pedagogy signifies more than practice, it describes the distinct 
relationship between teacher and student, a relationship animated by the 
responsibility of the teacher to do what is good for the child. 

Drawing on the teachers’ inherent responsibility in the 
pedagogical relationship and the need for students to develop “the 
knowledge skills and attitudes needed to live effectively in a world 
characterized by ethnic diversity, cultural pluralism, and increasing 
interdependence” (Merryfield, 2001, p. 13), we suggest social studies 
teachers frame their work in a culturally responsible manner. In preparing 
students for a world moving “from a size small to a size tiny” (Friedman, 
2005), the responsibility of the teacher demands a just representation of all 



14 






THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR THE SOCIAL 
STUDIES ANNUAL CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



Volume

Issue 1 



cultures. We frame the recognition that teachers are ultimately responsible 
for the vision of the world that their students inherit as culturally 
responsible social studies, an approach requiring: (1) a deep sense of 
responsibility to students; (2) the development of a critical cultural 
consciousness; and (3) the active questioning of commonsense curricular 
practices. 

Deep Sense of Responsibility 

According to van Manen (1994) “pedagogue” in the original Greek 
refers not to the teacher but to “the guardian whose responsibility it was to 
lead the young boy to school. . .the adult had the task of accompanying the 
child, of being with the child, of caring for the child” (p. 37). The teacher 
as modem day pedagogue is charged with the equally significant task of 
leading ehildren into mature adulthood in order to prepare them for 
society. As van Manen notes, the terms pedagogue and pedagogy are at 
their core governed by relationship and responsibility. The authority given 
to teachers, places them in a position of influence, allowing their actions to 
speak to the moral responsibility they bear for the welfare and 
development of the student. Therefore, as social studies teachers eharged 
with the responsibility to develop the dispositions of future citizens, each 
of our pedagogical actions must reflect this deep sense of responsibility 
for our students.

Critical Cultural Consciousness 

Critical cultural consciousness is grounded in the belief that 
teacher accountability involves being self-conscious, critical, and 
analytical about one’s teaching beliefs and behaviors and an understanding 
that teachers need to develop a deeper knowledge and awareness about 
cultural representations they present to their students (Gay & Kirkland, 
2003). Drawing on the notion of critical consciousness (Freire, 1974), we 
believe social studies teachers must develop an awareness of the 
mechanisms that reinscribe ‘othering’. As a form of reflection on the 
nature of the curriculum to reinforce images of the “other” as exotic, 
strange, or deficient, critical cultural consciousness begins with the critical 
examination of covert and overt cultural depictions that perpetuate deep 
cleaves between students and other cultures. 

To be critical of representations of culture perpetuated through the 
curriculum requires teachers to discern faulty arguments, hasty 
generalizations, and truth claims based on unreliable, ambiguous, or 
obscure authority (Burbules & Berk, 1999). Critical cultural consciousness 
leads teachers to be attentive to incomplete accounts of culture in the 
curriculum; reflectively questioning and internally deliberating the ways in 
which perspective and voices are absent or marginalized in cultural 
depictions. This stance allows social studies teachers to bring their actions 
in equilibrium with the responsibility they hold to present a just vision of 
culture, establishing a pattern where consciousness guides the conscious.

Questioning the Commonsense 

What teachers perceive as naturally occurring in schools exists as 
part of the ‘seduction of the everyday’ that makes up much of what we do 
as educators. These commonsense approaches are not new; instead they 
are perpetuated over time to the point they become part of the accepted 
culture of education. Kumashiro (2008) notes that “commonsense does not 
tell us that this is what schools could be doing; it tells us that this and only 
this is what schools should be doing” (p. 5). As a result, recognizing 
“commonsense” approaches to education asks us to challenge our 
perceptions of education and to become active in determining what and 
how we teach. As both an anticipatory and retrospective reflection on the 
action of teaching (van Manen, 1994), consciously recognizing the 
“commonsense” leads the teacher toward a cycle of critical reflection, 
which Dinkelman (1999) defines as “the consideration of the moral and 
ethical dimensions of teaching and deliberation on the broader social 
conditions of schooling” (p. 329). By being conscious of one’s own 
actions and how power operates in the classroom, teachers can begin to 
recognize when an activity or action compromises their moral 
responsibility to their students.

The Battle for Stalingrad: 

An Interactive Approach towards Learning about World War Two 

Jeff Byford 

University of Memphis 



Teaching about World War II, specifically significant battles, is 
often confusing and difficult for students to understand. Important battles, 
dates, and outcomes often become intertwined with lecture and excessive 
amounts of homework and irrelevant to students’ interests. Rather than 
traditional direct instruction, the use of simulations, particularly recreating 
important battles, is one method to engage in active learning and agents in 
the decision-making process. 

In a period of high-stakes testing and limited amounts of time 
devoted to content, pressures placed on teachers often minimize 
instruction to low-level drill and grill sessions. According to Anderson and 
Krathwohl (2000), the pace necessary to cover the emphasized content by 
a prescribed dates often require teachers to leave behind the higher-order 
thinking skills often reducing instruction to focus on potential test material 
and remediation. As a result, the accountability system requires a 
prescribed amount of content to be covered by a certain date; teachers 
often do not have time for student inquiry or a variety of instructional 
strategies. 

In an effort to avoid traditional rote memorization and worksheets 
to assess students’ knowledge over the Battle of Stalingrad and the war on 
the Eastern front, the simulation method was emphasized. The Battle for 



19

Stalingrad simulation evolved over a three year period from a simple 
visual explanation of one of the most important battles during World War 
II, into an hour-long or multi-day simulation that emphasizes planning, 
teamwork and competition among students. The rationale for designing 
such a simulation was based upon the need for differentiated instruction; 
the benefits simulations have in the classroom and to accommodate the 
different learning styles and needs of students (Russell & Byford, 2006). 

When designing the simulation, Drake’s (1997) three dimensions 
of alternative assessment were used as reference. First, students should 
demonstrate their knowledge of historical themes, facts and ideas. 
Second, students who complete alternative assessments should be able to 
demonstrate their ability to reason. And third, students should be able to 
communicate their historical knowledge with others. To help create an 
authentic and realistic environment, the classroom was decorated in both 
Soviet and German propaganda posters and maps on the walls. After 
students had the opportunity to formulate questions, receive general 
information for the rational and against the German invasion of the Soviet 
Union, students were asked to form groups of three to four students. After 
a class discussion over criteria and expectations, students were assigned 
either to defend Stalingrad (Russians) or defeat Stalingrad (Germans). 

Students were allowed to “battle plan” unit locations and 
movements. Students were encouraged to “think through” possible 
scenarios to complete their mission. This allowed the teacher the 
opportunity to give input about what was deemed realistic and unrealistic

in terms of tactics. When all group members finalized their plans, students 
provided the teacher with a final copy, illustrating each unit and an arrow 
illustrating their initial movement. 

The results of the simulation were promising. Students who 
participated in the simulation year after year often indicated their 
willingness to do activities that are not traditional classroom activities 
such as lecture, worksheets or note taking. This type of student 
engagement often allows for students to retain information in long-term 
memory, self-reflections and more meaningful to their lives (Chiodo and 
Byford, 2004; Driscoll, 2005, Krathwohl, 2002). Furthermore, this activity 
encourages students to compete against one another. Having students plan 
and execute plans of battle requires students to work as a team and use 
creativity to describe and implement their plan. Students have been 
stimulated to learn about the importance of critical battles that changed the 
course of war, but also the history of World War II as well.

Are We Ready for Another Curriculum Revolution? Evaluating the 
Strength and Weaknesses of the New Social Studies Projects 

Jeffrey Byford 
Eddie Thompson 
Cody Lawson 

University of Memphis 



The 1950s was considered by many as a decade of change. The 
emerging Civil Rights movement, advanced in medicine and technology 
are only a few examples of success. However, with success often comes 
controversy. After World War II, the social studies had, at best, a limited 
presence in our nation’s schools. This limited presence and perceived lack 
of importance would turn the social studies into a public lightning rod 
from 1950 to 1960. Criticism of the social studies came primarily in the 
form of five events, all of which served as a catalyst for reform: a) 
American Koran War prisoners lack of knowledge of Civil Rights, 
capitalism, and democracy; b) closed areas in both American society and 
education which neglected social issues as homosexuality, teen pregnancy 
and racial tension; c) American high school students lack of basic 
knowledge of democracy published by the 1957 Purdue Public Opinion 
Poll; d) the launching of Sputnik and advances in Soviet technology and 
education; and e) the growing Civil Rights movement, which openly 
challenged the nation’s education system and societal norms (Byford and 
Russell, 2007). At the end of the decade, scholars questioned the relevance 
and future of the social studies. Ultimately, three issues initiated 



23

STUDIES ANNUAL CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



curriculum reform: a) social studies failure to keep pace with curriculum 
movements found in both mathematics and the sciences; b) proposed new 
knowledge and curriculum would require new teaching strategies for each 
content discipline; and c) private funding (Ford and Carnegie 
Foundations) would initially fund research (Fenton, 1976). 

From 1960 to 1974, over fifty curriculum projects were designed 
and implemented. Each content area (i.e. anthropology, economics, 
geography. United States history, political science, sociology, and 
psychology and world history) produced a minimum of two projects. 
Perceived strengths illustrated universities, school districts and 
foundations abilities to create new material, increase children’s learning 
ability, increase both inquiry and the discussion process, firmly establish 
the social sciences, and provide classroom structure through the use of 
lesson plans and procedures. Perceived weaknesses suggested that only 
private or selected schools received extensive training and materials, the 
lack of training for “traditional” classrooms, materials were written by 
professors that were unable to understand classroom experiences and the 
amount of time devoted towards new material was outpaced by events in 
society (Knight, 1970).

Whitewashed: Social Studies and Race/ess Pedagogies 

Prentice T. Chandler 

Athens State University 

This paper examines the race related pedagogies of two white, 
male social studies teachers in north Alabama. Drawing on the analysis of 
two qualitative case studies related to how they taught about race within 
the context of their American history courses, the author argues that their 
teaching about race within their classes serves to reify and uphold white 
supremacy in the social studies curricula. The author describes the 
following themes that emerged throughout the research: 1) liberal, 
incremental process, 2) race neutrality and colorblindness, 3) fear of 
teaching about race, and 4) naturalization/essentialization of race. The 
analysis of how race is conceptualized by the teachers in this study is 
informed by critical race theory (CRT), social studies research, and Pierre 
Bourdieu’s notion of misrecognition. By utilizing CRT philosophy, he 
points to the idea that race, as a part of the formal and enacted curriculum 
is downplayed and overshadowed by more traditional explanations of race 
in US history. He argues that the social studies profession needs to make

Implications of this research point to a need to reconceptualize citizenship

Social Studies Professors Theorizing: 

Insights from Two Decades of Deliberation and Collaboration 

Richard H. Chant 
Jeffrey Cornett 

University of North Florida 

This session summarizes the interpretation and implementation of 
the Personal Practical Theories (PPTs) of two social studies teacher 
educators over a 20-year period. In 1989, the presenters met as student and 
instructor in a graduate social studies methods course. The instructor had 
established his PPTs and, as part of the course, had participants 
systematically identify their own PPTs and their impact on instruction. 
Over the next 20 years, the two interacted in a variety of formats that 
would influence one another as well as how they interpreted and 
implemented their core instructional beliefs - their PPTs. 

Recently, both teacher educators found themselves together again 
in a graduate social studies methods course, with the original instructor 
again teaching and the other member taking on the role of participant 
observer. Collectively, they used this course as an impetus to illustrate and 
describe how their experiences, both professional and relational, have 
influenced how they interpret and implement their PPTs as teacher 
educators. The presenters will share information related to the historical 
influences related to their experiences as well as initial findings from the 
current graduate methods course.

Revisiting Political Socialization in Secondary Education: 

A Study of Government Classes in Three Demographically Diverse 
Schools during the 2008 Presidential Election 

Wayne Journell 

University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign 

In this qualitative study, I observed six high school government 
classes from three schools in the Southwest Chicago suburbs during the 
2008 Presidential Election. The purpose of the study was to better 
understand the attention given to political events during a period of 
heightened political awareness. To accomplish this, I chose three schools 
that were diverse with respect to student demographics and political 
ideology. One school was located in an urban setting with large Latino and 
African-American populations, another was located in an all-white, rural 
setting, and the final school was a private Catholic school. 

I observed classes from each school from the start of school in 
August through the Presidential Election. On average, I observed each 
class approximately four times per week. In addition, I surveyed large 
numbers of freshmen and seniors in each building to determine the 
political ideology of each school, using the same survey as a pre and post 
test for the students in each of the six individual classes. Einally, I 
triangulated my observation and survey data with semi-structured 
interviews with the six teachers and representative samples of students in 
their classes.

What I found were very few overt political messages given in the 
classes, but many subtle messages that provided a stark contrast between 
the three schools and the way students in those populations’ 
conceptualized politics and the Presidential Election. Not surprisingly 
given the nature of the Presidential Race, I also observed many differences 
in the way students and teachers in each school conceptualized issues 
relating to race, gender, and controversial issues.

Heritage Language Learners and the Social Sciences 

Christopher John Kazanjian 

University of Texas, El Paso 

This review of literature seeks to diseover how the United States 
public school system deals with Heritage Language Learners in a modern 
global economy. The works of Wong & Motha (2007), Wright (2007), and 
Ricento (2005) have been reviewed for the purpose of this proposal. The 
findings of this research include the pressure placed on Heritage Language 
Learners to assimilate into the dominant American culture. In addition, the 
findings propose that the resources for creating a stable and successful 
Heritage Language program are lacking due to disinterests of state 
educational policy. The research unfolds the grim future of Heritage 
Language Programs and the disadvantage public school students have 
when entering a global economy. The social sciences play an integral part 
in Heritage Language Education. Aside from direct language instruction, 
policy makers must appreciate peripheral aspects of a student’s 
educational experience. The identity, culture, and heritage of students 
must be cultivated to properly prepare them to enter and compete in a 
global economy. Social sciences must become cognizant of the needs of 
HLL’s in order to coordinate effective instruction. Heritage Language 
instruction then becomes a component in the apparatus to pass on cultural 
connections. These connections serve to bring cultural appreciation and 
global cohesion among nations intertwined global economics.

Global Citizenship Education in the Classroom: 
A Collaborative Canadian Study 

Marianne Larsen 

University of Western Ontario 



Although global education (GE) has been a well-established 
curriculum field since the 1980s, interest amongst educators, education 
policy makers, curriculum writers and non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs) in bringing the global dimension to the classroom has spiked over 
the last few years. Current research demonstrates clearly the importance of 
teaching GE. As a result, a growing number of GE curricula and related 
supports have been developed, which are aimed at preparing students to 
survive and thrive in an increasingly interconnected and inter-dependent 
world. 

This paper provides an overview of opportunities for teaching GE 
across Canada. A review of social studies curricula across the ten 
provinces and three territories reveals broad and increasing support for 
many of the skills, themes and issues associated with GE. NGOs and the 
Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), also offer curricular 
and other educational materials such as resource guides, presentations, 
speakers, etc. for educators who wish to integrate their curriculum with a 
global perspective. However, despite the existence of curriculum 
outcomes related to GE and support materials, there are still constraints 
and challenges facing global educators. This paper, drawing on the results 



32 






THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR THE SOCIAL 
STUDIES ANNUAL CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



Volume 
2009, 
Issue 1 



of a study of Ontario social studies teachers implementing a global 
citizenship education (GCE) teaching resource, reveals that there are still a 
number of limitations and barriers facing global educators. 



Global Education: Defining the Field 

Global education has a history dating back to the late 1970s. 
Hanvey (1976) was one of the first scholars to provide a comprehensive 
definition of the concept ‘global awareness’. Following Hanvey, a number 
of writers have continued to summarize the key dimensions and themes of 
global education. Case (1999), for example, has identified two inter- 
related dimensions of a global perspective: substantive and perceptual. 
Despite claims that there are certain key concepts or dimensions that are 
widely agreed upon, definitions of GE and global citizenship education 
have also been hotly debated in the research literature for many decades. 
Similar arguments have been made about the contested and complex 
nature of GCE. However, most would agree that GCE involves a more 
critical approach to GE, in order to promote an active model of citizenship 
that emphasizes social justice within a global dimension. 

Global Education in Canada 

A close look at provincial and territorial curricula reveals broad 
and increasing support for many of the skills, themes and issues associated 
with GE and GCE. Across Canada there are references to (and 
connections between) skills and dispositions such as critical thinking; 



33

THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR THE SOCIAL 
STUDIES ANNUAL CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



concepts such as global interdependence and active citizenship; and global 
issues such as human rights and environmental sustainability. In most 
provinces and territories, content, values and skills associated with GE are 
located within the social studies curriculum. 

There is a range of grades where GE is situated across the 
provincial and territorial elementary education systems. Some provinces 
introduce global themes into the earlier grade levels and others in grade 6. 
Some of the central goals and concepts related to GE in the elementary 
curriculum include: citizenship, global interdependence/ interconnections; 
systems worldview; equity/social justice; respect for diversity; human 
rights; multiple perspectives; environmental stewardship; social action; 
and economic competitiveness. 

GE and GCE themes, concepts, and skills are also present in the 
secondary school curriculum. Many of the social studies secondary 
curricula contain overall strands, expectations, or outcomes related to GE. 
A number of provinces have compulsory civics/citizenship education 
courses that make reference to citizenship at the global level. Courses at 
the senior secondary school level in Global/World Issues have been 
popular since the 1990s with an emphasis on understanding a variety of 
world issues from multiple perspectives, and their effects and 
implications. As well, some provinces have senior high-school courses in 
World History/Geography. Alberta stands out for the degree to which 
global perspectives are explicitly infused across the secondary social 
studies curriculum.

In addition to the formal curricula, there are other supports available 
for global educators. There are a number of organizations and agencies 
that have developed GE curriculum materials for educators. Some of these 
include: UNICEF Canada and CIDA, which financially supports projects 
that develop and deliver school -based, GE resources and activities. 

Active Citizens Today (ACT!) 

The ACT! project was motivated by the need for instructional 
materials for grade 6 social studies teachers. Together individuals from 
the Thames Valley District School Board, the UWO Faculty of Education 
and the non-govemmental organization. Free the Children, conceptualized, 
wrote and edited the ACT! Active Citizens Today: Global Education for 
Local Schools teaching kit. The resource provides educators with over 40 
ready-made lesson plans, black line masters, and assessment tasks. 

Research Methodology and Findings 

The 13 teachers who piloted the ACT! teaching kit participated in 
this study. They completed a pre and post-survey about GE and their 
involvement in the study. Researchers also visited classrooms to observe 
ACT! lessons, which were followed by semi-structured interviews. 
Participants attended a debriefing session to share their feedback about the 
challenges and successes they encountered in their GE teaching 

This study found that despite the existence of GE curricular 
expectations and outcomes, and the availability of related teaching 



35

THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR THE SOCIAL 
STUDIES ANNUAL CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



resources and other curricular supports, global educators still face a 
number of barriers and constraints. These include their own lack of 
knowledge about and confidence to teach global issues; lack of support 
from school administrators and parents; the absence of specific GE 
curriculum expectations; and the lack of related accessible curricular 
materials and professional development opportunities. However, it is 
important to note, that these are the teachers’ perceptions about the 
constraints they face and that there is much room in the social studies 
curriculum to integrate GE and support materials for doing so than many 
teachers may be aware of. 

Implications of these findings for the teaching of GE in an 
increasingly globalized world are reviewed in the final section of the paper 
with reference to related research literature. I also discuss the importance 
of attending to the broader school and societal contexts within which 
global educators work and the significance of this for future GE and GCE 
research.

Thematic World History: A Defense and Field Report 

Christopher Dean Lee 

Zephyrhills High School 

With the state-level push toward standardized subject tests and end 
of course exams, the possibility of teaching high school World History — 
or any high school history course — in a thematic fashion grows dim. 
Nevertheless, countervailing trends continue to blow across the landscape 
in defense of thematic World History. First, as a result of trends in 
undergraduate survey courses. College Board appears to be moving 
toward a thematic approach in all three of their Advanced Placement 
history courses. When this takes concrete form, a move will begin (is 
already beginning?) to align high school curriculum to this pedagogical 
model. Second, instant information permeates students’ world and thus 
affects their epistemology. As a result, the need to stress content must take 
a backseat to the teaching of skills and their application in content-specific 
areas. A theme-based approach to World History necessarily focuses on 
critical and analytical thinking skills, not on rote memorization or fact 
fetishism. History teachers must be strongly encouraged to approach 
history in a non-linear, theme-based fashion after the basics of a course 
timeline have been established at the beginning of the semester. 

First year results from the field are promising but not conclusive. 
Students engage the themes more readily than, for example, regions, 
empire, or leaders. They read widely about the theme under discussion and

STUDIES ANNUAL CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS

apply, in writing, their knowledge of the theme to a specific set of 
historical circumstances and questions. Instead of a historically de- 
contextualized inquiry, students ask better and deeper questions about the 
themes, thus leading to greater insights into the specifics of the eras and 
regions under discussion. 

In the end, thematic World History may very well provide one part 
of the answer to the question, “How do we engage century learners?”

Utilizing a Personality Template in Differentiating Potential Teaching 
Styles of Pre-Service Teachers 

Sean M. Lennon 

Valdosta State University 

Jeff Byford 

University of Memphis 

The concept of the study was to see if there exists any difference of 
personalities from students in two different classes; one a sophomore level 
foundations class and the other a senior social studies methods class. The 
foundations class was comprised of 28 students of all education majors. 
The upper level class had 29 students who were middle grades education 
majors only. A survey was given to both classes as part of a learning 
model discussing the two different (primary) teaching styles; that of either 
directive or inquiry based instruction, or somewhere in between. The 
instrument was built from the Five Factor Model (FFM), a commonly used 
personality template considered as one of the most effective tools in 
psychology today. The model was incorporated into previous surveys 
designed to differentiate personality with educational traits. This latest 
incorporation was designed to see if inference can be drawn from 
personality types towards teaching styles and to see if difference occurs in 
the levels of education experience and/or majors. 

The methodology of the study was of a multi-variant design 
utilizing both inferential and descriptive statistics. Each component or 
domain of the FFM would be ascertained using three to four Likert scaled 



40

STUDIES ANNUAL CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



Volume

Issue 1 



questions designed around already established sub-traits. In each domain, 
following the personality questions is a separate education related question 
utilizing a ten point scale. These particular questions, referred to as a 
‘focus’ questions (1-5) would illustrate an educational related scenario or 
issue that mirrors the particular FFM domain. The rational was to allow 
for more variance and to see (hopefully) if any similarities in scale could 
be determined. In ah, the researchers conducted three tests of correlation 
between the two sample groups; testing correlation of the focus questions 
using a Pearson r test, descriptive analysis of the individual questions as 
delineated by directive and inquiry response and a descriptive analysis of 
the questions as compared to student responses towards the focus 
questions. 

Resulting data gleaned student responses illustrated no correlation 
from the sophomores and the seniors towards each of the five education 
related focus questions. One showed slight, positive correlation (r = 0.30) 
using the r scale but was still tested as insignificant. The responses broken 
down by either directive or inquiry heavy teaching styles also indicated a 
difference in response rate though determining any causal reasons or 
themes appeared beyond the reach of this limited study. Perhaps the most 
interesting data was determined through comparison of responses between 
a domain question and the corresponding focus question. These illustrated 
a minute shift in scaled perceptions of the two groups possibly indicating 
changes and/or differences among them. More research is definitely 
suggested before further analysis of this data can be adequately attempted.

however, as this study is too limited in size and sample to draw any 
conclusions. 

As a conclusion the researchers (apparently) have determined that 
differences in personality as seen in students separated by collegiate 
classes and majors which can be illustrated and hopefully, in the future 
can be measured in some statistically viable way. The results appear to 
indicate that difference is established though reasons for this may be an 
outcome (or result) of the classes and/or experience or it may indicate that 
different personality types of students tend to choose different education 
paths. The research also illustrates the instrument as being effective 
though what revisions are still needed and/or the amount of necessary 
testing remaining to establish validity and reliability is still unclear. More 
research is definitely needed and recommended but it appears from this 
limited study that personality, at least the perception of it, is different 
among separate education majors and years of education. The reasons for 
this, however, is still unknown, at this present time

Who’s Responsible for Citizenship Education? 

Views from Pre-service Educators 

Leisa A. Martin 

University of Akron 

Citizenship preparation is recognized as a main goal of education 
(Center for Civic Education, 1994). In their framework for student 
learning, the Partnership for 2E' Century Skills (2004) listed civic literacy 
as a 2E' century theme. In addition, the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 
(U.S. Dept, of Education, 2001) is pervasive, and it requires schools to 
develop responsibility and civic competence. 

Definitions of citizenship may vary, but for the purposes of this 
study, I relied on the National Council for the Social Studies definition of 
citizenship which stated that democratic citizenship is “the ability to make 
informed and reasoned decisions for the public good as citizens of a 
culturally diverse, democratic society in an interdependent world” 
(National Council for the Social Studies, n.d.). However, some individuals 
believe that only social studies teachers are required to prepare students 
for citizenship. To further examine this viewpoint, this study examined 
pre-service teacher education students from various content areas (math, 
English, science, and social studies) and their perceptions on the 
importance / lack of importance that citizenship preparation should play in 
their content area. The theoretical framework for the study was the 
Cognitive Strategy Use model applied to civic activity; this model 
suggested that individuals benefit from having knowledge about how to do 



43

a task, seeing the relevance of the task, and being motivated to do the task 
(Martin, 2005; Martin, 2008). 

Previous research examined perceptions about citizenship using 
various age groups (Anderson, Avery, Pederson, Smith, & Sullivan, 1997; 
Boyle-Baise, 2003; Doppen, Misco, & Patterson, 2008; Fernandez, 2005; 
Kickbusch, 1987; Martin, 2008; Mathews & Dilworth, 2008; National 
Association of Secretaries of State, 1999; Prior, 1999). However, these 
studies did not specifically compare perceptions of citizenship by different 
content majors. Using a case study approach, the primary investigator 
asked pre-service teacher education students the following questions: Do 
you believe that citizenship preparation should or should not be a goal of 
math/English/science/social studies education? Do you see your role as a 
math/English/science/social studies teacher to prepare students for 
citizenship, or do you not see citizenship preparation as your role? 
Knowing how students from different content areas view citizenship 
preparation can be used to improve civic education in the schools. 

To examine views about citizenship preparation, the primary 
investigator designed a mixed methodology case study with four separate 
cases of teacher education candidates from science education, math 
education, English education, and social studies education. Each case 
included 13 to 22 participants from a variety of races. Using a case study 
methodology, the participants and their teachers were interviewed. The 
results indicated a pervasive view that citizenship preparation is a 
responsibility of all majors. Pre-service science education majors 



44 






THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR THE SOCIAL 
STUDIES ANNUAL CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



Volume 
2009, 
Issue 1 



emphasized helping students to develop scientific literacy to solve 
problems and impact society. Pre-service math and pre-service English 
education majors sought to teach citizenship preparation by teaching 
values. Lastly, pre-service social studies education majors saw citizenship 
preparation as a central focus of their teaching as well as a focus for all 
content areas. This study highlights the opportunity for various content 
areas to expand the role of citizenship preparation. While some 
participants opposed citizenship preparation and emphasized a need to 
focus only on content, content can be used to support citizenship 
preparation along with their content area’s organization’s national goals. 
Citizenship preparation can help to bridge this gap using an 
interdisciplinary or non-interdisciplinary approach to show how subject 
area issues and citizenship preparation can be used teach content and take 
action on domestic/intemational topics like social justice.

SHOW & TELL: 

Choosing Appropriate Scaffolding Techniques to Make Social Studies 

Concepts Comprehensible to English Language Learners 

Joyce Nutta 
Carine Strebel Halpern 

University of Central Florida 

Textbook and internet resources, as well as activities based on 
discussions, projects, and reenactments allow Social Studies teachers to 
immerse their students in the content. Given the language intensive nature 
of the discipline, however, English language learners (ELLs) who do not 
yet possess strong English skills struggle to understand fundamental 
aspects of Social Studies concepts, leaving them unable to connect the 
content to and build upon preexisting knowledge. Alternately, many 
teachers are not sufficiently equipped to work with EEEs, either because 
they did not receive coursework in English as a Second Eanguage (ESOE) 
as part of the initial education program, or because the in-service ESOE 
training they attend does not fulfill their needs in teaching this population 
(Clair, 1995; Harper & DeJong, 2004). To teach complex concepts and to 
help develop the academic language skills necessary to succeed in Social 
Studies, these teachers oftentimes struggle to find the appropriate 
modifications for their EEEs. 

The purpose of our presentation is to introduce you to a feasible 
and effective novel approach on how to make subject matter content 
accessible to EEEs. SHOW & TEEE is a research-based approach that

STUDIES ANNUAL CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS

assists teachers in understanding and selecting effective communication 
strategies geared toward the level of English proficiency of the ELLs in 
the class while meeting the needs of native speakers. 

As teacher educators in the field of second language acquisition, 
we view successful classroom instruction as effective communication. 
When we ask our students how they communicate with friends, family, 
students, or parents, their first answer is typically that it happens through 
verbal means, represented by written and spoken language. It is only on 
second thought do they consider that in our daily interactions with others 
we use a lot of non-verbal communication in form of gestures, facial 
expressions, pictures, or graphics. The same two ways of communication 
apply to classroom discourse. Verbal communication in the classroom 
means that you or the text TEEEs the students something. In a non-verbal 
communication instance the information is conveyed through SHOWing. 
Therefore, when you think about designing or adapting a lesson or want to 
incorporate a text into your lesson, you should first consider if the 
information is given by verbal or by non-verbal means. Once this 
determination is made, you can think about scaffolding your instruction to 
the needs of your EEEs through the use of appropriate strategies. 

What makes an instructional strategy an ESOL strategy? 

There’s a popular saying heard in educational settings; ESOL 
strategies are just good teaching. This is partly true. Some instructional 
strategies are as beneficial for native speakers of English as they are for 



49 






Volume 
2009,

THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR THE SOCIAL 
STUDIES ANNUAL CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



ELLs. For example, hands-on experiences facilitate conceptual learning 
for all students as well as comprehensibility for ELLs. However, all 
instructional strategies do not translate into good teaching strategies for 
ELLs, and conversely all good teaching strategies for ELLs may not be 
beneficial for native speakers. For example, cooperative grouping only 
works for ELLs when we consider what functions or tasks the ELLs are 
expected to perform within the group. Simply sitting there and listening to 
the other students deliberate and problem-solve neither helps the ELLs 
comprehend the concepts nor does it help them develop English language 
skills. 

One type of instructional strategy for ELLs does benefit all 
students, namely those that use non-verbal means for communicating 
information. We call this non-verbal means of communication SHOW 
strategies. So, as you are thinking about non-verbal strategies, think of it 
as making the presentation of the material clearer through the 
incorporation of clip art, drawing, or showing how to perform a task 
through a demonstration. You are enhancing the non-verbal aspects. 

The other type of instructional strategy does not benefit all students 
because it is sensitive to ELLs’ level of English proficiency. We call these 
types of strategies TELL strategies since they focus on verbal 
communication, or language, as the means of conveying information. As 
you consider the verbal portions of your lesson, think of making 
adjustments in the use of language (written or spoken) that provides the 
degrees of support your ELLs need. Strategies in this category include

simplified text, highlighted portions of important vocabulary, and 
glossaries, for example. You can also find out if your ELLs understand the 
content through leveled comprehension checks in which low proficiency 
level students would be asked to point to pictures or give one-word 
responses; more advanced ELLs could give more complete answers, but in 
a form that does not require them to use complicated forms of English 
such as conditional. 

Benefits of connecting: SHOW & TELL 

While SHOW and TELL strategies help convey the content of your 
lesson, which is most likely your first concern, they also assist in 
preventing potential breakdowns in communication and when they do 
occur, they help repair this communication barrier. At the same time, 
SHOW and TELL strategies help your students develop the academic 
language needed in your content area. 

How do you incorporate SHOW strategies into mainstream Social Studies 
classrooms ? 

Most teachers long ago discovered the benefits of graphs, pictures, 
or hands-on activities. These are not new, but they take on additional 
importance when thinking about supporting ELLs with the right type of 
non-verbal (SHOW) strategies.

How do you provide TELL strategies in mainstream Social Studies 
classes? 

TELL strategies may require a little bit more planning on your 
part, but the time you save during the lesson by nipping potential 
communication break-downs in the bud are well worth it. Enlisting the 
assistance of bilingual aides, ESOL resource teachers, and parent 
volunteers in preparing TELL strategies for use during your lesson, as a 
supplement to your lesson, or as an alternative to your lesson is an 
efficient way to balance the various needs in your diverse classroom. 

Teachers considerate of ESOL needs ensure that their English 
language learners don’t LOSE. Through systematic application of both 
non-verbal (SHOW) and verbal (TELL) strategies. Social Studies teachers 
can engage ELLs and build their language proficiency in the process.

Integrating Technology into Teaching Social Studies Methods Course: 

A Classroom Example 

James Oigara 

Canisius College 

Using technology to enhance student learning in social studies has 
become an important area for discussion and study within the field of 
social studies. This paper describes how a social studies methods professor 
integrated diverse tools of technologies into teaching social studies 
education methods course. The integration that continued for two 
semesters involved a series of technology related projects for students to 
complete and the professor’s modeling the course for technology use to 
facilitate learning. This paper describes the projects for technology 
integration and course modeling. The paper also reports on the impact of 
technology integration in the methods course. The course lectures were 
designed to model the use of diverse technologies in a verity of settings 
that engaged prospective social studies teachers in ways that increased 
their desire to use technology in meaningful ways in their classroom 
teaching. Prospective teachers in the course worked in small groups to 
create projects, activities or lessons for their social studies classrooms that 
integrated technology to enhance student learning. The pre-service 
teachers were introduced to different tools of technologies including 
SMART Board, clickers, online resources (Web sites), Microsoft software 
(excel, PowerPoint) audio visual resources, Web Quests, photography, and 
data analysis techniques. The instructor also assisted the preservice

teachers in learning the basic skills needed to operate different tools of 
technology and their integration into lessons by demonstrating different 
ways the tools could be used to have a positive impact on student learning. 
In addition, throughout the semester the instructor held tutoring sessions 
(on Saturdays) for students who needed more guidance using SMART 
board technology to create classroom activities. Data was collected from 
surveys, observations, analysis of students’ coursework, analysis of lesson 
plans ideas, a personal journal, a record of technology used during each 
class session, and one-on-one interview. The pre-service teachers taking 
the course reported that the modeling and integration of diverse tools of 
technologies encouraged them to incorporate technology into their 
teaching. Evidences in students’ coursework, course projects, discussions, 
lesson plans and classroom teaching supported their statements and the 
research findings. Some findings suggested that good modeling of the 
methods course does impact pre-service teachers’ views of and uses of 
technology tools in their lessons.

You Tube as a Learning Tool 

Russell Owens 

King ’s College 

Barbara Fralinger 

Rowan University 

This paper expands upon previous researeh eondueted on the 
effeetiveness of implementing Mierosoft MovieMaker (a digital video 
editing program) into the elassroom. Sixty-one graduate and twenty 
undergraduate students from King's College and Rowan University took 
part in this study. Using the MovieMaker software to design student 
ereated tutorials on material learned in elass, participants uploaded 
finished movie tutorials to the Internet -based website "You Tube" with the 
goal of providing classmates with a distance education learning program. 
With the ability to create and upload coursework using graphics and 
animation, new opportunities exist for teachers and trainers to expand their 
teaching methodologies while catering to a variety of learning styles. The 
purpose of this study was to investigate student perceptions of the 
effectiveness of the You Tube tutorial project on their learning so that a 
future educational workshop to teach the basics of creating and uploading 
student video tutorials may be implemented. A survey containing both 
quantitative and qualitative components was administered at the 
completion of the You Tube project to assess student perceptions of this 
teaching strategy. Quantitative analysis involved the use of frequencies

and descriptive statistics, while qualitative analysis consisted of grouping 
open-ended responses into the following themes: 1. Application of You 
Tube; 2. Major Strengths of the You Tube Project in the Learning Process; 
3. Instructor Effectiveness in the Learning Process; and 4. Suggestions for 
Improvement to Enhance Learning. Results showed that the You Tube 
tutorial methodology had a significant positive effect on perceived student 
learning.

A Case for Infusing Content on Students with Disabilities into Social 
Studies Teacher Preparation Programs 

Kimberly Pawling 

University of Central Florida 



The presentation will discuss some of the recent literature on 
beginning teacher standards since No Child Left Behind (NCLB) and the 
2004 Individuals with Disabilities Improvement Act (IDEIA). Beginning 
teacher standards for both general and special education have changed 
since NCLB. Changes have been made because the Interstate New 
Teacher Assessment and Support Consortium (INTASC) in conjunction 
with the Office for Special Education Programs (OSEP) at the federal 
Department of Education realized that teacher preparation programs were 
graduating students who were not adequately prepared to teach the diverse 
population of students that exist in many schools. The presentation will 
include the list of 10 essential knowledge and skills identified as necessary 
skills that beginning teachers must demonstrate prior to graduation. 

After reading the research, the presenter decided to interview 
students enrolled in the secondary social studies methods courses at her 
university, regarding their knowledge about students with disabilities and 
possible classroom and assessment accommodations. The presentation 
with include the qualitative analysis of the data as well as implications for 
additional research needs in the area of social studies teacher preparation 
programs infusing content regarding students with disabilities.

Universal Design for Learning in the Social Studies Classroom 

Kimberly Pawling 

University of Central Florida 

The presentation will describe the basic concepts involved in 
planning classroom instruction for all students, Universal Design for 
Learning (UDL). The presenter will review some recent findings related to 
the brain and learning, as well as, the 3 elements of UDL: multiple means 
of representation of material, multiple means for expression of material, 
and multiple means for engagement with materials. Participants will also 
be shown some examples of planning and assessing students with diverse 
needs in one classroom by applying the concepts UDL. Finally, the 
presenter will share some free internet accessible websites and software 
that can facilitate planning and implementation of UDL in the classroom, 
particularly, the Center for Applied Special Technology (CAST). 

The CAST website provides free materials, assessment tools, 
examples, videos, etc. focused on assisting teachers and instructional 
leaders in creating classroom content and environments that are designed 
for all learners. Planning with UDL in mind is not the same as planning 
for accommodations for students with exceptional needs; rather, planning 
using UDL, eliminates the necessity to accommodate different learning 
styles, because instruction for ALL students is designed so that ALL 
students are provided with the same content and same 'accommodations'.

Thinking Critically or Thinking Historically: 

Which Ohjective do we choose in Secondary History Classrooms? 

Anthony Pellegrino 

Valdosta State University 

In a research study conducted in three public high schools in the 
United States, the presenter examined whether or not engaging students in 
lessons associated with historical thinking had an effect on non-content 
related critical thinking skills. Pre and posttests were given to over 120 
students to measure general critical thinking skills. During the school year 
students completed twelve intensive lesson modules designed to allow 
students to think historically. Additionally, interviews were conducted to 
discern whether such engagement influenced meta-cognitive processes of 
the students. The objective overall was to discover whether engagement in 
historical thinking had any effect on more general critical thinking and 
meta-cognitive processes of the students involved. This study contributes 
to the growing field of historical thinking, demonstrating the complexities 
of thinking skills and the transferability of specific content area thinking 
skills to other disciplines. The intent of the proposed presentation is to 
present the findings of this study.

Got History? An Examination of Attitudes, Content Knowledge, and 
Perceptions Related to Historical Fiction in a Children’s Literature 

Pre-service Course 



Sherron Killingsworth Roberts 
Vicky Zygouris-Coe 

University of Central Florida 

Patricia Crawford 

University of Pittsburgh 

Too often, history is presented to children as a series of chapters, 
disparate events, or isolated happenings long ago that have little relevance 
to their present experiences in life or learning. This is unfortunate, since 
under the best circumstances, the study of history is a rich means of not 
only understanding days gone by, but of transforming our capacity to 
better comprehend our personal and collective lives now (Schur, 2007; 
Tunnell & Ammon, 1993). In an effort to capture preservice teachers’ 
notions regarding historical fiction, surveys were distributed before, 
during, and after interactions with historical fiction. Throughout the 
semester, several chapter books (See Figure 1) were read collaboratively 
by the class integrated with pedagogical strategies for historical fiction, 
such as text sets (Hamman, 1995; Opitz, 1998), readers theater, jackdaws 
(Dodd, 1999), decade posters, Timeliner software projects, and museum 
collections. In addition, respondents participated in literature circles 
(Daniels, 2002) using exclusively historical fiction chapter books for 
children as well as related time period inquiry groups. 



61

Historical fiction books do not merely hold a collection of 
historical facts within their pages. Books in this genre weave historical 
authenticity within a compelling storyline that usually includes the unique 
perspective of a child protagonist, a contextualized historical setting, and a 
sense of emotional pull (Crawford & Zygouris-Coe, 2008). Karen 
Cushman, Newbery Medal winner, notes: "Without historical accuracy, 
my books would be fantasy. With only historical accuracy, they would be 
textbooks. For historical fiction, there must be a story, accurate in detail 
but brought to life through imagination and creativity.” (in Temple, 
Martinez, Yokota, & Naylor, 1998, p. 326). Quality historical fiction can 
often draw even reluctant readers into the context by providing visual and 
other sensory clues about daily life in the time period presented 
(Zamowski, 2006). Not only is historical fiction about the past, it helps 
readers develop a critical understanding of complex social issues and age- 
old dilemmas against the template of today’s challenges so as to better 
understand ourselves in today’s context. "Historical fiction helps bridge 
the gap between the past and the present for young readers" (Sipe, 1997, p. 
254). 

By implementing successful strategies for engaging young readers 
with historical fiction with these teachers, respondents noted that historical 
fiction would not have been their first choice to read before this semester- 
long experience. During the semester, the professor worked to create an 
atmosphere that stimulated students to learn about an historical era, to 
“think historically,” and to develop a sense of social responsibility based

STUDIES ANNUAL CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



Volume

on historical fiction. By offering historical fiction selections in a variety of 
formats, such as poetry, picture books, and chapter books and relying 
heavily on pedagogical discourse with emphasis on allowing personal 
connections as well as illuminating the social justice issues of the time 
period li nk ed with today’s social issues, the model of thinking historically 
was demonstrated with each book the class collaboratively read. 

Patterns were culled from pre, during, and post survey responses 
centered on participants’ attitudes, content knowledge, and perceptions 
regarding historical fiction as a content area of knowledge and as a 
teaching tool for the classroom. Even though the majority of participants 
did not read historical fiction either growing up or at present, all 
participants reported positively in regard to history and historical fiction as 
a genre and a pedagogical tool. While none of the participants reported 
that they would have chosen their historical fiction literature circle book 
on their own, all respondents reported being happy with their choice 
during the midpoint survey and respondents were intrigued with the life 
connections that could be made to characters living in another century. 
Each group reported that collaborative reading helped them with concepts 
and stimulated questions for further inquiry. The respondents now found 
historical fiction interesting as an avenue for further study. 

By the end of the semester, all of the individual respondents 
reported significant gains in their knowledge of the historical period in 
which their literature circle books were set. Whether participants moved 
from weak to average or strong, or from average to strong, all reported 



63 






Volume

Issue 1 



THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR THE SOCIAL 
STUDIES ANNUAL CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



gains in content knowledge as a result of this experience. Not only that, 
but participants were able to make personal connections and to verify the 
authenticity of factual information within the pages of the historical fiction 
books they read. A representative quote from the post-surveys noted: 
These pieces really brought the time periods alive. Out of the Dust was 
written in a way that you could actually taste the mud in your mouth. I 
never realized how truly awful it was for people during the Dust Bowl. 
Others reported that details about transportation, clothes, culture, mores, 
and the etiquette of the day stood out for them as they read the books. 

A representative sample of responses from the post-survey noted 
that the best thing about being exposed to historical fiction this semester 
included these comments: 

-I would never have picked up any of those books on my own, but 
now I would definitely use any of them to teach in my classroom. I am 
especially anxious (excited) to read Catherine Called Birdy . 

-I was introduced to time periods that I was not very familiar with- 
ex. 13th century England. 

-I grew an appreciation I didn 't have before. 

And, when asked what was the worst thing about being exposed to 
historical fiction throughout the semester, participants made these 
representative comments: 

-Nothing- it's one of my favorite genres now! 

-For me, it might be difficult to choose which books and which 
eras would be interesting to me. 



64

-I LOVE it and want to read more. ..when I should be studying! 

When the post-surveys posited this question: “ Do you intend to 
incorporate historical fiction in your future classrooms?”, the following 
sample of comments show the results of a semester of considering 
historical fiction: 

-Yes, I think it is a great way to introduce or incorporate history 
in a fun way. 

-Yes, Great way to introduce and tie together literature and social 

studies. 

In fact, despite no direct instruction on infusing historical fiction 
into social studies content, all participants intended to use this knowledge 
in their future classrooms after participating in collaborative reading, 
literature circle groups, inquiry groups, and in strategies to engage readers 
in historical fiction. As the comments from the pre-, midpoint, and post- 
surveys were synthesized for patterns, this Winston Churchill quote came 
to mind: “Personally, I am always ready to learn, although I do not always 
like being taught.” (Retrieved on February 26, 2009 from 

http://www.brainvquote.eom/quotes/quotes/w/winstonchul00128.html) . 
These prospective teachers would not have chosen to read historical 
fiction on their own or to consider the related content and pedagogy. 
However, given the opportunity to transact with books and engage in 
inquiries with a supportive community of learners, they discovered that 
they were indeed not only ready to learn in meaningful ways, but also to 
find pleasure in that learning. Learning experiences that pair history and

literature such as these, no doubt, can provide a helpful scaffold of support 

and intrinsic motivation for educators and their future students.

Enhancing History Instruction with Online Auctions 

Kirk Rohinson 
Scott M. Waring 

University of Central Florida 

Teaching history from multiple perspectives with primary sources 
is vitally important when attempting to engage students in historical 
inquiry and historical thinking (Barton & Levstik, 2001; Johnson, 2007; 
McCormick, 2004). A great way to obtain primary sources with multiple 
historical perspectives, as well as other historical artifacts, is through 
online auctions. For this project, we purchased several World War II era 
news magazines from the online auction vendor eBay. The total cost of the 
magazines was less than thirty ($30) dollars and our purchases consisted 
of a March 9, 1942 edition of Life magazine, a March 16, 1942 edition of 
Newsweek magazine, and a March 23, 1942 edition of Time magazine. 

To help students gain insight as to how the United States home 
front reacted to World War II during March 1942, we will have them 
analyze the content of these magazines. Students will assemble into 
groups of three and each group will be assigned a magazine to examine. 
The groups will search for stories related to the war effort on the home 
front. Each group will become “experts” on the coverage of their 
respective magazine’s home front news stories and the content of those 
stories. The groups will then share their expertise with the class. 

By having students examine and share their findings from the three 
different news magazines with three varying perspectives, they will have

Utilizing Film to Teach Social Issues 

William B. Russell III 

University of Central Florida 

Utilizing film to teach social issues is a powerful and authentic 
form of instruction. The practice of teaching social issues is often regarded 
as a best practice. However, teaching social issues is often a practice that 
teachers tend not to utilize. Typically, teachers shy away from social 
issues because social issues are controversial in nature. Although 
controversial, the teaching of social issues is a powerful and effective 
method of instruction. 

The method of teaching with film is also considered a best practice 
and many consider teaching with film to be an effective strategy (Holmes 
et al, 2007; Paris 1997; Russell & Waring, 2007; Russell, 2007 & 2008; & 
Stoddard & Marcus, 2006). Film can help students develop a better 
understanding of the content by providing visual images. In addition, Matz 
& Pingatore (2005) explain that film can bring students closer to a topic 
they are studying. 

Teaching social issues with film can be an effective teaching tool 
in the classroom. Examining controversial social issues via film can help 
students learn to deal with conflict and take on life’s leadership roles 
(Soley, 1996), and may teach students to clarify and justify their opinions 
on a number of issues. In today’s society, students are often unable to 
justify their own opinions and debate various issues with rational

STUDIES ANNUAL CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS

Issue 1 



reasoning. When dealing with political and social issues students typically 
accept their parents and/or close relatives’ opinions and views as their 
own, without giving any real thought to the issues at hand (Russell, 2004). 

Together, teaching social issues with film can provide a 
meaningful learning experience that can help students clarify stances on 
various social issues, increase student interest in the content, and promote 
critical thinking and decision making s ki lls.

Images of the Holocaust: Using Holocaust Art to Promote Higher 

Order Thinking Skills 

William B. Russell HI 
Stewart Waters 

University of Central Florida 

Art is a noble mission. Those who have been chosen by 
destiny to reveal the soul of a people, to let it speak in stone 
or ring in sounds, live under a powerful, almighty, and all- 
pervading force. They will speak a language, regardless of 
whether others understand them. They will suffer hardship 
rather than become unfaithful to the star which guides them 
from within - Adolf Hitler, Nuremburg Speech, 1935. 

The above quote by Adolf Hitler addressing the importance and 
nobility of art is a testament to its pervasive power in history. In fact, 
Adolf Hitler, one of the most infamous figures throughout history, was in 
fact an artist. Hitler began painting as a child and originally planned to 
attend art school in Vienna. After he was rejected from this art school. 
Hitler began to explore other avenues to make a living, but he did not stop 
referring to himself as an artist until 1920 (Price, Unknown). It is 
interesting to examine Hitler’s love/hate relationship with art throughout 
the Holocaust. While Hitler certainly appreciated art, he banned all forms 
of Jewish art from German society and outlawed the creation of artwork in 
the ghettos and concentration camps. Any prisoners discovered creating

STUDIES ANNUAL CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



artwork in ghettos or concentration camps could face immediate 
execution. However, despite the danger they faced, many heroic people in 
ghettos and concentration camps created works of art as a form of 
resistance. Some people created artwork to document what was happening 
in the camps, making them a great primary resource, while others created 
pieces of art to free their mind from the harsh reality of daily life in the 
ghettos or concentration camps. 

Teaching about the Holocaust is one of the most popular topics or 
themes to explore for students and teachers. In fact, some states have 
mandated the instruction of Holocaust education in public schools 
(Russell, 2005). Being such a popular topic in the curriculum, there is 
certainly no shortage of resources available for teachers to create lessons 
in the classroom. The purpose of this presentation is to provide teachers 
with resources and a different perspective on teaching the Holocaust. 



Why Use Art To Teach The Holocaust? 

There is significant research that proves incorporating art into 
classroom instruction is effective. According to Stone (2002) integrating 
art into a classroom is a best practice of award winning teachers. Fogarty 
(1997) explains how artwork provides students with an emotional 
connection to the content, and research indicates that emotions are the 
keys that unlock the mind. An emotional connection to the content begin 
study helps student personalize the information, which can lead to more 
meaningful learning and longer retention. As Driscoll (2000) explains.

“Meaningful learning will then enable the information to move from the 
short-term memory to the long-term memory.” By using Holocaust 
artwork, students have the opportunity to explore the historical content 
while also making an emotional connection to the experiences and feelings 
of Holocaust victims. After all, artwork created by Holocaust victims is 
the visual testimony of their horrific experiences during one of the most 
shameful events in the history of mankind. 



Conclusion 

“Using primary sources such as art from the Holocaust, allows 
students to step into the minds and see the Holocaust from the artist 
perspective, the perspective of those who actually were involved in the 
Holocaust. When a student sees the artwork of a Holocaust victim, 
emotions and personal feelings are raised to a level that no lecture, 
textbook, or worksheet could ever reach. By sparking a wide range of 
emotions from anger, shame, regret, disbelief, and compassion students 
internalize the material, which helps develop insight into the conditions 
and events surrounding the Holocaust. At the end of the unit students 
might not remember exact names and dates, but they will remember the 
camps, the people in the camps, the persecutors, and the conditions and 
events that surrounded the Holocaust” (Russell, 2007). In sum, using 
online art from the Holocaust is a meaningful and engaging way to instruct 
students about the atrocities endured in ghettos and concentration camps 
throughout WWII.

Talkin’ the Talk and Walkin’ the Walk: The NCSS Position 
Statements Regarding Controversial Issues Instruction 

Kimberlee Sharp 

Morehead State University 

Results of original research regarding the extent to which NCSS 
adhered to its Position Statements on controversial issues instruction is the 
topic of this presentation. The researcher examined Social Education, 
Social Studies and the Young Learner, and Middle Level Learning 
between the years 1973 and 2003 and conducted a content analysis of the 
3 journals for controversial issues articles. The researcher found that: 1) 
the NCSS views the teaching of controversial issues at every level of a 
student’s education as a necessary component of citizenship education in 
its Position Statements; 2) what actually has been published in NCSS’ 
teacher journals are related more to broad themes than to specific 
controversial issues; and 3) the NCSS was more likely to publish articles 
regarding “hot - button” controversial issues in the 1970’s than in the 
1990’s and 2000’s. These findings led the researcher to conclude that the 
NCSS only moderately supported its Position Statements on the teaching 
of controversial issues during the period investigated.

Cross-Border Education: A Basis for Wider Cross-Cultural 
Communication between Thailand and Cambodia 

Sunida Siwapathomchai 

Mahidol University 

In an age of globalization, the relationships between peoples are 
increasingly complex. Large-scale movements of people across porous 
borders are often associated with ethnic tensions and conflicts while the 
positive impact on local communities is less well recognized. Thailand is a 
key destination for immigrants from neighboring countries. The eastern 
provinces near the Thai-Cambodia border have become a ‘destination of 
choice’ for increasing numbers of legal and illegal Cambodian 
immigrants, bringing with them social, economic and administrative 
problems. A significant problem for Thai authorities is the provision of 
education to the children of these immigrants. This research aims to 
investigate the situation of “cross-border education” of Cambodian 
students in two provinces adjacent to the Thai-Cambodia border - Trat and 
Sakaew. Their motivation for coming to study in Thai schools and the 
attitudes of the Thai people amongst whom these Cambodian students are 
living, is studied through interviews with 55 key informants. The role of 
cross-cultural communication is also analyzed. The research results show, 
not only the burden of educating Cambodian children, but also the benefits 
reaped by their inclusion in the Thai education system. 

In recent years, Cambodian parents have been motivated to send 
their children to study in Thai schools: to have their children learn Thai in

Thai schools because of the better teaching environment offered in 
Thailand and for the benefits it offers for future careers. In addition, Thai- 
speaking Cambodians whose families were Thai before historical border 
ehanges left them on the Cambodian side retain a sense of Thai identity 
and thus seek ways of sending their ehildren to Thai sehools. The situation 
of eross-border edueation reveals the elose ties between the border 
eommunities and suggests an important ehannel of eross-eultural 
oommunieation whieh ean be a means of strengthening the relationship 
between Thais and Cambodians. In contrast to the ongoing problems of 
eultural separation in Southern Thailand, the situation in the East offers a 
more inclusive multicultural atmosphere and reveals a variety of ways of 
belonging to and accepting others into one’s nation, demonstrating that 
border lines often do not eulturally delineate people as elearly as some 
would assume. 

In faet, Thailand and Cambodia have long held strong relations in 
different aspeets, from trade to polities and even eulture. However, some 
people of these two countries, at the national level, still have negative 
attitudes toward each other. Some Thais still have a bias against 
Cambodian migrants. Fortunately, such attitudes do not occur in schools. 
Attitude is an outcome of pereeption and is also the key to the success or 
failure of oommunieation. As oommunieation is a produot of eulture, 
misoommunioation ean ooeur, espeoially when there are signifioant 
eultural differenees between eommunioators. A key faotor generating 
misoommunioation is eultural bias whieh inoludes ethnooentrism.

stereotyping, prejudice, discrimination and racism. To solve such 
problems, cross-border education is a basis for wider cross-cultural 
communication. Children from different ethnic groups and cultures should 
have opportunities to learn together and share their worldviews. It is a 
means of creating awareness of diversity and acceptance among one 
another in order to live together in harmony and peace. 

Moreover, this research affirms the importance of ‘language’ in 
cross-cultural communication. Learning a language is not only for having 
a tool for communicating with others but it is also the key to 
understanding other cultures and worldviews. We can see that Cambodian 
people are very interested in learning other languages especially Thai. In 
contrast, only a few people in Thailand care to learn the languages of 
neighboring countries. In the near future, a new generation of Cambodians 
who will represent an important force for development, will use their 
knowledge of Thai language and culture as a fundamental basis for trade 
and political negotiation. Thais therefore, especially those in the border 
provinces, should also be encouraged to learn Khmer language and culture 
for the benefit of Thailand. ‘Understanding ourselves and knowing others’ 
will help us win in every situation. Thai children should be taught to 
understand and appreciate what they have locally area and to appreciate 
what their neighbors have too. This will form a basis for sustainable local 
development and will finally lead to national development. 

In conclusion ‘cross-border education’ can be considered as ‘a 
social capital’ for Thailand. It offers Thailand many opportunities. The

first one is an opportunity to lessen social problems from Cambodian 
expats. Cambodian students are taught not to commit crimes or create 
other social problems in society. They are also taught about how to take 
care of health and the environment and they can communicate this to their 
parents as well. The second one is to solve conflicts and foster good 
relationships between the people of the two countries. Providing education 
to Cambodian children will make them feel good and possess positive 
attitudes towards Thailand and Thai people. When these children grow up 
and work in other parts of Cambodia, they can act as ‘local ambassadors’ 
who communicate good things about Thailand. The third opportunity is to 
create networks for regional development. As human resource is very 
important, providing an education is a good way to build up ‘social 
capital’ for the region in order to co-operate in wider development. The 
fourth is an opportunity to promote Thai language and culture whereby 
Cambodian students can represent Thailand as ‘cultural ambassadors’. 
The last opportunity is to improve the quality of education to an 
international level. This can be a positive means of revenue derived from 
wealthy Cambodian parents who can afford their children an education in 
Thailand.

Identifying Culturally Responsive Practices in Classrooms Serving 
Haitian and Haitian American Students 

Martha Scott Lue Stewart 
Kevin Meehan 
Rosalyn Howard 

University of Central Florida 

In some parts of the United States, Haitian and Haitian American 
students represent one of the fastest growing groups of students entering 
our classrooms. As our nation's classrooms become more culturally and 
linguistically diverse, the need for culturally responsive teachers, those 
who use the cultural knowledge, prior experiences, and performance styles 
of diverse students to make learning more appropriate and effective for 
them, is becoming even greater. 

Many educators-both teachers and administrators- are faced with 
limited understanding of cultures other than their own and the possibility 
that this limitation will negatively affect their students’ ability to become 
successful learners. Conversely, they may exhibit minimal awareness of 
distinctive "funds of knowledge" students have gained from their home, 
community, and school, and use that knowledge in designing instructional 
activities that are more meaningful to students. “Funds of knowledge” is 
defined as the various social and linguistic practices and the historically 
accumulated bodies of knowledge that are essential to students' homes and 
communities.

Hence, educators must critically assess their relationships with 
their students and their families and an understanding of the racial, 
language, ethnic, and cultural diversities represented. Their perceptions of 
these families, students and cultures may inadvertently impact students 
learning, resilience, and their academic achievement. 

Similarly, 

• Many Haitian and Haitian American students come to the 
classroom with minimal proficiency in English; 

• Further, in Central Florida, as well as in our nation, many 
educators face the daunting task of teaching English Fanguage 
Feamers (EFF) to read English even before they can read in their 
own native language. 

The use of culturally responsive teaching (CRT) recognizes the 
importance of including students' cultural references in all aspects of 
learning. Drawing on quantitative and qualitative data about educational 
experiences of Haitian and Haitian American students in the Central 
Florida region, as well as current studies of CRT best practices, the 
authors present a research model that proposes to examine the degree to 
which teachers of Haitian and Haitian American students incorporate 
practices in their classrooms in order to achieve the highest levels of 
cultural competence among students.

An International Model: 

Preparing Pre- Service Teachers for Cultural Diversity 

Brenda S. Thompson 

University of Central Florida 

Between 1994 and 2000, 40 pre-service teachers from Florida 
A&M (FAMU) embarked upon a 14 week international student teaching 
experience that immersed them into culturally diverse classrooms, 
communities and tourist settings. These culturally enriching experiences 
were uniquely different and valuable. For many pre-service teachers, prior 
experiences in education consisted of exposure to homogeneous groups of 
students, teachers, administrators, parents and paraprofessionals. Settings 
were fa mi liar and may not have been perceived as being culturally diverse. 

Following graduation, the 40 pre-service teachers were tracked. 
Thirty-nine were located and interviewed regarding how the international 
student teaching experience prepared them for cultural diversity. This 
study includes responses to a survey designed to capture respondents’ 
perceptions of the impact of the international student teaching experience 
on their resulting multicultural dispositions and behaviors. 

The vast majority of pre-service teachers who participated in the 
international student teaching program between spring 1994 and spring 
2000 perceived the program as one that assisted them in broadening their 
perspectives about cultures other than their own. Their exposure to diverse 
populations, representing a variety of cultures, assisted them in gaining 
significant knowledge about various groups and in developing sensitive

STUDIES ANNUAL CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS

caring dispositions and appreciations regarding the people and their 
contributions to society. 

The International Student Teaching Program at FAMU was 
designed to promote an awareness of a wide range of school programs and 
provide pre-service teachers an opportunity to bring back to the campus 
and various school districts a host of multicultural experiences that could 
be shared and utilized in everyday professions and personal interactions. 
In this study, participants developed a real sense of independence and 
realize that they could be successful, not just at FAMU, but also in foreign 
lands. They took advantage of the opportunity to travel to European, Asian 
and Caribbean cities to broaden their perspectives regarding cultures other 
than their own. 

As a result of the program, on foreign shores, there is a greater 
awareness of FAMU and its graduates. Some students were employed by 
DoDDS and received full-time international teaching assignments while 
others continued to enlighten students in the classrooms in the United 
States and the Caribbean. Ultimately, the International Student Teaching 
Program helped FAMU’s pre-service teachers become world citizens who 
have acquired teaching skills, values, attitudes and behaviors that support 
understanding and respect for all people and their cultures.

University of North Carolina, Charlotte 

Most social studies classrooms come equipped with at least one 
computer and basic software applications. Often, teachers do not have the 
time to discover all of the possibilities for the basic software on the 
computers within their classroom. In this session, participants will learn 
step by step proeedures on how to utilize software that is highly accessible 
in the regular social studies elassroom. Procedures will be shared for 
using traditional edueational software packages, sueh as Word, 
PowerPoint, and digital movie and photo editing software (i.e. Photoshop, 
Movie Maker, etc.), to enhance the learning environment and experienee. 
K-16 projeets will be shared and learning experienees will be 
demonstrated during the session. Minimal technology skills are needed, as 
this session is for individuals at both the novice and expert levels of 
proficiency. Participants will have an opportunity to learn ways in which 
they can enhance their existing skills for planning with technology and for 
seamlessly integrating technology into the teaehing of soeial studies

U.S. Monuments and Memorials: Incorporating the Art of 
Remembering into the Social Studies Curriculum 

Stewart Waters 

University of Central Florida 

For many secondary social studies teachers, covering all of U.S. 
History in one school year can prove to be a daunting task. In the era of 
high stakes testing, teachers are required to focus on the quantity of 
material covered over the quality. This is especially prevalent in the 
curriculum of world and U.S. history courses in middle and high schools. 
Many American history textbooks begin with Native American cultures 
and end with the world in the 2U* century. With so much to teach in so 
little time, the question for U.S. history teachers is how can we cover all of 
the required material in a meaningful and engaging way that will help 
students build a connection with the past while also promoting critical 
thinking skills? 

One interesting way to cover U.S. history content is to study 
monuments and memorials that have been created over the years. 
Monuments and memorials are visual representations of a society or 
cultures ideals, achievements, religion, and heroes that existed at one point 
in time (Dupre 2007, p. xii). While monuments tend to serve a variety of 
purposes, they do all have one common characteristic. Monuments are 
“intended to last in time and to signify the importance of whatever 
memory they wish to pass on to the future” (Fehl 1972, p. 3). It is the 
interpretation and analysis of monuments that naturally lends itself to 



87 






Volume 
2009, 
Issue 1 



THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR THE SOCIAL 
STUDIES ANNUAL CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



critical thinking activities in secondary classrooms. By incorporating the 
teaching of monuments into the U.S. history curriculum, teachers can 
provide students with the unique opportunity to participate in the historical 
process, as opposed to passively memorizing information from readings or 
lectures. Students can study different monuments throughout the history of 
our nation and begin to build their own interpretation of what it means to 
be an American. Studying monuments and memorials will also help 
students identify important social concepts such as racism, prejudice, 
poverty, and societies, cultures, religions, events, and heroes that are 
memoriali z ed in history. James Percoco discusses the relevance of 
monuments in history curriculum in his book, A Passion for the Past 
(1998). Percoco posits, “it is the allegorical and monumental nature of 
commemorative sculpture that makes it so attractive for use in the 
classroom” (p. 48). Using monuments to teach U.S. history will require 
some research, reading, and planning on the part of the teacher. Acquiring 
the background knowledge necessary to effectively discuss monuments 
may take some extra time, but like many other effective pedagogical 
approaches, the results will prove to be worth the additional effort. 

It is important to note that monuments should be incorporated into 
the curriculum as a teaching tool. Similar to films, textbooks, worksheets, 
or computers, monuments need to be addressed as a way to interpret 
history and gather information about the past. As a resource, monuments 
will encourage students to think critically about historical facts and not 
simply rely on the textbook or Wikipedia as a one-stop spot for all their 



88 






THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR THE SOCIAL 
STUDIES ANNUAL CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



Volume

Issue 1 



answers. Students need to be aware that monuments were designed to 
preserve a cultures history and tell a specific story. The journey for 
students to embark on with monuments in studying U.S. history is 
interpreting their story and validating the truth of the history preserved in 
monuments. Leone Alberti discusses how “no monument... should be 
made except for actions that truly deserve to be perpetuated” (Alberti 
1986, p. 170). Since some monuments in U.S. history were specifically 
created to misinform or exaggerate historical persons/events, students will 
have an opportunity to be responsible consumers of information. This is 
an important skill for students to acquire because they currently are 
surrounded by a constant flow of information. The Internet and other 
media outlets provide students with a plethora of information, most of 
which is taken at face value by the students. Keeping that in mind, it is 
necessary for the 2U' century social studies teacher to structure lessons 
and assignments in a way that will give students the opportunity to build a 
perception of truth using a variety of resources. Studying monuments is 
one of the many great resources available to teachers. Monuments and 
memorials in U.S. history are reflections of the social climate during a 
specific point in time. Teachers should encourage students to identify why 
certain monuments have been created, how the public responded to these 
monuments at that time, and how the public presently responds to the 
monument.

Promoting Global Citizenship by Analyzing Social Issues and Human 
Rights Violations of the WWII Era 

Stewart Waters 
William B. Russell III 

University of Central Florida 

In 1968, Chief Justice Earl Warren delivered a speech at an 
invitational conference convened by the President’s Commission for the 
Observance of Human Rights Year in Washington, D.C. This year was 
designated the Human Rights year by President Johnson in order to 
commemorate the 20* anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights. In this important speech. Chief Justice Warren reminds the 
American people of our role in protecting and promoting human rights at 
home, and abroad. He believed that “in order to understand human rights, 
we must constantly seek to learn more about them and their impact on our 
world...” (Hines and Wood 1969, pg. 1). Chief Justice Warren’s call for 
greater knowledge regarding human rights acted as a manifesto for social 
studies educators in the United States. The National Council for the Social 
Studies (NCSS) responded to this call in 1969 by publishing “A Guide to 
Human Rights.” This handbook highlights the long struggle and evolution 
of human rights, while also offering useful teaching ideas for the 
promotion of human rights. Within this handbook, the authors (Hines and 
Wood) identify WWII as a major turning point in the direction and 
perception of universal human rights. The authors discussed how “the 
stark demonstrations of atrocities brought man to the point where he was 



91 






Volume

THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR THE SOCIAL 
STUDIES ANNUAL CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS 



ready to take giant strides toward the establishment of universal human 
rights” (pg. 20). 

The monumental events that took place during this Era brought 
forth a widespread movement calling for protection of human rights all 
over the globe. Atrocities such as the Holocaust, Nanjing Massacre, and 
Japanese Internment all revealed a universal need to protect the rights of 
all human beings. The aforementioned events constitute extreme examples 
of how legitimate governments can foster, tolerate, and legitimize human 
rights violations in the name of national security. As Smith (1998) writes, 
“The Holocaust, in conjunction with the atrocities committed in Europe 
and Asia during the Second World War, demonstrated the clear need for a 
global standard of human rights” (Smith and McIntosh 1998). It is for this 
reason that educators need to strongly consider using a historical analysis 
of these events to help students gain a better understanding of human 
rights violations, how they occur, and their role as a global citizen. 



Conclusion 

Human rights education in social studies classrooms should not be 
an option that is considered, but a responsibility that is embraced by 
teachers. The state of Virginia discussed the importance of teachers 
embracing this responsibility by stating, “Secondary Social Studies and 
English teachers... can tackle prejudice in its worst possible scenario as a 
crucial lesson in human nature as an example of interrelationships of the 
actions of citizens and governments leading to the destruction of human

rights” (State of Virginia 1987, p. 1). If students are unaware of human 
rights, how will they ever be capable of identifying when violations are 
happening? As history has repeatedly proven, those citizens who are 
oblivious to their rights are more likely to have them abused. In addition, 
as evidenced by the events of the WWII Era, citizens who lack human 
rights literacy will be more likely to become indifferent when these 
atrocities are occurring in their country and abroad. Addressing important 
social issues and their effect on human rights violations in the classroom is 
a key component to helping students become better citizens. By openly 
discussing and exploring these issues in the historical context of world 
history, students can more easily conceptualize and identify current human 
rights violations. While identifying social problems is important, teachers 
need to remind students that merely recognizing injustice is not enough. 
As the historical events of the Holocaust, Japanese Internment, and 
Nanjing Massacre indicate, citizens must be willing to stand up for the 
human rights of others, or shameful crimes can take place. Mahatma 
Gandhi, a legendary figure in the human rights movement, once said, “All 
humanity is one undivided and indivisible family, and each one of us is 
responsible for the misdeeds of all the others. I cannot detach myself from 
the wickedest soul” (UHRC Webpage). The inspiring words of Gandhi 
remind us all that being a responsible person means looking out for the 
best interest of others and not just ourselves. While avoiding this 
egocentric viewpoint is particularly difficult in the individualistic society 
of century America, students must be encouraged to fight indifference

and injustice so that atrocities like those during the WWII Era will never 
happen again.

Using Digital Storytelling for Vocabulary Instruction 

Susan Wegmann 

University of Central Florida 

Digital stories are the nexus of people, life events, and digital 
mediums. Storytelling has long been an effective way to communicate 
ideas. With the advent of computer use in schools, storytelling has now 
moved into the technological age with the use of digital stories, or using 
“personal digital technology to combine a number of media into a 
coherent narrative” (p. 15, Ohler, 2008). Since one aspect of content area 
literacy is vocabulary skill development, social studies teachers may find 
success using digital stories to teach vocabulary skills. This presentation 
will describe how teachers can effectively create digital storytelling 
activities for their students. The presenter will discuss the basic processes 
of creating digital stories, such as choosing “fruitful” vocabulary terms, 
developing digital stories using PhotoStory, and assigning and assessing 
digital stories projects. The presentation will end with an open discussion 
of ways to use digital storytelling and potential pitfalls of their use.

Film, Arts and Culture as Community Outreach Tools: 
Perspectives from Singapore 

Victor Yu 

American University Girne, Cyprus (Singapore) 

This article focuses on the Singapore’s government using the film 
and arts both as an economic as well as community outreach tools. It 
argues that the evolution of the state arts policy is a function of the 
economic policy. Its “Creative City” approach is both economically- 
driven as well as arts-centered. At the same time, policy makers have 
introduced many strategies to build a vibrant film and arts sector to make 
the arts more accessible to the community. Cinemas and arts institutions 
also are seeking ways to increase the public’s access and exposure to their 
activities. 

This study raises some of the problems faced by filmmakers, artists 
and arts organizations. Singapore’s policy makers should seriously 
consider some of the recommendations made in this study to ensure that 
the nation remains as an attractive place for creative talents to reside in. 
Both large and small film and arts organizations and institutions play 
equally important roles in shaping the broad background conditions and 
context that set Singapore on a socially inclusive and cohesive path to 
becoming a global creative city.
