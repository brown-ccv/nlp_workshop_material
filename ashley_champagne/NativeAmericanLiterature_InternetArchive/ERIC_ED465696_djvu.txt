ABSTRACT 



This action research paper describes a program initiated by 
teacher researchers to improve academic achievement and interest in social 
studies. The targeted group consisted of fifth graders in a lower middle 
class community in the Midwest. Analysis of the problem- causes data show 
three main factors: curriculum, attitude, and effect. In regard to 
curriculum, the study shows that: (1) the curriculum does not fit the 

multiple intelligences (MI) ; (2) many teachers do not want to change or are 

not trained in teaching using the MI; and (3) there is a lack of authentic 
assessment readily available to teachers. The second factor is attitude. 
Teachers teach using their strongest biases, and the Western education system 
emphasizes math and verbal education. The third factor is effect. Students 
were not using what they have learned or their full potential, and many 
teachers were unaware of their students' talents. The literature review of 
instructional solutions named these categories: Instructional, Behavioral, 
and Interest. The researchers focused on the MI solution, specifically, the 
intervention of the MI approach to social studies . The intervention occurred 
from September 2001 to December 2001. Fifth graders would increase student 
achievement and interest, by participating in multiple intelligence 
activities. Evaluation was by pre- and post-tests, and surveys. Results 
showed that interest in social studies increased 11% as evidenced by the 
student observation checklist and the climate surveys. Average achievement 
grade on the post-test in the experimental class was 77% as opposed to the 
control classroom's average grade of 70%. Appended are: Parent Letter; 

Consent to Participate; Social Studies Pre- /Post- Interest Survey; Seven

ABSTRACT 



1 



This action research paper describes a program initiated by teacher researchers for the 
purpose of improving academic achievement and interest in social studies. The targeted group 
consisted of fifth graders in a lower middle class community in the Midwest. 

The analysis of the problem causes data shows three main factors: curriculum, attitude, 
and effect. In regard to curriculum, the study shows: that the curriculum does not fit the multiple 
intelligences (MI), that many teachers do not want to change or are not trained in teaching using 
the MI, that there is a lack of authentic assessment readily available to teachers. The second 
factor is attitude. Teachers teach using their strongest biases and the Western education system 
emphasizes math and verbal education. The last factor is effect. Students are not using what 
they have learned or their full potential, and many teachers are unaware of their student’s talents. 

The literature review of instructional solutions named these categories: Instructional, 
behavioral, and interest. These researchers focused on the solution of MI, specifically, the 
intervention of the MI approach to social studies. The intervention will take place during the 
period of September 2001 to December 2001. Fifth graders will increase student achievement 
and interest, by participating in multiple intelligence activities. It will be evaluated by pre and 
post-tests, and surveys. 

The results show that interest in social studies has increased 1 1% as evidenced by the 
student observation checklist and the climate surveys. The average achievement grade on the 
post-test in the experimental class was 77% as opposed to the control classroom’s average grade 
of 70%.

CHAPTER 1 

PROBLEM STATEMENT AND CONTEXT 
General Statement of the Problem 

Teaching strategies in social studies address only two intelligences, mathematical logical 
and verbal linguistic. Consequently targeted fifth grade students demonstrate a lack of interest 
and low academic scores in social studies. Evidence of this existing problem is low test scores, 
lack of teaching strategies embodying the multiple intelligences and low interest. 

Immediate Problem Context 

The targeted elementary school consists of kindergarten through sixth grade students and 
is located in a mid-western suburb. The school has provided educational services to the area 
since 1961. The one story brick building is housed on three acres of land. The school is divided 
into two wings, the primary and intermediate. There are 18 classrooms, an art room, library, a 
computer lab with 35 computers, a gymnasium, a multi-purpose room (used for lunch and school 
assemblies), and several other smaller rooms. In 2000 two additional classrooms were added in 
the form of mobiles in the rear of the school. These mobiles house a fourth grade class and one 
intermediate ESL(English as a Second Language) class. The school surrounding grounds include 
a community of homes, a large open field, basketball hoops, and two playground areas.

The total student population is 437. The students are from varying backgrounds: 53.3% 
Caucasian, 5.8% African-American, 20.4% Mexican-American, 20.4% Asian/Pacific Islander. 
The majority of these students come from lower middle class income families, with 30.7% 
coming from low-income families. 

The school day begins at 8:00 a.m. and ends at 2:00 p.m. The attendance rate is 95.2 /o, 
the mobility rate is 25.1% and the chronic truancy is at 2.1%. Of the 437 students that attend the 
school, 247 are bused. The average class size for the kindergarten is 19 students, first grade 26, 
second grade 16, third grade 18.3, fourth grade 25.5, fifth grade 23.5, and sixth grade 27 students. 

Each classroom is equipped with one computer, a printer, a 27” television, VCR (video 
cassette recorder), three chalkboards, five bulletin boards, an intercom system, one sink, a 
drinking fountain, a heating unit, one ceiling fan, an American Flag, 18 cabinets, 14 shelves, two 
closets, and one bathroom in every primary classroom. All but one classroom contain windows. 
In addition to basic academic classes, the school has a fine arts program that offers physical 
education, art, and music to the students once a week. 

The administrative staff is composed of one principal. There are 46 staff members; 20 of 
these are classroom teachers (19 female and one male) with 12 average years of expenence. 
Thirty-six percent of the teachers have a Master’s degree and 2% have a Master s degree plus 
hours. The special service staff consists of a part-time school nurse, a speech and language 
therapist, a psychologist, a social worker, a social work intern, two teachers for behaviorally 
disturbed (BD) students, two resource teachers for learning disabled (LD) students. There is also 
an (ESL) program housed in this elementary school. The program has a staff of five teachers and 
five teaching assistants.

This school offers many special programs to the student population. Programs include: 
after school academy (extra-curricular activities), Peer Mediators, DARE (Drug Awareness 
Resistance Education), Rainbows, First Steps, PAL (Project Accelerated Literacy) band, chorus, 

a school store, and B.O.B. (Battle of the Books). 

The Surrounding Community 

The unit school district has a population of 37,705 students who attend 38 elementary 
schools (kindergarten through sixth grade), seven middle schools and three high schools. It 
consists of nine separate communities that cover a 90 square mile boundary that extends into 

three counties. 

The school district is overseen by a superintendent. There are four area superintendents 
that are under his administration. The area superintendents are responsible for a group of schools 
and the principals. The principals are in charge of the daily running of the school. 

The student population of the district includes a variety of ethnic and cultural 
backgrounds including: 56.68% Caucasian, 29.19% Hispanic, 7.46% African-American, 6.56% 
Asian American, and 11% Native American. The instructional expenditure per pupil in this 
district is $4,344, and the operating expenditure per pupil is $6,953. 

The unit school district has 2,644 teachers. The district spends 70.3% on education, 5.1% 
on operations and maintenance, 4.4% on transportation, 6.3% on bond and interest, 2 .j /o on 
municipal retirement/ social security and, 11.6% on site and construction/capital improvement. 

This particular site’s population comes mainly from one of the nine surrounding 
communities, with ESL students coming from all of the nine communities. This is because this 
elementary school is the only one in the district that accommodates the ESL students. The 

O

community’s population is 35,579. This community boasts the youngest residents with a 
median resident age of 28. The median family income is $49,916 and the average home value is 
listed at $101,000. The community administration consists of a mayor and six trustees, and is 
serviced by one park district. Also included is a large recreational facility that offers many 
different types of programs to the residents in the district. The area can be described as a family 
community, mainly residential with many franchise businesses and restaurants. Business 
industry in this area is considered strong. This community was established in the 19 th century. It 
has eight churches of various denominations, a library, many community organizations and is 
fully incorporated. 

This site is affiliated with several resources in the community. Included is a 
Grandparents Program that meets twice per month. Grandparents come to the school and help 
out in each of the classrooms. Another partnership is with a local gasoline service. This station 
allows one-half cent per gallon pumped on every Tuesday of the month to be donated to the 
school. Several of the parents are very active in and supportive of the school committees. These 
committees include PAC (Parent Advisory Committee), and a parent/teacher organization. 

National Context of the Problem 

“During the past century, there has been considerable movement on the intelligence front, 
and this trend shows no sign of abating” (Gardner, 1983, pg. 1). The term intelligence has been 
used in several ways throughout history. Most people have used the word to describe the mental 
power of themselves and others. People are also considered intelligent if they are wise, eloquent, 
or quick witted. 

The IQ test has also become an important part of American society. IQ’s can be

measured and scored by a single number. The problem with using “standardized measures of 
intelligence such as the IQ score is that it measures a static quantity of intelligence present at 
birth, and that claims to indicate achievement potential” (Weber, 1996, pg. 3). Unfortunately, 
schools in the United States are guilty of using this system. 

Students in American schools have difficulty understanding what they have learned. 

They can remember facts, but they can’t think critically or creatively. Gardner points out that 
“Schools system often focus on a narrow range of intelligence that involves primarily verbal- 
linguistic and mathematical- logical skills”(Weber, 1992, p.2). Students who demonstrated 
proficiency in these two intelligences are at the head of the class, while students who are strong 
in others fall behind. Gardner also states that “it makes little sense to treat everyone in a one- 
size- fits- all manner”(Gardner & Veenama, 1996, p. 2). Children seldom leam well in 
conventional classrooms. If they are put in remedial programs, they will usually continue to fail 
because they get more of the same teaching approaches that were wrong from the start. 

Using different modalities is vital to the learning process. Classroom teachers tend to 
spend a large amount of time on traditional book and paper -and -pencil tasks instead of teaching 
in a way that could engage the students in active learning. When teachers do involve their 
students in active learning by using multiple intelligence, they tend to focus on the modality that 
the teacher is comfortable with. However, this is not always comfortable for all the students. 

Teachers will also use a type of teaching called whole- group instruction. This involves 
all the students doing the same task at the same time. Unfortunately, this form of instruction is 
one of the least effective. Children are diverse in their needs and intelligences and should have 
the opportunity to leam by using a learning style in which they’re comfortable. Robert Sternberg

and Todd Lubart maintain, “Rather than put obstacles in their paths, let’s do all that we can to 
value and encourage the creativity of the students in our schools”(Weber, 1992, p. 2). 

The education system is not the only factor in determining what type of intelligence is 
important. The culture as a whole favors certain intelligences. North American culture favors 
verbal- linguistic and logical- mathematical and plays down others such as kinesthetic. These 
biases have a strong effect on the culture of the schools. They can limit such things as 
assessments, instructional strategies, and how intelligence is measured. Gardner argues that 
“Western civilization has crafted a curriculum approach that limits intellectual growth for the 
majority of the students. That is, too many intelligent students are forced to under- achieve since 
no provision to educate their particular intelligence appears to exist”(Weber, 1992, p. 2). 

Heredity and genetics also play a part in each person’s intelligence. Even before birth, 
each person has a predisposition to intelligence. 

The human being is more than their intellectual powers. Perhaps more crucial than 
intelligence in the human firmament are motivation, personality, emotions, and will. If 
we are ever to obtain a comprehensive and fully integrated picture of human beings, we 
need to mold our insights in respect to these other aspects of the human being (Gardner, 
1991, pg. 4). - 

The concept of intelligence has developed and reformed throughout history. Education in 
North .America has focused on only a few of the intelligences. If educators find ways to teach to 
the students’ strongest intelligences, the students could have more success in school.

CHAPTER 2 

PROBLEM DOCUMENTATION 
Problem Evidence 

In order to document the students’ lack of interest and low scores in social studies, the 
teacher-researchers administered a student pre-interest survey and examined the fourth grade 
report cards of the current fifth grade classes. In order to document the teacher’s lack of 
addressing all intelligences in their teaching strategies, a teacher survey was conducted 
(Appendix A). The pre-interest survey was given the second week of school to the targeted fifth 
grade, the experimental group (class A) and the control group (class B). 

Class A contains 27 students and class B has 25 students. This survey contained 17 
questions regarding the students’ interest in learning, typical ways of learning,. individual 
learning, partner learning, cooperative, and hands-on learning. Each student was asked to 
respond with agree, neutral or disagree. In order to document teacher’s lack of addressing all 
intelligences in their teaching strategies, a teacher survey was conducted (Appendix A).

Low academic scores, as well as a lack of interest, was demonstrated in social studies by 
the fifth grade students. Low test scores from the pre-test and previous year’s social studies 
grades are evidence of this as well as the pre-interest survey scores. 

• A teacher survey (Appendix A) was given to classroom teachers inquiring about their use 
of multiple intelligence in social studies. The results indicate that only 22% of the classroom 
teachers use multiple intelligence strategies. This demonstrates a lack of knowledge about 
multiple intelligence or the lack of desire to teach it. 

Probable Causes 

Multiple intelligences is a theory developed by Dr. Howard Gardner. According to his 
theory there are eight intelligences: visual/spatial, bodily/kinesthetic, musical, interpersonal, 




15 



11 



intrapersonal, and naturalist. Gardner believes that the eight intelligences are independent, in 
that they develop at different time and to different degrees in different individuals. 

Attitudes of teachers, administrators and the community, achievement expectations, and 
curriculums are some obstacles to overcome. The negative attitudes of educators and non- 
educators in the community can prevent multiple intelligences from being taught in the 
classroom. 

One problem that schools face is that their curriculums do not fit the multiple intelligence 
model. Many educators will categorize students on the basis of their standardized test scores. 
These scores claim to indicate the students’ potential for achievement. It is also an easy way for 
educators to group or label students without really knowing them or what their strengths are 
(Weber, 1992). 

A second problem with multiple intelligences fitting into the curriculum is the 
lack of authentic assessments readily available to educators. Since students come into the 
classroom with different skills and intelligences, “. . .it is impossible as well as impractical, for a 
teacher to accommodate every lesson to all learning styles found within the classroom” (Lazear, 
1992, p. 2). Assessing these students, authentically, with all their differences, would be a great 
challenge and a tedious undertaking for many educators. 

A third issue involves teacher training. “Teachers often don’t know how to 
implement the theories in the classroom, and they recognize (correctly) that incorrect 
implementations of a theory can do more harm than good” (Sternberg, Torff, Grigorenko, 1998, 
pi). Multiple intelligence methods are difficult for many educators to institute. It is very 
laborious for these educators to create lessons in ways that match the varied strengths of the 
students (Granat, 1997). Educators should not measure intelligence solely through rote 




16 



12 

memorization. Their job needs to go beyond identifying intelligence to developing ways to teach 
it in the classroom. “Educators must find ways to share that knowledge with the students 
themselves so that they will be able to use their skills in situations outside of our classrooms” 
(McClaskey, 1995, p. 5). 

The final evidence of school curriculums not conforming to the multiple 
intelligence model is the lack of active learning in many schools. “Drill and practice is a 
monotonous, repetitive task” (Campbell, 1993, p. 2). In a great many schools, however, this is 
the norm. “Why do we not know if our students are talented in art, music, dance, athletic, 
mechanical repair, computer programming, or are creative in other non-traditional ways? It is 
because, like regular educators, we care only about competence in its more traditional bookish 
sense” (Poplin in Armstrong, 1988). “Classroom teachers spend too much time on paper-and- 
pencil activities and not enough time on active learning that engages the total individual 
(Armstrong, 1988, p. 1). 

Besides school curriculum, the attitude of educators as well as the school culture 
can prevent all the intelligences being taught. As many educators can attest, teachers often 
become inflexible in their ways. They are satisfied with their teaching strategy and they do not 
want to change and they do not want to change. Teachers may also believe that interventions ... 
“hurt, rather than help scores on classroom, statewide, and nationally standardized tests that 
emphasize memory more than they do the sophisticated kinds of thinking required for some of 
these programs”(Steinberg, Torff, Grigorenko, 1998, p.l). 

Additionally, the culture in which we live in plays an important role. “The cultural value 
placed upon the ability to perform certain tasks provides motivation to become skilled in those 
areas. Thus, while particular intelligences might be highly evolved in many people of one 




17 



13 

culture, those same intelligences might not be developed in the individuals of another (Gardner, 
1983, p. 2). “The school systems in the West often focus on a narrow range of intelligence that 
involves primarily verbal/linguistic and logical/mathematical skills” (Dickinson, 1999, p. 1). 
Gardner agrees as he points out . .that western civilization has crafted a curriculum approach 
that limits intellectual growth for the majority of students.” Furthermore, Gardner, in 1992, 
stated, “There are at least seven intelligences, of which only two, linguistic and 
logical/mathematical are prized in the West” (Weber, 1992, p. 2). 

In comparing the literature to the investigation site the same problems and concerns exist. 
Changing a teaching style is an attitude that teachers, administrators, and the community must try 
to change in order to be beneficial. In the targeted building, teachers are working harder on 
including “learning disabled” children in regular classes and therefore, are working “harder not 
“smarter” on how to teach these children. Unfortunately, using multiple intelligences as a 
teaching style is very difficult to incorporate as a tool to learning. Teachers have a difficult time 
in letting the students take charge of their learning in the style they will succeed as evidenced by 
the teacher survey.

CHAPTER 3 

THE SOLUTION STRATEGY 
Literature Review 

“When children have the opportunity to learn through their strengths, they may become 
more successful at learning all subjects — including the ‘basic skills’” (Dickinson, 2000, p.l). 
There are many changes that need to take place before the multiple intelligences model can be 
taught. By experiencing how the multiple intelligence model works, teachers, administrators, 
and the community might find that their attitudes may change. “By broadening our view of 
intelligence, and valuing and nurturing abilities. . .we can open doors by using the strengths of 
children as a means of complementing their less developed areas” (Hine, 2001, p.3). 

A study has shown that students had increased multi-modal skills, improved attitudes and 
behavior due to the use of a multiple intelligence model. A teacher remarked, 

.. .that due to the nature of the program, I developed different skills than I previously 
relied on when standing in front of a class lecturing each day. I began to observe my 
students from seven new perspectives. I began working with them rather than for 
them. . .1 even began to wonder who was changing the most, my students or myself 
(Campbell, 1990, p.3).

Most students will not only have a better attitude about learning; they may also have a 
better chance of achieving. Students will be able to understand their own learning process 
because they will experience it. “Allowing students to use their knowledge about how they leam 
best can increase their enthusiasm, raise their achievement levels, and foster growth in their other 
intelligences” (Sweet, 1998, p.l). 

When students find out what they can be successful at, they are able to develop strengths, 
interests, needs, and talents. “The beauty of incorporating Howard Gardner’s eight intelligences 
into the classroom is that it allows for all children to leam through their strengths and to share 
their expertise” (Beckman, 2001, p.4). One of the biggest benefits to using the multiple 
intelligences model is that most students experience, and maybe even become proficient at, new 
intelligences. “Children can leam through their strengths and can articulate their individual 
talents while gaining literacy in several modes” (Campbell, 1993, p.4). 

Changes can also occur in the school’s curriculums to promote the use of multiple 
intelligences. “Instead of focusing on deficiencies — what kids can’t do — education should be 
based on growth — how kids leam” (Armstrong, 1994, p.l). Children who are “learning 
different”, are often labeled as learning disabled. Unfortunately, these children are often taught 
in a school where the curriculum is based around language arts and mathematical skills. 

Teachers need to find out what their students are successful at and help them develop their 
strengths in the classroom. This can benefit not only the “learning different”, but “normal”, and 
“gifted” children as well. 

One way to achieve this in the classroom is to replace circle time and other whole group 
activities other more individualized activities such as centers. Teachers may feel that this would 
be difficult because they may fear losing control of their class. However, this approach can 





16 

enable the students to learn in a way that is comfortable for them. Ideas for centers can include a 
book nook (linguistic), a math/science lab (logical/mathematical), games/discussion area 
(interpersonal), open space for movement (bodily/kinesthetic), a listening lab (music), a quiet 
space (intrapersonal), and an art/media center (spatial). For the teacher who may feel 
overwhelmed by creating so many centers, “All a teacher has to do is teach seven different ways 
on seven different days. Thus, at the end of seven days, the teacher would have presented the 
skills through every child’s strongest intelligence” (Armstrong, 1994, p.4). 

By Changing attitudes of students, teachers, administrators, and the community, as well as 
achievement expectations of students, it is possible to make certain that schools are given the 
option to teach the multiple intelligences model. Changing a school’s or district’s curriculum is 
not an easy task, but there are many benefits that would make it a worthwhile effort. 

Project Objectives and Processes 

As a result of using multiple intelligences in the classroom, during the period of 
September 1, 2001 to December 1, 2001, the targeted fifth grade students will increase their 
achievement scores in social studies by five percent as measured by their final grade. As a result 
of using multiple intelligence in the classroom, during the period of September 1, 2001 to 
December 1, 2001, the targeted fifth grade students will increase their interest level by five 
points, as measured by the post interest survey. 

In order to accomplish the project objectives, the following processes are necessary: 

1 . Create multiple intelligence unit and activities for social studies units on Native 
Americans and colonization. Teachers will need to research different ways to 
implement MI strategies.

2. Designate one class as the experimental group (Class A) and one as the control group 
(Class B) 

3. Introduce to students in the experimental group the concept of multiple intelligences 
and how it will be implemented 

4. Create a center to for each intelligence to allow students in experimental group to 
choose how they will learn 

5. A rubric will be created at the beginning of each unit by the teacher researchers to 
evaluate student work. It will be used once a week for one assignment to see how 
well students’ work in the experimental group (Class A) is improving. 

6. Present content in a way that addresses the various intelligences to experimental 
group so children will want to learn and participate. This will improve teacher 
attitude as well. 

7. Present content using direct teaching to the control group

Methods of Assessment 

The design method being used during the research project is a quasi experimental design 
of action research. The instruments being to conduct this research project are named below with 
a brief description of the process (Appendix B). 

A pre and post-test will be given for each of the two social studies units that are created 
by both teacher researchers conducting the experiment. It will be given to the children in both 
class A and class B prior to starting the unit and then again at the end of the unit. There is one 
test for each unit of study. The student pre and post interest survey is to show student attitudes 
toward social studies. It will be given to prior to beginning the research study and then again at 
the end. The MI test is a test designed to identify each child’s strongest intelligence. This will 
only be given to class A prior to starting the first unit of study. The teacher observation checklist 
will be used during the teaching of social studies, to ensure the teacher researcher is covering all 
multiple intelligences. Another teacher researcher who is involved with the study will do it once 
a week. The student observation checklist will be used by the teacher researchers to observe 
students’ attitudes during social studies. This observation will take place during social studies 
twice a week for both groups. The classroom climate survey will be given once a week to both 
groups to see what students think about the activities.

CHAPTER 4 
PROJECT RESULTS 
Historical Description of the Intervention 

The objective of this project was to improve students’ achievement and increase their 
interest in social studies by using various multiple intelligences. The targeted classrooms were 
comprised of two fifth grade elementary school classes. Class A was the experimental group and 
was taught using the multiple intelligence strategies. Class B was the control group. 

Interventions implementing multiple intelligences were selected to effect the desired changes. 

The teaching of the multiple intelligences occurred at the beginning of the intervention 
for class A because the researchers determined these intelligences needed to be known prior to 
the students beginning the social studies unit. The learning of multiple intelligences included the 
students taking a multiple intelligence test that indicated each student’s strongest intelligence. 

A parent letter (Appendix A) was sent home at parent night informing the parents and/or 
guardians that the teacher-researchers were researching the possibility of using multiple 
intelligences while working academically in social studies. More than 96% of the parents were 
in favor of this and agreed that their children should participate. Many asked interested questions 
and some parents with children in the control group (Class B) expressed concern about their 




31 



27 



child not getting the same caliber of education that the experimental class (Class A) would be 
receiving. They were consoled and agreed to the program. 

The first phase of the action plan was to collect data to determine which facts about 
Native Americans the students knew and what their interest level was in social studies. This was 
accomplished by giving the participants in both classes a student pre-interest survey (Appendix 
A) the first week of school. The researchers noted that there seemed to be somewhat of an 
interest in social studies in both the control class and the experimental class. 

The second step was to give a pre-test (Appendix A) developed by the researchers. The 
test contained matching questions, multiple-choice questions, and an essay question pertaining to 
Native Americans. This was given to both groups of students before the direct teaching of the 
Native American unit. The pre-test showed the students’ knowledge of the social studies 
curriculum as opposed to the interest survey which showed what the students enjoyed or did not 
enjoy about social studies. It also indicated the areas students needed to work on to further 
develop knowledge of the Native Americans in social studies. The students were rated as mastery 
100%-85%, partial mastery 84%-60%, and non-mastery 59%-0%. It was noted by the 
researchers that the average score on the pre-test was 41% in Class A, the experimental group 
and 27% in Class B, the control group. 

The third phase of the intervention involved using Student Observation Checklists 
(Appendix B) while the students in class A were involved in classroom assignments. This was 
an on-going observation of the students to see if they were participating, on-task, volunteering, 
asking questions, and how they were working with other students. Marks of “frequently”, 



O 

ERLC 



32 



28 



“sometimes”, or “not yet” were given according to teacher observation. Student observations 
were done once each week. 

Each week for 14 consecutive weeks, the teacher-researchers taught the Native American 
unit during social studies. Social studies was taught approximately two days per week for one 
hour each day. Because of extenuating circumstances such as the DAJRE (Drug awareness 
resistance education), social studies was not taught as often as planned. Therefore, the unit on 
Native Americans took longer than originally anticipated. The unit on colonization was not used 
for the research project as originally intended. 

Activities in Class A varied. This was done to ensure that all intelligences were used and 
that each student had the opportunity to do assignments using their strongest intelligence. The 
students were also able to do activities in intelligences other than their strongest. This may 
benefit them as research has shown that exposure to intelligences which are not the student’s 
strongest could lead to a more positive performance in those areas. 

Class A began each social studies class period by doing an interactive bulletin board. 

This activity was done as a whole class and represented the visual/spatial intelligence. The 
bulletin board had an outline of what is now the United States. Each class period was started by 
members of a group putting color-coded pieces of the different regions where the Native 
Americans lived and what tribe actually lived there. This gave the students instant visual 
identification of the regions. 

The interpersonal intelligence was represented by the group time taking place in class. 
The class was divided into five groups representing the five Native American regions: Northwest 
Coast, Southwest, Plains, Southeast Woodlands, and Northeast Woodlands. Each group was 




33 



responsible for researching the food the Native American tribe who lived in their region ate, 
what they wore, in what type of houses they lived, the crafts they did, and the weapons and tools 
they used. The whole group together could do this research, or they could choose to each 
investigate one part and share with the group what they found. 

A five-paragraph essay was used to address the verbal/linguistic intelligence. The 
information found while researching with their group is what needed to be covered in their 
writing. The paper was graded based on the incorporation of all the required information and the 
usage of proper English conventions in their writing. 

Students were able to build a model of the house in which the Native American tribe in 
their region would have lived. This activity addressed the bodily/kinesthetic learner because of 
the process of actually assembling something. It was also a beneficial activity for the naturalist 
intelligence because of the opportunity to use items from nature. The model could be made from 
any material. Some examples include natural materials such as mud, grass, sticks and rocks. 
Other materials could be found around the students’ homes such as craft sticks, fabric, toothpicks 
and newspaper for making paper mache. The final products were displayed in the school’s 
library. 

After the information was found, the paper written, and the model built, the students gave 
a speech about what they had learned. The speech also required a visual aid: clothes, artifacts, 
poster, overhead, etc. This activity covered both verbal/linguistic and visual/spatial intelligences. 

Centers occurred in Class A approximately every other week. Examples of centers 
included: listening to Native American music and legends on tape (intrapersonal and musical), 
Native .American math games using sticks (mathematical/logical and bodily/kinesthetic), Native 



30 

American art such as dream catchers, totem poles and teepees (visual/ spatial and 
bodily/kinesthetic), group work on the research and the paper (interpersonal), and creative 
writing such as symbol writing (verbal/linguistic). 

Along with special activities, every day information was covered by students’ jigsawing. 
Jigsawing involves each group of students learning a section of the text and presenting the 
information to the class. The group chose to present the information using any intelligence. 
Examples included games, songs, stories, or direct teaching. The rest of the class had the 
responsibility to pay attention, leam the material, and ask any questions if they did not 
understand. The teacher was there to supplement the information if necessary. 

The final test for Class A included choices as well. For one question, the students were 
able to choose to compose a song, draw a picture, create a venn diagram, or write a short essay. 

Students responded favorably to the various activities. One student wrote on their climate 
survey that they enjoyed learning about Native Americans because. ..’’it was interesting to do the 
research and the interactive bulletin board”. Another student wrote, “I wish we could do more 
activities like building houses”. 

Class B’s curriculum centered on reading from the textbook and answering the questions 
at the end of the section or doing a worksheet. The class read aloud, silently, and both in class 
and at home. A student from this class commented on his climate survey, “I felt tired and 
exhausted because I didn’t want to do social studies”. The format of class B’s post test was 
identical to the class A’s test in format.

The project culminated in December, 2001, with a post- interest survey and a post-test 
(Appendix A) given to all the students who had been involved in the intervention. The results 
showed the gains in Class A’s students had made in the amount that they enjoyed social studies. 

Students from the Class B remarked, “I feel like I’m going to die”, and that learning about 
Native Americans was. .."boring because there wasn’t anything interesting”. Some students, 
however, enjoyed learning new things and remarked about the things they learned. 

Presentation and Analysis of Results 

The teacher-researchers used multiple intelligence strategies in Class A to improve 
students’ interest and achievement in social studies. The results were compared to Class B’s 
interest and achievement at the end of the unit on Native Americans. The teacher-researchers 
used pre-tests and post-tests to compare achievement among classes. The post- tests were used to 
compare achievement between the two classes. Pre-interest and post-interest surveys were used 
to demonstrate decreases and increases in student interest levels. Climate surveys were used to 
demonstrate a positive increase in student attitudes. Observation checklists were used to 
demonstrate how student participation increased over this twelve-week period. A multiple 
intelligence test was given to demonstrate just how differently children learn. Lastly, a teacher 
observation checklist was used to make sure the teacher was implementing multiple intelligences 
in the unit. The following graphs and tables show in greater detail all of these methods and 
assessments.

Figure 7. Dominant intelligence for the twenty-five students in Class A, the experimental group. 

Figure 7 indicates that in Class A, the experimental group, there are a wide variety of 
intelligences being used. In social studies, the main intelligence that a teacher teaches in is 
verbal/linguistic. Figure 7 indicates that 98% of the students have a dominant intelligence in 
something other than verbal/linguistic. The first bar indicates that only 4% of the students in 
Class A have a dominant intelligence in verbal/linguistic. The second bar indicates that 16% of 
the students have a dominant intelligence in mathematical/logical. The third bar indicates that 
12% of the students have a dominant intelligence in visual/ special. The fourth bar indicates that 
16% of the students have a dominant intelligence in bodily/kinesthetic. The fifth bar indicates 
that 20% of the students have a dominant intelligence in musical/rhythmic. The sixth bar 
indicates that 20% of the students have a dominant intelligence in intrapersonal. The seventh bar 
indicates that 12% of the students have a dominant intelligence in interpersonal. An analysis of 




43 



39 

these percentages demonstrates that the need for multiple intelligence activities in order to 
meet the needs of all students.

Table 8 indicates the student’s attitudes toward learning social studies did not have a 
significant change. The surveys were given every other week. An analysis of table 8 indicates 
that negative responses increased by 16%, neutral responses decreased by 21%, and positive 
responses increased by 4% over a twelve-week period. The students’ attitude toward social 
studies was not impacted during the research period, because the classroom environment was the 
same as it had always been. 

Conclusions and Recommendations 

Based on the presentation and analysis of the data on improving students’ knowledge and 
interest in social studies, the students showed marked growth. The use of multiple intelligences 
provided the necessary structure for the researcher’s activities. Post-observation results also 
indicated that substantial gains had been made in improving the targeted students’ learning 
behaviors during class activities.

Students need to be aware that people learn differently and have their own strengths 
and weaknesses. Experience and research show that students leam best when doing activities 
that are enjoyable to them. 

An important job of teachers is to meet the needs of each student. This task is one 
that has been up to the individual teacher to discover. Each child is unique in the way they leam 
and what they enjoy. Once their needs are identified, an educator is able to tailor a program that 
will work best for each child. 

The teacher-researchers feel that one way to meet the needs of children are to help them 
find activities they enjoy and ones in which they can excel. One of the procedures to make this 
happen is to identify the students’ strongest intelligence. This can be done by administering a 
multiple intelligence test to the students and then creating activities in which students have a 
chance to succeed in their strong intelligences. 

The students learned they needed to-depend on each other during group activities. 

Students whose intelligence was strongest in bodily/kinesthetic, for instance, may need to assist 
others during a model-building activity. A student with a high score in the interpersonal 
intelligence may help other group members to communicate with each other. 

Students were observed once per week for the desired skills used during activities such as 
if the student participates, if they are on task, listening to others, asking questions, volunteering, 
and how well they work with group members. 

The student observation checklist was originally going to be done twice per week. This 
proved unreasonable because the number of days social studies was taught was reduced from the 
intended four to two. This was due to other curricular activities that occurred in the beginning of 



O 

ERIC 



48 



44 



the year such as the drug awareness resistance education (DARE). In a situation where social 
studies is taught four to five times per week, two observations may be prudent. 

A rubric to grade weekly activities was initially planned to assess student achievement. 
This tool, however, was nonessential in the experiment and was not used. The teacher- 
researchers recommend the rubric be used as an optional tool if so desired by the interventionist. 

For teachers desiring to implement a program using multiple intelligences, the teacher 
researchers recommend carefully organizing the different activities in advance. Beginning the 
intervention at the start of the school year would be a benefit to both the teacher and the students, 
since, as teachers know, routines are important to children. 

One disadvantage to the intervention was the amount of time needed to implement the 
activities. From the initial multiple intelligence test, to the climate surveys and observations, to 
the actual creation of the multiple intelligence activities, the quantity of time needed is 
tremendous. Prior planning is essential for this endeavor. 

The rationale cited here are some of the reasons why the researchers decided that using 
multiple intelligences would be a suitable way to teach social studies to fifth-grade students. The 
results have assured the teacher-researchers that the benefits of using multiple intelligence 
strategies increase student achievement and interest in social studies versus not using multiple 
intelligence strategies. When students are successful, their enjoyment of the subject increases 
leading to better achievement grades and higher self-esteem.

Dear Parent or Guardian, 

We are currently enrolled in a master’s degree program at Saint Xavier University. This 
program requires me to design and implement a project on an issue that directly affects my 
instruction. I have chosen to examine the affects of using Multiple Intelligence in Social Studies. 

The purpose of this project is to decide if teaching multiple intelligence will improve learning. It 
will help your student gain interest and increase. academic performance. 

We will be conducting our project from September 1, 2001to December 1, 2001. The activities 
related to the project will take place during regular instructional delivery. The gathering of 
information for our project during these activities offers no risks of any kind to your child. 

Your permission allows us to include your student in the reporting of information for our project. 
All information gathered will be kept completely confidential, and information included in the 
project report will be grouped so that no individual can be identified. The report will be used to 
share what I have learned as a result of this project with other professionals in the field of 
education. 

Participation in this study is completely voluntay. You may choose to withdraw form the study 
at any time. If you choose not to participate, information gathered about your student will not be 
included in the report. 

If you have any questions or would like further information about our project, please contact one 
of us at school. 

If you agree to have your student participate in the project, please sign the attached statement and 
return it to us. We will be happy to provide you with a copy of the statement if you wish.
