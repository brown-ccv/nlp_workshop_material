ABSTRACT 

Lessons used in a Hupa bilingual class during the 
1986-87 academic year are compiled in this manual, which was 
generated cooperatively by the Hupa teachers. The lessons are 
arranged in a progression from easier to harder and cover vocabulary, 
conversations, verbs, holidays, and stories. The first two chapters 
present basic vocabulary terms for numbers, body parts, clothing, 
animals, colors, musical instruments, weather, time, and talking 
about one's self — family members, places, pets, favorite foods, and 
hobbies. Chapter 3 presents topics of conversation and includes 
lessons that teach correct language for children to use with elders 
and other ways to convey respect in Hupa culture. Chapter 4 contains 
lessons on Hupa verbs, most of which contain stems, pronoun and tense 
markers, and sometimes markers indicating types of motion or general 
adverbial concepts. In Chapter 5, the holidays section, metaphors in 
the Hupa language are applied to Anglo-American holidays. Names and 
greetings for wach major holiday are created from Hupa verbs that 
describe key events or characters. The final section contains stories 
ranging from retellings of well-known traditional myths, such as **The 
Sucker and the Eel,** to personal experience narratives by Hupa 
teachers. The manual ij illustrated throughout with line drawings, 
and numerous student worksheets are included. (JHZ)

Hupa Activities Book 



Editor's Introduction 

If you ore wondering what the students who take our course are learning, 
we are hoping that this book will answer some of your questions. 
The activities In this book are lessons that were used in the Hupa Bilingual 
class during the 1986-87 academic year. We are putting these lessons 
together into one book so they can be of benefit to students in the future. 
These activities represent differing degrees of difficulty, some are for 
the f Iret year language student, and othere can only be completed by the 
more advanced student. The book follows a progression from easier to 
harder, with the f Iret chapter consisting of a review of vocabulani given 
In the New Hupa Spelling Book. 

After the firet chapter, the book contains new materials generated frem 
the Hupa teachere. The teachere met after the public school day every 
week for the purpose of evaluating the success of the day's lesson, and 
planning the lesson for the next week. This was a cooperative task that 
Involved all of the teachere, and It was a wonderful experience to 
participate in a group that was able to reach a consensus with everyone 
feeling that their opinion was respected. 

Respect was one ef our themes for the year, as some of the lessons in the 
Dramatic Readings chapter show. We performed several group readings 
during the couree of the year. 'Children Showing Respect* Is about respect. 
Respect Is an extremely Important Hupa concept, and these lessons teach 
the correct language for children to use with eldere, and other ways to 
convey respect in Hupa culture. 

A major accompllshnnent for the year Is shown In the Verts chapter. 
As a result of cress-comparative analysis of Hupa and Tolowa as 
Athabaskan verts, we are getting a grasp on how verbs are structured. We 
are learning that most verbs contain stems, prenoun and tense marlcere, 
and sometimes markere Indicating types of motion or other more general 
advertlal concepts. We are learning that there are many ways for verts to 
be put together. Tense changes, for example, can be marlced in the firet 
syllable, or in a middle syllable, or in the final syllable of a vert. 



Because they ore put together from smeller componentb, Hupe verts con be 
adopted to new situotions. The "Holidays' section of the book demonstrotes 
how Hupa longuoge con be crsated. Metophors in the Hupe longuoge ore 
applied to Anglo-Americon holidays; names and greetings for eo :h holiday 
are crsated from Hupa verte that describe Icey events or cheroct^ This 
section shows the flexibility end odoptibility of the Hupe longuoge end of 
Hupa people, who ore evolving into mainstream American life, while 
holding on to the oncestrol longuoge. 

Finolly, this boolc contains some wonderful new stories tronsloted by our 
teochers during the past year. These stories range from retellings of well 
Imown traditionol myths, such as laOHXON DOJM (The Suclcer 0^ 
Eel), to personal experience norrativas by Hupa teachers Harmon Shermen, 
Sr., and Itay Baldy. Every one of the stories tells something unique obout 
the Hupe world view end makee its contribution to the totol f obhc of 
knowledge that Hupas have about the world.

Dear Parents and Teachers, 



We Hupo language teachers have over 30 students vrho are taking Hupa 
language at Hoepa Elennentary Schaol In Humbaldt State UnWerelty's 
Bf lingual Program. We are proud of them far studying the language. They 
learn to listen carefully, to remember exact pronunciations, and to read 
and to write. In the language learning process, they are learning to 
respect our heritage, our elders, and to live e clean life. They learn songs 
sung In the sacred ceremonies, and the sacred meanings of the dances and 
the songs. They learn to take from nature only what they use, and to 
become good cHfzons. 

We feel if the students are taught when they are young, they hove a solid 
foundation that will last them ell of their life. We have some books and 
we are always in the process of compiling new lessons. In order for the 
books and Isssons to be understood, they have to be taught by good 
teachers. Now we have the teachers for this program, and the teachers are 
willing to work with the children. We urge thot recognition is given to the 
need for this program to continue with its staff of teachers. 

Sincerely, 

Hermen Sherman, Sr.

The Hupa language Is terse. A few words can say a lot. The 
Hupa language has sentences of just one word, that are 
translated Into more than one English word. An example Is 
ULU*, 'It's hot' There are many expressions of one or two 
words that would take more words If spoken In English. ^

Indian law 



Hupa Teachers with Lyle Marshall 
11-5-86 

Lyle Marshall: Respect is a concept that our students have when they 
dance Brush Dance. They put their feathers on, and they are respectful. 
Somebody told them that is how they are supposed to act. They put 
their feathers on, and they are very quiet, and very respectful. But as 
soon as they take their feathers off, BOOM, they are right back to their 
old ways. They need to learn that respect isn't Just a concept that 
exists when you put your feathers on. Respect is supposed to be your 
whole life. It's how you are supposed to live. Respect is intertwined, 
if is everyday. It is not Just this one time when you put your feathers 
on. But the Indian kids who are the dancers know what respect is. 
They just need to carry it over Into their life. 

Ray Baldy: In the Brush Dance, if you are disrespectful, you are doing 
a bad thing, you are spoiling the medicine. The purpose of the dance is 
to do a good thing for the woman whose child is stck. That is why it 
is supposed to be done a certain way. 

Lyle Marshall: DUMHWDOUM, when a person sang a good song, a light 
song, or a heavy song, out of respect you would listen to it the first 
time. 

Herman Sherman: He will sing a second time, and a third time, and 
somebody else will sing. 

Ray Baldy: The second time a person will sing, you can jump in the 
middle. 

After that, somebody else will jump in ihe middle. You don't jump in 
the middle again. You don't jump in every time. 

Herman Sherman: And you keep in time, you don't get out of time. 
When you get through with the heavy song, you don't pack basket Now 
they do that, but they never used to do that a long time ago. 

Lyle Marshall All these things will be changed if the kids don't follow 
them correctly, and learn from the elders. Because it is an oral 
tradition, if the kids don't Msten, it will be changed forever

Two stortes about our Hupa way of fishing 



By Hennan Sherman 

Dyeing Nets 

We dye nets with tanoak bark. KtNECTON [tan oakj MtCtTC (barkj 
You boil the bark in a kettle and you put your net into it. You leave it 
there all night. When the net is dyed, the fish don't see it, and they 
swim right into it Boiling the net in bark preserves it, too. Your net 
will last for years. 



The trigger net is mounted on poles approximately 8 feet long. That is 
the way to fish for salmon or eels. You hold the net in the water near 
the rocks by the falls where the fish or eels are. The net has a 
trigger. The fish or eels hit and you can feel them going into the net. 
You Jerk the net out of the water when you feel the fish going into it.

So the Eel he said, "OK, I'll gamble with you." So he sat down, and 
started to gamble. He kept gambling almost all of that day, and he 
would win a little bit, and he would lose that, and finally, the Sucker 
won everything. He even won the bones that the Eel had, those kind of 
forked bones that the Eel had. He won his eyes, h« won his teeth, but 
HI6 teeth he them, so he threw them back to him, and he

Tor this day, the Sucker has bones m it. forked, but the Eel doesn't have 
any. He lost it all to the Sucker on that day. 

Stories like that are usually told in the evening, that is a rule that 
they used to have Indians would sit around the fire and tell it They 
don't tell it during the day, though. But now, it doesn't matter You 
can tell it almost any time. 

OUNHWDOUM XONDWEDtM that means way back in the beginning of 
time. All stories, all 

Legends start out that way, XODt DUMHWDDUM, they always say, in the 
beginning of time. It's a ritual with Indian stories. 




Ort|fi tf tiM 

WMtt DMTdktn Dmct ''^vee 

We hove the legend of how the White Deerskin dance started, end so it 
seems more logical that those tribes that have the dance but don't have the 
legend, took it and adopted it for their own, and used it. 

There's one about a young man who had the songs, and another one about 
where the arrows landed, '^^4 the one from TOKIMtHOt^ is about a guy 
who went up into another world where he had to go, and when he got 
up there, he saw this beautiful blanket made out of woodpecker heads, 
all just real red and beautiful He wanted that blanket, and when he 
came back, he kept thinking in his mind that he was going to buy it. 
He took the money, and he had this magic pole that he traveled with, 
he could travel great distances with that pole, and he pulled himself up 
there, and he told those people who were dancing around there that he 
wanted to buy that blanket, and they told him they weren't selling it. 
"It's part of our religion." 



And at night when he went to bed, he said, "Well, can't I even use it, 
to cover myself with, so that I can see how it feels, and everything? 
So I can touch it." He knew where they put it, and that same night, he 
put the money down, and he took it, and away he went. And they 
started chasing him. He had this pole, and he was ahead of them, and 
the rest of them were going to catch up with him. 

So he came back, and the first place he landed was TOKlMtHDtM, where 
the Big House was, that's where he came from originally. And when he 
heard them coming, he got on the pole, and he jumped, and he jumped 
clear over to MEDtLDtH, and he saw they were coming there, so he got 
back on the pole, and he jumped, and he landed at TCEMtTO. 

He got back down there, and he stayed there just a short while, he 
. tried to fool them by getting in the boat and dancing, and that is why 
when they go down, they are supposed to sing one way when they sing, 
and they used to tell me when they turn around, they change their song, 
and they start singing the other way, they try to fool these people that 
they are going back (.~ the stream, but they weren't really and then 
they change their tune, and they landed, but they landed way on the 
other side, and they came back and forth like that to fool them. 
Finally they landed there, they rested there, they caught up with him, 
and they went clear down to TCELUNDtH. 

147 



-146- 



When he got there, they were coming up on him again, and he came 
down to JANDt)^QTDtH. And from there, they started catching up with 
him. and he went down to MEtCDtl9IDtM, and they landed there, they 
were still after him, and the next thing you know, he went on up to 
tHTUXUU. He went clear up on t r But when they carry that 
Deerskin Dance up there, they cany it up, and they have to make 
medicine halfway up, at that one place where he rested. 

Then he went clear on up, and finally, they gave up, and they told him 
that ever after this, this Is what you will use as a dance, and you can 
have this religion as it is. You dance that many days, and that way. 
And that's the way they do it today

And then they listen. Rnd he told them, 'Thot's the woy it's yoing to

Just kept ogoing with it. If ony port of the regolio weors out, they

2/25/87 



Now you take the Deerskin Donee. My grandmother told me that before 
these other Inolons come down, there mre no Indlons here at all. First he 
made Indians out of sticks. Later there were Indians who came down from 
the sky. This story is about the time he wonted to make some singers, and 
didn't know what in the world to make the singers out of. 

He used every kind of cedar, and oak, and everything else for the sidekicks. 
And be had a certain kind of wood for the bookmen, but he couldn't find any 
wood for the singers. 

'What am I going to do?" he thought. He hod oil kinds of wood. And he 
turned them all into men. So he went to work, and did the only thing he 
could think of. He sat down and he made himself a great big pile. He took 
0 great chunk, right there, and he turned around and he said, 'You be the 
singer." 

He turned out to be a great big fat heavy set man with a good voice, and he 
was a singer. 

After he had all these dancers, he went all these different places, and 
danced. And he said to this one.

Roy Boldy, Colvln Corpenter, 
ItorifMn ^wrmon. Sr., 
Norfannooney 10-29-^ 



Ray: This person wos asking about how did Hupas originate? Where did 
they come from? I told them, "Your guess Is as good as anylMNly's.' 
Nobody rselly knows which was we came, from the coast or this way, 
or from the valley this way, or from the south this way, or we came 
dovm through the mountains, or what. This whole Atheboekan thing 
goes clear down to Arizona. So they might have come up the valleys, or 
ecross the ridges, or they could have come by the oceen. But the whites 
don't know. They could establish it so far, and that's it. As far as 
anything I have read on them anyway. Maybe this is where they come 
from, and sprsad out from here. It could be. They elways talk about 
YIDUKUTQMtT. YIOUKUTQMtT meant the upper world, or woy up north, 
edge of the world. YIDUKUTOMtT. And this mythicel enimal, 
TMtH(DLXtT. and when I was little, I used to think it wos alligator. 
Out up here, et DtSDOMODtW they sold, TAKtHOLXtT. they meant that 
something there would swallow you like e quicksand, it would swallow 
you down, and eat you. And there's another of them down at Big Rock. 
And they used to speak of that in those places. So it must be a 
mythicel animal. When I was talking about that DtLON MtTQ (Waterdog 
Lake et Trinity Summit), they ueed to sey thet its mouth is there, HA 
MtKE, YIDUKUTOMtT. That means whatever is in tnere, the spirit. 
Jimmy used to sey thet if you went fishing there, that thing would get 
ehold of your line end would enep it right off. I told him it must hove 
been o big weterdog in there, o huge big one in there. Ooh, it would pull 
you right in. 

Herman: Up there on the other side of Rickleff 's they used to soy that's 
a bad place up there. 

Ray: There used to be oil kinds of holes, they are kind of oil filled up. 



CoWIn: TEOtCTEN. Lays In the water. Something, some kind of rr.lmol. 
Over at Redwood Creek they would have e name for them, too. And I 
think they meant beaver. 3W0' Is our name for beaver. And that Is 
what makes me think beaver Is what they are telking about. I sow 
where, the other dey, they hed gnawed off and cut these willows by the 
creek, and carrfed the boughe dowa And they ewtm around with them. I 
saw them dieappear, yau dent eee them anymore, and I wonder where 
they went to, but It muet be down in these rocks. Somewhers In there, 
they live in there. 

Herman: Down at the rocks, drwn where I always put my boat, we hod 
big willows. And It looked liice eomebody wee always cutting, so I 
looked at It gaad one dey, end here It wee those beavers who hod been 
cutting In there. There were ehevlnge piled all over. They must have 
sharp teeth. 

We never did have beaver around here a long time ego. 

Roy. They must hove drifted down here, floated down from the Trinity 
Alps or somewhere. They are not native to here, they were planted. 
Sonwbody brought them In. 

Herman: A long time ego when they were building e fish dam up at 
Campbell Field, I wee down there with my father. We used to woric on 
that Fish Dam. I must have been ebout seven years old. And a lot of 
those old fellows were worlcfng there, peeling the poles, end splitting 
sonfie of the small ones end everybody working. So I Just fooled around 
on the side, end a big bird came up from eomeplace, and landed c^ose 
to me. A big black one, I don't know If It was an eegle, or whet. A 
big fellow. CWOrotN Mt^ Is Golden Eagle. 

And I juet sot right there, and I went up to it end touched It. I petted 
it. It didn't do anything. Pretty eoon it took off, it flew way over 
someplace. Pretty soon it come bock again, and landed at the some 
place. So I touched it again, and those old guys worldng there, they told 
me, 'OODWtNDQLEH, you ought not to do thet. DQDWtNDaEiei.' 

He8aid,DUMWQDUM, long time ego, XODIYO, o young fellow mode 
friends withe bird. And DAHWOYtHQTEHTEN is what he sold. So 
the bird flew away and it never did cma bock. So thot's whet those 
old f ellowe told me. Vou never wont to fool with onything like that. 



Roy: Anything stronge used to be o taboo. 

Er|c -162- 



Ray: Long time ago, when I was little, the first white robin, 3WE60 
pure white, I was down there, I was shooting with a 22, and I just 
couldn't believe my eyes. It made noises like a regular robin, but it 
was pure white. It wds down there by what used to be Gronomeyers. 
They had a little orchard down there, and I was down below there. I 
turned around -Tio X ran back hom^ and I told my mother, "I saw 
something strange. It was a robin, but it was pure white. What does 
thz lean? 

Is that bad luck or good luck, or what?" 

She said, "When you see one of those things, it means it's going to be a 
hard winter. There is going to be a lot of snow. But don't bother it, 
don't kill it." I saw another one after that. Another white robin, only 
this one was way up in the mountains. Every so often I guess they 
produce an Albino, because other people have seen them, too. 

When I was younger, the people used to raise a lot of grain. And the 
ducks and geese would come down, and light in those grain fields 
HEG0N3 YIDtTtLE is geese. MtDONtTEL is duck. So in the morning, I 
would look down there in the field, down at old Jim Jackson's, he used 
to raise a lot of grain. They were just sitting there, eating the 
sprouts. And I told my dad, "I am going to get one of those things, 
and kill one of those things." 

He said, "I don't think you are going to get near euough to do it" 
"I said, "OK, I am going to get one of them yet. With my 22. I had 
an old 22 Stevens, singh shot. I got through the mud, I was crawling 
along the fence trying to get there. I got close, and there was one 
all by itself. They all took off. They had a lookout. They didn't tell 
mc that. The rest of them would be eating, but one would be looking 
around. 

Not too many of them come around, but just last year, here a whole 
string of them came along. I stopped and jumped out of the car, and I 
said, "Listen." My wife said, "Oh, oh, geese, honkers." So I was 
pointing up there, and they made a circle and they went on down.

about it. ulti-aviolet and infrared rays will penetrate the atmosphere 
and we won't be able to go outside. We will have to live underground 
We'll be like gophers. If we do go outside, we will have to wear

A Story About My Brother 
Who Just Passed Away 



3/18/e/ 



This happened when he was a little kid. It was wintertime, it was 
snowing. There were about 3 inches of snow on the ground. There were no 
trails and no road on the top of that peak there. So Newt and I started up 
that way. I had a little 22 Special and he was carrying a 3030. 
We going up that way, and he passed by, and I looked there, and there was 
a deer standing there. Close. And I was trying to say, "Here, there is a 
deer standing there.' And he turned around and he said, 'Shoot it." And he 
almost poked it with his gun. That deer came running up there, and it 
stopped, and he was just all in. I shot it, and it was the first one I ever 
killed in my life. He said. This is the way you do it, you dress it out this 
way." And then he told me, 'You take this knife.' I was cutting that deer, 
and I was going to job into him, and he shuddered at me, and I dropped that 
knife, and I dropped back, i was scared of it. 

I said, 'It's still alive, yet.' 'Oh, no,' he said, "that is just the reaction of 
the deer when it is still warm yet.' He showed me how it is done, and it 
fixed it into an Indian pack, where you can get right into the packet. He 
said, 'We'll pack it a little ways. Then we are going to hang it up. So we 
went on that ridge and it started snowing, and the fog comes rolling in 
because it is snowing. 

On the ridge, dad had a horse trail where he blazed the trail. He used to go 
up there towards Four Mile Prairie. So we were going along there and he 
said, 'We'll go along the edge of the prairie in the woods, because 
sometimes they come out on the prairie, we might get one." 

So we started on that prairie, and the fog rolled in, and we were walking 
around there, end I had these old government overshoes on. I slip, and I 
fall, and I get back up, and he was getting ahead of me end I was getting 
kind of tired, because I would slip and fall in that snow. It was a foot 
deep. And it would get down inside my overshoes. 

And we kept walking, end we went around, and all of a sudden we came 
back, and I said, 'Hey, you see those guys tracks? There's two guys ahead 
of us.' He said, 'Yeah, looks like it.' And he said, 'We'll follow them and 
see which way they are going." So we foiled them. We started walking 
around Ihtn, and wa went a little ways, and all of a sudden I said, "Hey, 
that's tha place I fall down. You saw me. That's the place I fell in the 
snow.' We had walked around in a circle, and we came on our own tracks. 
We had followed our own tracks.

'Oh, oh/ he sold, "We're going around in o circle. I don't Icnow how in the 
hecic we did that, but we better get the hecic out of here.' So we waited a 
little while, and the wind was blowing, and the fog would lift. And we 
could see that pealc across from us, Big Hill, and he said, ' Oh, oh, that's 
the say, yeah, we have to go that way." 

I remember oil of that deep snow and how l icept failing down in those 
government overshoes. I Just had on a heavy sweater, because I didn't 
thinic we were going to be gone thot long. But we came back down with 
that one deer, that was the first one I Icilled. 

And he was the one who taught me how to hunt. I used to go along with 
him. We would hunt by foot. 

We set trops, too. One time he decided thot he was going to make money. 
Side m A little money for ourselves. Dad said, 'Well, you can go set traps. 
Vou can catch Coon, Ringtail cat, whatever. Mink. So we went way up 
at the headwaters of Norton Creek. We go up there nd there was no trail. 
So we had our hatchets and we hacked a trail out. We blazed a trail out, 
and set trops and we came back down on the rood. 

We came out, and that was our trap line. And every four days, we would 
go around and check our trap. The only thing we ever caught was a lot of 
coons. 

He mode pretty good money off of those coons. Only no other animals 
would come up that way. Skunks, too, though. Skunks. And there was one 
place where we set trop, and we kept catching those civet ccts. 
Everytime. Everytime you catch a skunk or a civet cat, you have to take 
that trap and smoke it. In pine boughs. Smoke it real hard to get that 
smell out of it. Otherwise, no other animals don't like to go around skunk 
smell on anything. So you have to fix it so you neutralize that 3dor. That 
is the way you do to yourself, too, if you have that smell on your clothes or 
your heir, you make a big smudge out of pine boughs. And you just put it 
all over you. 

That is what I used to do before I would go back to that government school 
they had. Every Sunday I hod to smudge myself, otherwise everybody 

Er|c l-T^I- 



would moke fun of you if you come to school, smelling like o skunk. I 
CQught Q lot of skunk. I used to get $1 o pelt, $.75 o pelt, $1.50 if they were 
real, reel good. But thot wos money, when you got 30 or 40 skunks in 
various sizes. About $30-140. That was o lot of money. 

They used to send out the hides to the New York furriers. 

Herman: I don't know what they did with them. They had prices for 
everything. Coon. And Fox. And Coyote Different prices right on there. 
What they cost. 

Roy: I heard that by the time they got through with them, you couldn't 
even recognize them. We didn't know what they made out of them. But 
they had skunk coats, though. 

Calvin: They made stoles out of them, probably. 

Her~«an: Fisher hides were pretty high-priced. $60-70 a piece. 

Ray: Easy. A good pelt was worth over $100. 

Herman: Otter, too. 

Ray: Otter was prime. Just a certain size was a prime pelt. 

Herman: Mink was pretty good, too. 

Ray: And they were hard to catch in those days. It wasn't easy. 

Ray: But that was the way they supplemented their income around here. A 
dollar went a long way in those days. By the time you spent $5. at the 
Grocery Store, you had an armful. More than an armful, sometimes. Things 
were not expensive. Because I remember the first money I ever earned. 

Do you remember a guy called Johnny Carpenter? They used to call him. 
The Judge.' He came up there and he said, 'I want to h.re you. I want you 
to comt down and help me.' This was is in the late spring, after they had 
planted garden. He said, 'I need a little help.' So he had an old Model T, 
and I Jumped in there and I went up there, and he said, 'I want you to ride 
this horse, and steer him right down between these rows. We are going to 
cultivate this com.' 

i -172- 173 



'OK/ he said, 'Vou go down this soy, and when you rome to the end, you 
moke him turn oround, just right without stepping on all of those plants 
too much, and moke him go back the other way.' 

Ugh) It was dusty, and the dust would fly out, and t was ell dusty, and 
you would get tired going down that road. I did it all day. $.50 he gave 
me. So the first thing he told me, 'Vou can go up to the store with me.' 
There used to be a store, over the hill called, 'David Masten's Store.' 

So we stopped there, and i bought a loaf of bread. Why, i don't know, but I 
thought about a loaf of bread. I was going to treat nny mother so she didn't 
have to bake any bread, I guess. I asked him how much that bread was. I 
wasn't really Intending to buy it. i think It was about $.05 or $.06. I don't 
really know how much It was. 

I bought that bread and I bought a whole bunch of candy. I bought a whole 
mess of candy in bags. He loaded me up. I had my pockets full of candy and 
I had a loaf of bread. We came back. My mother said, 'Well, what did you

bread and a bunch of candy. She didn't know whether to laugh or cry, or 
what. Because they could have used the money on something else, and 
here I spent it already. So after that she told me. The next time you earn 
any money, you give it to me and and we could use it for food.' She 
said, ' That isn't food what you bought.! Bread! i could have baked bread.' 

But I was so proud. I earned $.50. ' had an all day job.

two young Indians 



DUNHW^DUk). a long time ago, two young Indians went hunting up at Tish 
Tang. They had a good trail there, above the falls, way back down It 
ran right back up They had another one. it went down to the falls. 
And that creek in there, they call TA'ANOLtN. 

They went across chat creek, and they hunted on that side. It got late 
on them over there, they killed two deer. They were coming back, and 
that TA'ANOLtN is a big gulch. So they got on the other side, and it 
was pitch dark. One of the fellows said, "If we can get over to the 
main trail, we will be all right, but how are we going to get across?" 
it was pitch dark. 

And they sat over there, and smoked, talking about it. "Well," he said, 
"I guess we will have to tackle it. and go across that gulch in the 
dark. All at once light came from someplace, they said. And they 
went across easy across that gulch. 

When they got back up on that main trail, there was no more light, but 
they knew where they were. They came back down on that main trail. 
HA KtNANDtN. that light. They didn't know wher** it came from 
It was the KtXUNA helping them. They got lucky. 

Ruth Beck. They were so lucky, that's .'.'hat the land will do for you If 
you are good to it. The land will give back to you. it will treat you 
good, too. N+KENCU'ON. Your heart is the key to It.

Sam Brown went up to one of those lakes, I don't know which lake he 
was to. But it started bubbling all at once. In a little while he had 
to get out of there. The lake raised, the trees were standing in water. 

TCtNTEH MtTO 
Turtle mountain 

There used to be a little lake up at Turtle Mountain, TCtNTEH MtTO, 
that's where Beaver Creek starts. I never ran into it, but these other 
lakes I know they are there, because I used to see them all the time. 
That is the one that they used to jump into for good luck. If you jump 
in there, and you are a young man, KUNTOLDWtL, and you want to have 
good luck for the rest of your life or whatever, when you jump in, you 
dive right in, and there are a lot of water dogs in there. If they bite 
on you, and you swim across, and you come out on the other side, if all 
of those water dogs drop off and let go, you will have good luck. If 
they still cling to you after you get out of the water, you won't have 
anything. No good luck. Except for MtCKtT KtUHQTtLE, he jumped in 
there, and he wouldn't come up When he finally did come up, he was 
pale, and he didn't have any more hair, no more eyebrows or anything. 

To this day, they say that anyone who jumps in there, when they lie, 
they will have thunder and rain I have heard that said many times. 
When my two nephews died at the same time, it rained that day. It 
rained real hard. And they said they swam in there 

Some places they have found ocean shellfish high in the mountains And 
It was on top of the mountain They think glaciers may have come 
through there Or the land pushed up at one time There is once place 
at the top of Norton Creek when they dug a road there, they dug up 
river rocks there You can find them on the top of Norton Creek, NOXE 
NODOLWOT and another place is called CEHXA NODOLWOT 
another place around there has white rocks laying there They think 
that the rwer may have been as high the creek -ar one time

In Modoc country, all around you can find obsidians, volcanic rock. 
There are mountains made of obsidian In the Medicine Lake, Modoc

one that looked like glass, and they had one red one, and they had a 
white one. 



After the flood, the people regenerated 

KYONYONtYON NOTECDtDWEN 
people regenerated 

OANOOLtNDtM is by Burnt Ranch, HALDtM is near Salyer. That was sort 
of a border for the Hupa tribes and their cousins. And Redwood Creek 
was a sort of a border. They were all about the same. They traded 
with each other, they attended each other's dances, they unoerstood 
each other. 

They used to say that the Hupa people were cowards because when they 
would fight, they would run into the brush. But they weren't cowards, 
that IS the way they would fight. They woold go into the Brush, and 
anybody who would come after them, would never come out 

An old trail that starts out here goes over to the mouth of Redwood 
Creek, that's why those Redwood trees grow up there. There used to be 
a branch of Redwood Creek Indians who hid out for awhile, they went 
out to Bald Hill, then they went to Turtle Mountain. I don't think 
there's anybody left of those people now. 

After the flood they claim the people grew, and they grew at different 
rancherias. KYONYONtN NOTECDtDWEN. They had a flood, the people 
were unruly, just like they get now, people even buried their kids 
alive, they got so bad, they let their kids starve That's why they had 
a flood The people scattered, and they went to seven rancheries 
That's how the rancherias have come about 

Different peoDle qrew up at different rancherias

Fanny told me one time, when we had that old place up at Willow 
Creek, over across the river. Of course, we moved there, but they built a 
different house, but this is where that old chimney used to be. 

That old Mexican Beebe built that house and my mother and my 
grandmother bought that land. 

Every time wintertime would come, it would rain, right in front 
where that porch was built out, the water wou^d stand there. 

Kind of a lake, about knee deep. And Fanny was down there. I was 
just a small kid then, and I was running up and down that porch. 

They told me, 'DQONDHE.' 

I just kept it up. 

She said, 'DQONDHE.' 

All at once, I ran back the second time. And then my grandmother 
89id,' KOTE HWtDOWE TECEXtlCTE.' 
after a while his ears I'll twist 

Fanny got after me twice. Three or four times she told me. I didn't 
listen. All at once, I was running across there tn6 I slipped and I fell. 

I fell on that porch, when I fell on the porch, I rolled over and I fell 
right in that mud hole. I rolled around in that mud. 

"Uh huh,' she said, 'HWtNODO HOLEN.'

wringing wet. 

My grandmother got mad at me. She didn't spank me, though. She 
made me change all my clothes. 

She said I had to take a bath and when she gave me the bath, she 
bathed me in cold water. Then she gave me long underwear and put that on, 
and wiped me off and put that underwear on me. Then she sent me to bed 
the rest of the day. It was in wintertime, anyway. 

So she didn't pull my ears and sr^e didn't spank me.

CRANE STORY joid by Roy Boldy 1/2 1 /e6 

HupQ 

He hod long legs. He used to use these strings and he would put it across 
there, so these people could go across there. And they would come along 
and they would sey, ' Hey, NONtCDES," and he would say, 'OK/ and he 
would put his leg across there and they would get across there. 

GENHiEGtCKLQN, for sonne reason, he didn't like that. He was a young 
fellow. He would tell hlnn, 'Stick It across there,' and he got halfway 
across there, end he fell In there. He drowned there. He got out. 

He told that same bird, "There are two pretty girls down there. Someplace 
down there, HWtiawtlsD^UT, down that way.' He said, 'Let's get one. I 
want to get one of those pretty girls ' He said, 'I am going to get the 
prettiest one, because I am handsome.' 

So they started down Weitchpec way, and when they got down there, those 
girls wouldn't look at the Crane. No way. Instead of the little boat that 
they had. Crone had a great big boat. He thought he would invite them into 
hie boat, but they wouldn't get in But this little, dinky boat that the other 
one hod, they got in this little thing. 

That sort of made him mad. So he started making medicine, and he called 
for the wind. A Storm came up and he was aways down the river, and here 
that boat was Just riding up and down on the waves, up and down. He tried 
to get them, but they got away anyways. 

They used to sing a song about XOCLtNTO. That was his song.

That Is the same way that YIDOJtNTEL got those girls, too. Down at the 
mouth, he made medicine there. He saw those two pretty girls on the 
§horf making acorn aoup. Hg tried to get near them, but anytime he would 
come up ctoee to thon, they would nm off. They were bashful or

floated down and he floated underneath this Alder Tree bark, turned over, 
and when they saw that, they didn't suspect anything. They thought It was 
Just a llttis piece of baric coming In towards the shore. And they went 
down there, because they had to go down there ever-so-of ten and they 
saw that Thing floating, they came down, and there he was.

At the end of this story, he goes bock to his originol home up In the sky. 
tNNtCON NQNOT— Edge or the world That's where he come from. 
He went up there to get the acorns for his mother. She was the one that 
dug him up, she was the one that did it. And he climbed up the stump. And 
when they were talking up there, the girls were talking about how they 
were going to marry him. They talked about how good-looking he was. He 
was so good-looking that they couldn't even look at him. To them, he was 
so bright, like the sun shining so pretty, instead, they just put their head 
down, and turned their backs. They got bashful, and never did look at him. 

He went up and got the acorns and that's when he talked to his mother the 
first time. And then he got the deer, and then he got the salmon. How he 
got the deer and how he got the salmon is very important. According to 
Rudy, there was no salmon at that time. The people, KYONYONtYON, never 
had any salmon. So he went looking for them, to find out why there were 
no salmon. They were all bottled up in a lake. And there were some people 
there, they were all eating on this fish, and they gave him some. And he 
asked them how to catch them, how to prepare them, and everything. And 
they showed him. 

He destroyed that damn. And he said, 'From now on, everybody wilt have 
fish ir this world. " tNNtCONME. Then he came home, and he showed his 
people how to prepare it. He told them, 'this is the way you do it, this Is 
the way you cut it, this is the way you dry it, this is how eels are 
roasted,' and he showed them all of the processes. How to weave nets. He 
brought back everything. And that is how they began to have fish there. 
Until then, there were no fish nor no deer. Until he turned them lose. 

He was a person who set the world right when he came. JANDtXQTDtvi is

When he got to o certain age, he did oil he could. But he hod o yearning to 
return to his people. That's when he went on a journey. His grandmother 
had provided him with magic. It was a belt, it was medicine. And that's 
why he started bock. There were many obstacles that he had to go through. 
And one of them was on that swing. This old man was around there. He told 
him how good it would be to swing out over this cliff, and he said, "you get 
on it and I'll push you, you will get on a trail, right out over this cliff 
But when he was going to do it, this belt told him not to do it, because it 
told him, 'that old man is going to pick up that rock when you get out 
there, and he is going to throw it and hit you in the back when you get way 
out in the canyon, he is going to eat you. He is a man-eater." 

So he pretended he didn't know how to get out on that swing. And he said, 
'you show me." So the old man he got on there, and he said, 'Listen, this is 
how you do it.' So he pushed him, and he started swinging, and he took that 
rock and the old man dropped down in the canyon, and his words were, 
"From this time on, there will be no more of these practices of killing 
people and eating them ' And when he went on, he came to another place 
where this old man was there, and he had this log and he was splitting it, 
and he hod those wooden wedges In there. And when he got there, he told 
this XOXOLWOiei, 'Can you help me? I can't get this wedge out. It's way 
down in here. Get your hand out and pull it out for me. Pry it loose." 

And he was going to do it, and this magic belt warned him again, 'When you 
put your hand in there, he's going to let the wedge loose, he is going to get 
your hand in there, and he's going to eat you. He is going to do it.' And he 
told the old man, 'I don't know how to do it. How did you say you ore going 
to do it? Show me.' So that old man put his hand down in there, and he 
sprung that trap, and he caught that old man and he killed him. And again, 
he said, 'From now on, nothing like this is going to take place in this 
world."

And he went on, and there were several more obstacles that he went 
through. Eventually, he arrived at his destination, and that was at the 
upper world, at YtDUKUTOMtHDtH. That was where his relations were, 
he was talking to the moon and the sun. And he said, 'I came home to 
travel with you people.' And they told him, 'Only until you can eat half a 
whale to sustain you, you can travel with us. Because you need that much 
to go around the world. When you can eat that much, you n go with us."

And thQt when they found out that he didn't hove any onus, and they said, 
'Well, we will fix thot up.' And they took this elderterry branch, and it 
was hollow, and they stuck it down his throat, and they took these hot 
rocks, and threw them down his throat, and from then on, he could eat. He 
became a mortal, and he could eat half a whale, and they said, 'OK now you 
can travel with us.' And he started travelling with the moon and the sun. 

And that was one of the reasons why when Rudy heard all of this about 
Jesus Christ, how he was bom, and lived, and after he died, was 
resurrected, and went back to his Father, he thought they they were 
somewhat similar, and he always thought that the two lead the same lives, 
and they ended in the same place. The world was set right for the people 
to live in through brotherly love, instead of killing. And sharing instead of 
hoarding.

This f s the story of Rovsn ond Dog In the legendory times. 

DUNHWDOUM that means 'long time ago". Raven challenged the Dog to o 
contest. He sold that he could eat eveqi dead thing around, and the Dog 
could not. The Dog occeptod the challenge. 

Raven told the Dog, "I will go along one side of the TrlnUy River, ond eot 
every dead thing I find along the woy. Vou will go along on the opfNislte 
sids and do ths some. The one who eots oil of the dead things without 
gstting eick will win. 

So they etortid. The Roven storted eoting oil of the deed things on his side 
of the river, and the Dog storted to do the same. The Dog started feeling 
good,butsoonhebegontoget8lck1nthestomoch. The mors he eot, the 
sicker he got, until finally his stomach was so fuli, he wos very sick. 

He etopped and lay down very sick ond his stomach wos so full hs could 
banly move. So he called to the Raven to help him. He aeked the Raven to 
peckoholein hie body to relieve the pressure, but the Roven come and 
started to pack his eyee out. The Dog said, "Not my eyes, I wont you to 
peck a hole In my stomach.' But Raven wouldn't do It. 

As the Dog lay there, he saw some grass by his sids. He picked some ond 
ote them, end he rsgurglteted all of the things he hod eaten and he got over 
his sickness. 

Fonvar iftr, whan Dog gets sick, ha eats grass to make himself well. 
They also tell about an hart that growe in the mountolns thot Hupa peopla 
use to cure the stomach. It is a cure based upon this story about how Dog 
cured his stomach sickness.
