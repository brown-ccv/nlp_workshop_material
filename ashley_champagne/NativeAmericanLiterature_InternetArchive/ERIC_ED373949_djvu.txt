and girls shared their hobbies with each other. Tom showed his 
boats. Emma showed her puppets. Sally played her flute.

Tess knew that soon it would be her turn for show and tell. 
She was very excited. 

"Now we will hear from Tess," Ms. Sherrill said.

Tess walked to the front of the room with a large brown bag 
in her arms. Facing the class, she reached into the bag.

"I want to play some American Indian music," Tess said as 
she pulled a tape recorder out of her bag. "It is the music played at 
Indian Pow Wows today." 

Tess turned on the tape recorder. Music began to drift 
through the room. Most of the students had never heard 
American Indian music before. The high-pitched singing and the 
steady beat of the drum were different from the music they sang. 
But soon the children were nodding their heads. They tapped their 
feet to the rhythm.

Tess reached into her brown bag again. This time she pulled 
out a headband made out of tiny red, white, and blue beads. She 
placed it on her head. Tess also removed two beaded moccasins 
from the bag. She put them on her feet. 

"At the Pow Wow, we dress like Indians did in the old days. 
When girls and women dance, we always wear shawls over our 
shoulders." 

Now Tess pulled a beautiful blue shawl from her bag. It had 
an Indian design on it, painted in white. Long, silky fringes 
dangled from the edge of the shawl. 

"Today Indians from all over the United States and Canada 
have Pow Wows," Tess said. "We celebrate because we are happy 
to be Indians."

When the dance ended, Tess told the children the big news. 

"Saturday night is our Pow Wow. You are all invited!" Ms. 
Sherrill looked surprised but happy. 

"Students," Ms. Sherrill said, "Tess has invited you to attend a 
Pow Wow. I hope you will all be able to go with your mothers and 
fathers."

Ms. Sherrill asked Tess if she had anything else to say. 

"I hope you and your families will come to the Pow Wow," 
Tess said. "Now you know the Round Dance. You can join in the 
dancing. If you come to the Pow Wow, you can have fun the 
American Indian way!"

The students and their teacher sat down. Together they 
watched the Grand Entry. The dancers walked into the gym. The 
men and women wore beautiful costumes. So did the boys and 
girls. They all wore colorful feathers, beads, and cloth. 

A man and a woman led the Indians. Tess explained that 
they were the head woman dancer and the head man dancer. 
They were followed by the head girl and head boy dancers. All of 
the dancers stood silently near the center of the dance floor.

Next an old white-haired Indian man gave a blessing to the 
Creator. He asked for beauty, peace, and good will for everyone at 
the Pow WoW. He spoke in his language, the language of the 
Luiseno Indians from southern California. Then he spoke in 
English. When he was finished, the dancing began.

Indian men and women danced around the drum. The 
children did not understand the words of the song. The men sang 
their songs in the language of the Sioux Indians. 

"Usually the dancers move around the drum in the direction 
of the sun. This is the same direction that the hands of a clock 
move," Tess explained to the children. "In some dances, though, 
they move in the other direction."

The girls and women wore beautiful dresses made of yellow, 
red, black, or purple cloth. The dresses were trimmed with shells, 
beads, or lace. A few women wore buckskin leather dresses with 
long, dangling fringes. All of the women wore shawls over their 
shoulders. One of the children asked Tess why they wore the 
shawls. 

"The women wear shawls to show respect," she answered. "] 
is an old Indian tradition."

When the dance ended, Tess led the class back to the seats. 

"That was very nice!" Ms. Sherrill said. "I am so glad that 
Tess invited us to the Pow Wow." 

Tess was happy and proud. She had shared a special part of 
her Indian heritage. She knew that the students would always 
remember that night. They would remember the fun and 
friendship. They would remember the Round Dance. Most of all, 
they would remember the Pow Wow.
