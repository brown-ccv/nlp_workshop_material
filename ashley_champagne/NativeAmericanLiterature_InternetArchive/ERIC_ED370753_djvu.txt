FOREWORD 



It is the mission of the State Department of Education and 
the Native American nations and tribes in Oklahoma to foster a 
cooperative working relationship among state agencies, schools, 
tribes, parents, and others for the preservation and promotion 
of culture and languages through the support of parental 
involvement and refinement of academic excellence to ensure 
Indian youth are leaders in the twenty-first century. 

This publication, composed of a collection from past 
curriculum guides, was developed to provide support to ensure 
that our Indian youth will be thinkers and problem solvers. They 
will also be contributors, achievers, and producers. This 
handbook will give a helping hand to those interested in making 
certain the Native American youth become more involved 
citizens while retaining their unique cultures and languages. 

I gratefully acknowledge and thank the Native American 
educators and tribes for their contributions to this curriculum 
guide.

THE CHEROKEES OF OKLAHOMA 



CONCEPT: 

Endurance has made the Cherokees a powerful Nation. 



PRESENTATION: 

The Cherokee were a powerful tribe of 
Iroquois stock. There were three divisions of the 
tribe; namely the Lower, Middle and Upper 
Cherokee. Each had Its own dialect. The dialect of 
the Upper Cherokee was the one which survived 
and was reduced to writing. The name Cherokee 
Is from "tsalagee" or "tsaragee" which is believed 
to have been derived from the Choctaw term 
"chilukkee" meaning "Cave People," in reference to 
the numerous caves in their mountain country. 
They also sometimes called themselves 
"Ani-yun-w!ya m meaning "real people." 

Before and during the historic period, the 
Cherokee people developed a culture which was 
suited to the environment in which they lived. 
Owning a vast territory in what is now the 
southeastern United States, they lived a hardy life 
based upon hunting and agricultural pursuits. 
Game and fish were plentiful in the virgin forests 
and streams, and crops planted In the rich soils 
produced in abundance. The historic Cherokees 
were not a nomadic people but lived a rather 
settled life in permanent villages built along the 
rivers and streams of the southern mountains. 
They were originally woodland people who had 
begun the cultivation of the soil long before the 
arrival of the first Europeans. Living along the 
rivers and streams of the southern mountains, they 
built houses and tended farms for many centuries 
before they were proffered "civilization." Never at 
any time were they "lawless savages." The reports 
of the earliest explorers and traders support the 
belief that the Cherokees wure among the most 
advanced of the native North American Indian 
tribes. 

This way of life was completely disrupted by 
the advent of the whites who took from the 
Cherokees their ancestral lands, forests and 
streams, and forced them to move to new lands in 
the West - then known as Indian Territory, now as 
eastern Oklahoma. Promises were made to the 



Cherokees that in the West they couid forever 
pursue their own way of life free from interference 
from the white man. Treaties guaranteed the 
Cherokees the right of self-government. A promise 
was given that no territory or state would be 
created out of their lands without their consent, and 
they were given simple title to their western domain. 

The Cherokees were reluctant to give up their 
ancestral homes in the East, but eventually were 
driven by military forces to new land in Indian 
Territory. There they again built their homes, set up 
their government patterned after our own 
constitutional form, and for a time were secure in 
the new environment. 

In the 1860's the Cherokees were again forced 
to rebuild their homes which had been devastated 
by the Civil War. Again they had to rehabilitate 
themselves in the new terrritory. 

In 1893, the government surrounded their 
country, and made the same demand for their 
lands as was made in the East. Agreements were 
forced upon the Cherokees under which they were 
required to give up their tribal title to lands, allot 
their lands to members of the tribe, and give up 
most of the functions of their own government. All 
of this was in order to make way for the creation of 
the new State of Oklahoma. 

The final congressional act in the series 
designed to end the Cherokee government and to 
pave the way for Oklahoma statehood, for reasons 
then best known to Congress, made an important 
distinction between the Cherokee tribe and the 
Cherokee tribal government. The measure 
continued indefinitely, and under its authority, the 
Cherokees, through the years by direction of 
special jurisdictional acts, have been allowed to 
litigate some of their legal and moral claims against 
the people and government of the United States. 

Today the Cherokee Nation is located in 
Tahlequah, Oklahoma and is considered to be one 
of the more progressive tribes in Oklahoma.

INDIANS IN THE CIVIL WAR (1861-1865) 



CONCEPT: 

Indians living in the area that was to become Oklahoma were very much involved in the American 
Civil War. Their Involvement whether great or minimal resulted in hardship, bitterness, division of 
tribal allegiances, and loss of tribal land. 



PRESENTATION: 

In the spring of 1861 before the Civil War 
started, Alfred Pike, the Confederate Commissioner 
of Indian Affairs, visited the Indian tribes in Indian 
Territory or what is now present-day Oklahoma. 
Mr. Pike signed 20 treaties with the tribes of this 
region and his methods of getting the treaties 
signed included the following: finding disenchanted 
tribal members with some recognized authority, 
bribing them, and promising them Confederate 
recognition. These treaties resulted in creating civil 
strife within the tribes themselves. Some of these 
treaties provided for regiments of Indian troops, 
Indian officers, and supplies to be furnished by the 
tribes involved. Many people living in what is now 
Oklahoma wanted the Indian tribes to remain 
neutral for they felt the war between the American 
states was not their fight. 

In July of 1861 the Creek leader, 
Opothleyahola (oh-BITH-Iee) (yaw-HO-lah), urged 
an agreement of neutrality and gathered his loyal 
Indians to test this neutrality stand. Confederate 
Colonel Douglas H. Cooper, a Choctaw agent, sent 
a message to the Creek leader in his final bid for 
Creek and Seminole support of the Confederacy. 
When the message failed to bring about an 
agreement, the Confederate colonel was 
determined to challenge the rights of the loyal 
Indians to maintain their stand of neutrality. 
Colonel Cooper advanced upon the camp of 
Opothleyahola, but he and his followers had 
departed. Colonel Cooper called the loyal Indians 
thieves, cutthroats and renegades, and also said 
they had stolen treasures of other tribes, in order to 
recruit the other tribes to fight against 
Opothleyahola. Most of Opothleyahola's people 
consisted of the Muskogee faction of the Creeks: 
others were some Chickasaws, Quapaws, Euchees, 
Keechis, Caddoes, lonis, Delawares, Wichitas, and 
Cherokees. 

The first battle of the Civil War in Indian 
Territory took place on the south side of the 
Arkansas River, at the rounded end of the mountain 



ending one-fourth mile south of the Cimarron River. 
In the battle of November 19, 1861, at Round 
Mountain, the loyal Indians under Opothleyahola 
drove off the Confederates. Opothleyahola^ 
strategy placed the women and children in the 
middle of the circle and stationed men all around. 
A Chickasaw detachment tried a forced crossing 
over the river, gnawing at the edges of the circle, 
causing the Creeks to switch men from spot to spot 
to cover the circle. A Choctaw detachment tried to 
pierce the thinning lines. A final stroke to end the 
engagement was taken on by a Texas cavalry, but 
they maneuvered clumsily and before they could 
regroup the Creeks moved to the point of attack, 
and the Texas Cavalry lost 100 men and 200 were 
wounded. The Creeks torched the grass and the 
rest of the Texans panicked and the battle broke. 
Darkness found the Creeks still holding on. 
Opothleyahola ordered immediate evacuation of 
camp. They loaded their wagons and marched off. 

After three more encounters by the 
Confederates on their retreat to Kansas, 
Opothleyahola and his people fought their last 
battle at Chustenalaha on Shoal Creek in 
December. The loyal Indians were beaten; they 
scattered and retreated into the rough ground back 
of Shoal Creek. It was snowing and sleeting and 
the warriors and their families began their final 
retreat to Kansas. They traveled in small groups. 
Their final flight into Kansas and safe refuge was 
filled with horrors and their trail north was marked 
with frozen bodies. Of the Indians that did reach 
the refugee camp, many had frozen limbs. 
Opothleyahola, revered leader and shrewd military 
leader of the Creeks from 1830, died after they 
reached a place of safety in Kansas. 

After the Civil War ended in Indian Territory on 
September 8, 1865, the United States Government 
met with the Indians of Indian Territory at Fort 
Smith. Because of the treaties made with the 
Confederacy, the Indians of this region had 
endangered their treaties with the United States.

Now the United States President was anxious to 
renew the relations that existed before the war. 
There were seven conditions laid down by Dennis 
N. Cooley, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, when 
the tribes began to sign new treaties with the U. S. 
Government. They were to have permanent peace 
with each other and the United States. They were 
to aid in keeping peaceful relations with the Plains 
Indians and to form a single Indian government. 
They were to abolish slavery and incorporate their 
freedmen "on an equal footing with the original 

APPLICATION: 



members." Also a portion of the lands owned and 
occupied by their tribes must be set aside for the 
friendly tribes in Kansas and elsewhere. 

The war between the North and South, 
1861-1865, was a great misfortune for all the 
Indians in Indian Territory. The failure of the U. S. 
Government to settle the Jifferences between the 
two sides was not the fault of any Indian tribe. Yet 
the Indians living in what is now Oklahoma suffered 
more terrible losses than the white citizens in any 
part of the country.

How did the Indians who were involved in the Civil War dress? Did they wear uniforms 
like the Union and Confederate soldiers wore? 

Who were some other Indian leaders of the Civil War? Were they men who were leaders 
within the tribal groups before the war? Or did the war bring out leaders never known 
before? (Use the library to search for some answers.) 

What were the Indians' feelings about the Civil War? Was it their war? 

Find some Civil War stories involving the Indians. 

What kind of weapons were used during the Civil War? 



PERSONALIZATION : 

1 . Do you think the Indians in Oklahoma should have been involved in the Civil War when 
they were not living in what was called the United States, were not U. S. citizens, nor did 
they have the rights of citizens? 

2. Answer the following question as if you are an alien, not a U. S. citizen: Since you are 
living within our borders, and we are at war, will you defend the United States? 

EVALUATION: 

1. Indians of Oklahoma had to pledge their loyalties to either the North or the South. 
Consider the advantages and disadvantages of joining either side. 

2. Reflect upon the way the Civil War disrupted the lives of the Indians in what is now 
Oklahoma and the changes that were lasting and effective unto the present day. How 
did the Civil War affect your life by the changes that took place in the past?

THE MIAMI, QUAPAW, PEORIA AND WYANDOTTE 



CONCEPT: 

Although small in number, the Miami, Quapaw, Peoria and Wyandotte are still making history. 
PRESENTATION: 



The following short histories were taken from 
A History of Oklahoma, written by Joseph Thoburn 
in 1904: 

Quapaw 

Quapaw comes from the word "Aguapa" 
meaning "down stream people." The Quapaw are 
of the Siouan stock which is related to the Osage, 
Kaw, Omaha and Ponca. They were met in 
Arkansas in 1541 by DeSoto, who called them the 
Capaha. They early came under French influence 
and were generally at war with the Chickasaws, 
who lived on the opposite side of the Mississippi. 
In 1818 they sold most of their lands in Arkansas. 
A few years later part of them went to dwell with 
the Caddo on the Red River, but, finding that region 
not suited to their condition, they returned. After 
the settlement of the tribes from the east of the 
Mississippi in the Indian Territory, the Quapaw sold 
their reservation in Arkansas and moved to a new 
one within the present limits of Ottawa County, 
Oklahoma, where their descendants still live. As a 
tribe they are progressive and prosperous, even 
few in number as compared with their former 
strength. Today the tribe lives in and around 
Miami, Oklahoma. 

Peoria 

The Peoria is one of the five principal tribes of 
the Illinois Confederacy. They occupied a district 
in Central Illinois, along the Illinois River and about 
Peoria Lake. In common with the allied tribes they 
suffered from the hostility of the Iroquois during the 
latter half of the seventeenth century, and after 
Pontlac's war, from that of the tribes from the 
region of Lakes Michigan and Huron, also. Early in 
the nineteenth century the Peoria were consolidated 
with the Kaskaskia and Cahokla into one tribe or 
band. In 1832 this band moved to Kansas, where 
its numbers still continued to decrease. While living 
in Kansas they were consolidated with the Wea and 
the Plankeshaw. in 1867, the lands of this 



reservation having been sold, the Peoria moved to 
a new reservation adjoining that of the Quapaw in 
the Indian territory. The total number of Indians of 
the composite tribe, nearly all of mixed white blood, 
is not less than 200. 

Miami 

The Miami is an Algonquin stock, closely 
related to the Illinois tribes. When first met by the 
French about 1660, the Miami were living in 
southeastern Wisconsin, Thirty years later they 
moved southward, establishing themselves around 
the head of lake Michigan in Illinois, Indiana and 
Michigan. Still later they overran the valleys of the 
Nabash, the Maumee (Miami of the Lakes) and the 
Miami in Ohio. 

The Miami do not seem to have been as 
constant In their alliances and devotions as were 
many of the neighboring tribes, being favorable 
alternately to the interests of the French and the 
English. During the French and Indian War they 
sided with the French. Later, they joined Pontiac In 
his war against English expansion. During the 
American Revolution they sided with Great Britain 
against the Americans, and after the close of that 
war, continued to be hostile to the United States 
until they met with a decisive defeat by the forces 
under General Wayne in 1794. The celebrated war 
chief, Little Turtle, who led the Indians in the 
campaign which had resulted in the previous defeat 
of Generals St. Clair and Harmar, was a Miami, who 
ranked among the greatest Indian leaders in 
American history. 

In 1811 the Miami joined the movement of 
Tecumseh and were allied with the British during 
the war which followed. They then began to 
dispose of their lands in Indiana. In 1839 they 
agreed to accept a reservation in Kansas. To this 
reservation eight hundred of the Miami moved in 
1846, a smaller band remaining on a reservation in 
Wabash County, Indiana. In Kansas, the Miami 
continued to decrease in number, until finally one 
hundred and fifty survivors sold their lands in 1873,

and moved to a small reservation near that of their 
kinsmen of the federated Wea, Plankeshaw and 
Peoria, where the remnant of the tribe still lives, 
numbering fewer than one hundred persons. The 
Miami In Indiana now number about two hundred 
and fifty, nearly all of mixed white blood. 

Wyandotte 

Huron or Wyandotte comes from the French 
word *Hure" signifying "rough" or "uncouth," the 
application having been applied to rioters and 
rebels In France. The people of this tribe or 
confederation called themselves Wendat, the 
meaning of which is "islander," or "they who dwell 
on a peninsula." They were part of a confederation 
of four tribes from the Iroquois stock, whose 
domain was east of Lake Huron in Canada. 

The Wyandotte, or Huron Iroquois, were 
probably met by Jaques Cartier in the course of his 
voyages of exploration up the St. Lawrence River In 
1534 and 1543. At that time the Huron and the 
Iroquois tribes south of the St. Lawrence were at 
war. It was a war of extermination, apparently, the 
remnant of the Huron being driven northward and 
westward prior to the coming of Champlain In 1603. 
This war, waged by the Iroquois Five Nations of 
New York, continued till the Huron Iroquois were 
almost annihilated In 1648-50. The Iroquois of the 
Five Nations, having obtained firearms from the 
Dutch traders of New York, made quick work of 
their conquest. Few of the Huron escaped, and all 
of the captives not killed were absorbed or adopted 
into membership of the several tribes constituting 
the Five Nations. No matter which way they 
scattered and demoralized survivors fled, the 
relentless fury of the Iroquois Confederacy of the 
Five Nations followed. Indeed, for any other tribe 
to offer an asylum to the exiled Huron was to invite 
war with the Iroquois Confederacy. A small 
remnant of the Huron took refuge on Charity Island, 
Georgian Bay, but the sleepless Iroquois of New 
York would not let them remain there in peace. 
Next their flight led them out. They then retreated 
still farther westward to Manitoulin, then to 
Pottawatomie Island at the entrance to Green Bay 
on the western shore of Lake Michigan. The 

APPLICATION: 



Pottawatomie, an Algonquian tribe, and avowed 
enemies of the Five Nations, offered the fugitive 
Huron a refuge In their Wisconsin domain. Even In 
that far country the relentless hate of their old 
enemies still followed them, and, in addition, the 
jealousy of their new neighbors, the Sioux, was 
aroused. So, until a treaty was made between the 
French and the Iroquois Confederacy in 1666, the 
hunted Hurons found little rest. They then returned 
to Michllimacinac. All this time the French Catholic 
missionaries had followed the wandering Huron. 
Later on, the Huron established themselves at 
Sandusky, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; and Sandwich, 
Ontario. In 1747 the Huron, (then and since known 
as Wyandotte) under the leadership of their war 
chief, Orontony, acting probably under the 
inspiration of English agents, formed a league with 
a number of other western tribes for the purpose of 
driving the French out of the region of the Great 
Lakes. The plot was exposed, however, and, in the 
end, came to naught. The Huron, or Wyandotte, 
though few in numbers, soon attained a great 
degree of Influence among the tribes between the 
Great Lakes and the Ohio River, even outranking 
the Delaware In the inter-tribal councils. The 
Wyandotte supported the French during the French 
and Indian War, a part of their warriors being at the 
defeat of Braddock on the Monongahela. They 
also joined with Pontiac in his effort to dislodge the 
British from the Great Lakes. Thereafter they 
adhered to the British and were hostile to the 
Americans during the War for Independence. 
During the second war with Great Britain, the 
Wyandotte were divided, part of the tribe siding 
with the Americans and part with the British. By the 
Treaty of 1815 a large reservation was set aside for 
the Wyandotte in Northwestern Ohio and 
Southeastern Michigan. Part of this tract was sold 
by the Wyandotte in 1819 and the remaining 
portions were disposed of in 1842, shortly after 
which they moved to a reservation at the mouth of 
the Kansas River. By the Treaty of 1855 the 
Wyandotte became citizens, but twelve years later 
the tribal relations were re-established and the tribe 
moved to a small reservation in the northeastern 
part of the Indian Territory. The Wyandotte lands 
have been divided and allotted.

THE MODOC TRIBE OF OKLAHOMA 



CONCEPT: 

The Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma came from California following a series of dramatic events. 



PRESENTATION: 

The ancestral home of the Modoc people was 
some 5,000 square miles along both sides of what 
is now the California-Oregon border. While their 
tribal territory was small it was diverse. It had lofty 
forests on the north, jagged volcanic lava beds to 
the south, the Cascade mountains to the west, and 
a wilderness of alkali flats to the east. 

The Modoc were never a large tribe. The 
Modoc called themselves Maqlaqs, which meant 
"people" in their language. The Modoc were a 
migratory people who followed the seasons to 
obtain food. From prehistoric times dating back- 
some 15,000 years, the Modocs were a culturally 
isolated and distinctive people. 

The influx of non-Indians into the Pacific 
Northwest had a monumental impact on the culture 
and life of the Modoc. The roots of the Modoc War 
in 1873 extend back to the first penetration of 
non-Indians onto the ancestral homelands of the 
Modoc tribe. A tragic error of mistaken identity 
sparked a Modoc uprising. A man by the name of 
Ben Wright, a notorious Indian fighter, massacred 
43 of 46 unarmed Modoc under the white flag of 
truce. For six months, 57 Modoc warriors resisted 

APPLICATION: 



an army force of about 1000 men. The Modocs 
lost six men; the U. S. Army lost 45. The Modoc 
War cost the United States half a million dollars and 
the Modocs lost the war. 

The U. S. Commissioner of Indian Affairs 
decided to relocate the Modoc to the Quapaw 
Agency in Indian Territory in 1873. The death rate 
on the trip there was very high, in 1891 there were 
only 68 Modocs left. In 1909, after remaining 
prisoners-of-war for 36 years, the U. S. Government 
felt the Modoc had been punished enough and 
permitted them to return to their old home. Some 
did, others stayed in Oklahoma. The last full-blood 
Modoc person died in 1950. The Modoc Tribe of 
Oklahoma has achieved Federal recognition and is 
re-establishing a tribal land base here. While it is 
true that tribal rolls no longer carry the name of a 
fuil-blood Modoc, it is a tribute to their courage and 
determination (and perhaps ironically so) that 
despite General Sherman's desire and wish not to 
leave a Modoc man, woman, or child alive "so that 
the name Modoc would cease," the tribe has 
survived and is known far and wide. 



ACTIVITIES : 

1. As a class, look at and discuss the maps which are provided at the end of this lesson. 

2. Map skills development: On a large wall map, trace the movements of the Modoc tribe 
from their original homeland to their home in Oklahoma. Calculate approximately how 
many miles the Modoc people had to travel. 

3. Find out more about the Modoc people's 'Trail of Tears." 

4. Write to the Modoc Tribal Historian and ask for more information about the Modoc Tribe. 



25 



PERSONALIZATION : 

Write a short story describing how you might have felt, as a Modoc Indian person, before, during, 
and after your tribe's move to Indian Territory In what is now Oklahoma. Make up some imaginary 
happenings to make your story sound authentic. 

EVALUATION: 

Consider this question and write your response to it as a paragraph: Why is it that today there 
are no full-Wood Modoc people alive?

THE HISTORY OF THE OTTAWA TRIBE 



CONCEPT: 

The Ottawas have survived difficult and challenging events in the past. 
PRESENTATION: 



The first European recorded history of the 
Ottawa Tribe was by a French explorer, Samuel de 
Champlain, who first encountered these people 
near the mouth of Georgia Bay in 1615, in Canada. 
The Ottawas were known as 'traders" even before 
the Europeans arrived. The Algonquin word 
"Adawa" means trade or barter. The Ottawa were 
best known for their trading. Their canoes 
traversed the rivers of the Northeastern United 
States and Canada and the Great Lakes. 

The Ottawa share their language, heritage and 
lifestyle with other "Aigonquins." The Ottawas are 
closely related to the Chippewa and Pottawatomi 
tribes. 

The Ottawa Nation consists of five clans: The 
Otter, The Fork People, The Bear, The Grey 
Squirrel, and The Fish. The Ottawa Tribe of 
Oklahoma consists of The Otter and The Fork 
People clans. The other three clans who make up 
the rest of the Ottawa generally reside in the State 
of Michigan. 

The Ottawas, in the 1600's, made treaties with 
the French and the British. Treaties with the U. S. 
Government began in I785 at Fort Mcintosh in the 
Great Lakes Region. 

The Ottawas' most famous chief was Chief 
Pontiac. They fought against the British Army 
under General Braddock and defeated them. 
Pontiac also fought with the French. Pontiac had 
the greatest authority of any Indian chief on the 
continent. He was murdered or axed to death by 
another Indian who was bribed by an English 
trader. 

The Ottawas, under treaty with the U.S., were 
supposed to be left alone in peace on their own 
land for not entering the War of 1812. Instead, the 
Ottawas were forced to sign over their lands and 
forced to move to Kansas. During the first five 
years in Kansas, over half of the entire tribe died. 
The Ottawas had 74,000 acres of land in Kansas 
but this was opened for white settlement. The 



Ottawas sold this land and purchased land 
belonging to the Shawnees in Oklahoma - but now 
they only had 14,863 total acres. The Ottawas 
moved to their new land in Oklahoma in 1868-69. 

In 1901 the U. S. Congress granted citizenship 
to all Indians living in Indian Territory. In 1907, 
Indian Territory became the State of Oklahoma. In 
1908, an Act was passed to remove Indian land 
from trust status and open it to white purchasers 
who bought it. 

The Ottawa Tribe has struggled to survive 
through wars, starvation, and removal from their 
land when they were herded like cattle. At one 
time in history they were even told by the U. S. 
Government that they were no longer Indians 
(under the Truman and Eisenhower 
administrations). 

The Ottawas in Oklahoma form but a small 
fragment of the big Ottawa Tribe. There are about 
eight hundred Ottawas in Canada and nearly if not 
quite four thousand Ottawas in Michigan, so the 
entire Ottawa Tribe., if reunited, would include about 
five thousand ail told. The Ottawas have made 
their mark on the geography of the United States 
and Canada. Counties bearing the name of Ottawa 
are to be found in Kansas, Michigan, Ohio, 
Oklahoma, and in the Canadian province of 
Quebec, and towns by the same name in Illinois, 
Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Oklahoma, and 
Wisconsin, while the capital city of the Dominion of 
Canada is also called Ottawa. A bay, a beach, a 
lake, and a point or cape, all in Michigan, bear the 
name of Ottawa. There is an Ottawa River in 
Canada and another in Ohio, and there is a group 
of Ottawa Islands in Hudson's Bay. Finally, the 
name of the Ottawa Tribe is borne by the big 
Baptist University in Kansas, of which the tribe was 
a benefactor in its earlier days. Besides these, the 
maps of Michigan and Upper Canada are full of 
other names which have been derived from the 
Ottawa language.

SEMINOLE HISTORY 



CONCEPT: 



The Seminoles were once part of the Muskhogean people. 



PRESENTATION: 



The early history of the Seminoles is closely 
associated with that of the Creek tribe. The original 
Creek Confederacy, organized in Georgia and 
Alabama, perhaps with the ultimate design of 
forming an extensive Indian union against European 
invaders, contained 37 towns. The immediate 
purpose of Chief Old Brim, in 1716, was to 
strengthen his people for their war against the 
Cherokees and to provide a durable foundation for 
his "balance or power" policy. Old Brim understood 
the need of France, England, and Spain, In their 
long contest for territorial possessions, to have the 
friendship of Indian tribes In strategic locations; and 
he expected to find advantages for the Creeks in 
the diplomatic bids of the great powers for Indian 
support. Most of the peoples combined In the 
Creek Confederacy were Muskhogean, but a few 
bands of unrelated Indians, such as the Yuchi, were 
also incorporated. Tribes conquered by the Creeks 
were generally added to the Confederacy. 

The Seminoles began to be known by their 
present name around 1775. The Seminoles are a 
great people. No group of people has fought with 
more determination to retain their native soil, nor 
sacrificed so much to uphold the justice of their 
claims. Removal of the tribe from Florida to Indian 
Territory was the bitterest and most costly of all the 
Indian removals. The word Seminole is what the 
Creeks called the people who separated from the 
main tribe and located elsewhere. Seminoie means 
"run away" or "broken off." 

The Seminoles, after leaving the main tribe, 
moved into Florida, built homes, and began 
farming. Around this time, many of the slaves of 



the Colonists began running away and the 
Seminole tribe took them. This fostered hostilities 
between the tribe and the whites. This hostility 
resulted In the Seminole War of 1819. Many 
reports were given of the great fighting spirit of the 
Seminoles. It was stated that "the men never gave 
up." 

In 1819, a treaty was signed in which Spain 
ceded Florida to the United States. Soon 
afterwards the settlers began demanding to have 
the lands that the Seminoles occupied. A treaty 
was signed which gave the Seminoles mostly the 
swamp lands. Even then the Seminoles adapted to 
their environment. 

In 1830, the "Indian Removal Act" was signed 
by President Andrew Jackson. Soon a Seminole 
delegation was sent to Indian Territory to approve 
the new "lands" that were to be theirs. In three 
years, the Seminoles were to start this move to 
Indian Territory. At the and of the three years, 
there were objections to the removal prompting the 
second Seminole War which lasted seven years. 
The war ended in 1842 and the Seminoles were 
promised that several hundred members could 
remain in Florida. They stayed in the Florida 
swamps and never surrendered. Some of their 
descendants still live there today. 

By 1849, many of the Seminole tribal members 
were located In Indian Territory. In 1856, the 
Seminoles in Oklahoma agreed to a treaty stating 
they could have their own government and would 
be provided with land within the Creek Nation. The 
Seminole Nation of Oklahoma today is located in 
Wewoka in Seminole County, Oklahoma.

THE SENECA INDIANS 



CONCEPT: 

North American Indian people have survived the conquest of an entire hemisphere and live today 
in many places. 

PRESENTATION: 



Seneca Indians live today in Canada, New 
York, the Six Nations Reserve, and in Oklahoma. 
The Oklahoma Senecas arrived In Indian Territory 
around 1832. They left the northeast because 
alcohol was introduced into the tribe by settlers and 
they saw the bad effects that the drug was causing 
among their people. So, they left their fire and their 
wampum and traveled to Sandusky, Ohio in 1810 

APPLICATION: 



where they lived for about twenty years. When the 
wealth of the Sandusky rich farm land became 
known, the U. S. government removed some 3,000 
Senecas to Grove, Oklahoma so the settlers could 
have their Ohio land. Less than 2,000 survived this 
removal to Oklahoma. Today the Senecas and the 
Cayugas are enrolled together as a tribe in Miami, 
Oklahoma. 



ACTIVITIES : 

1. Identify on a United States map all the places Senecas are now living. 

2. Invite a Seneca resource person to your class to discuss further the history of the 
Senecas. 

PERSONALIZATION : 

Write a response to this question: How would you feel if you were forced to move from your 
homeland? 

EVALUATION: 

Take this short quiz over the presentation. 

1. Where do Seneca people live today? 

2. When did the Senecas arrive in Indian Territory? 

3. What connection do the Cayuga Indian people have with the Senecas of Oklahoma 
today?

ABOUT THE KAW TRIBE 



CONCEPT: 

The Kaws are a small, but proud, Indian tribe. 

PRESENTATION: 

The Kaw Tribe of Oklahoma: 
A Precious Breed 

Written by Jo Ann O'Bregon 

It was possibly the mid-1 6th century when the 
Kaw, or Kanza (meaning Wind People) came from 
the east and settled at the present site of Kansas 
City. 

Spanish Conquistadors from the Southwest 
had been turned back by what they considered the 
too harsh environment of the region. Early in the 
19th century major Stephen Long of the United 
States Army dismissed this land as The Great 
American Desert." These were oversimplified 
conclusions. Today this land is commonly known 
as the "Breadbasket of the World." It is only fitting 
that these Native Americans who Inhabited the 
eastern third of the region at the time of the white 
invasion were commonly designated The Wind 
People." There were and still are the Kaw Indians, 
a small but proud group of Dhegiaha-Siouans, 
whose cultural erosion at the hands of diverse white 
invaders seldom has been equaled, and whose 
name has undergone more changes in spelling and 
meaning than that of any other tribe west of the 
Mississippi. 

Even today, they display no particular concern 
over the fact that in 1673 Jacques Marquette's 
mapmaker recorded them as the Kansa Indians, or 
that in 1861 the State of Kansas took its name from 
this first irrefutable historical reference without 
obtaining their approval. 

A Baptist missionary and government surveyor 
reported in the 1830's that they chose to adhere to 
the pronunciation of the natives themselves, which 
is Hau-zau. n In conformity with this, a former 
government interpreter in the 1890's reported that 
the Kaws called themselves Konza, with the second 
syllable scarcely audible. Hence the use of the 
name Kaw. By the mid-1 9th century It was 
common practice for the Bureau of Indian Affairs to 
use Kaw in its official reports. 



In 1755 smallpox struck the tribe. By the end 
of the decade the number of Kaw males had been 
reduced 50 percent, and for the next century the 
tribe was chronically afflicted with this terrible 
disease. Government agents insisted that most of 
the tribe had been vaccinated for smallpox, yet the 
death of more than 400 in the epidemic of 1853- 
1855 tofd otherwise. The flood of 1844 destroyed 
the potential grain supply for the following winter. 
Exposure and malnutrition also took their toll. 

Today [in 1983] we have 837 members and 
only eight are full-Wood Kaw Indians - one woman 
and seven men. They are Lena Sumner Lockhard, 
Claremore, Oklahoma; Tomm Conn, El Reno, 
Oklahoma; Edgar Pepper, Tulsa, Oklahoma; Clyde 
Monroe, Kaw City, Oklahoma; William A. Mehojah, 
Sun Lakes, Arizona; Wayne Wynashe, Maywood, 
California; Jesse Mehojah, Jr., Tonkawa, 
Oklahoma; and Johnny Ray McCauley, Loyal, 
Oklahoma. 

Recently [1983], tribal members held a dinner 
to honor the remaining eight full-blooded Kaw 
Indians. We were contacted by an historical group 
from Council Groves, Kansas, who would like to 
have tribal members attend their First Annual 
Council Grove Wah-shun-gah Days. This 
celebration in to honor Chief Washunga of the Kaw 
Tribe. 

References about the Kaw Tribe were taken 
from a book called The Kaw People. It was written 
by William E. Unrau, Professor of History at Wichita 
State University. He has written another book, The 
Kansa Indians: A Hisiory of the Wind People, 1673- 
1873. 

I feel Mr. Unrau stated the Kaw people have 
been largely ignored by historians and anthropol- 
ogists. With his greatly appreciated help, the Kaw 
Indians now have two books written about them - 
and wont be lost forever. When our full-bloods are 
gone there will be information for the younger Kaws 
to pursue and pass on to their children. It is sad to 
think that in a few years, our full-bloods will be 
leaving us with only a memory. 



APPLICATION: 



ACTIVITIES : 

1 . Using Professor Unrai/s two books listed below, do further research on the Kaw Tribe. 
Learn additional Interesting information about this tribe. 

2. Invite a resource person to visit your classroom to discuss the history of the Kaw Tribe 
and to tell you about that tribe today. Perhaps this person could set up an Interview for 
your class with one of the few remaining full-blooded Kaw people. 

PERSONAUZATION : 

Mrs. O'Bregon states, 'It Is sad to think that In a few years, our full-bloods will be leaving us with 
only a memory." In a paragraph, explain what you think she means by that statement. 

EVALUATION: 

After completing your additional research on the Kaw Tribe, rewrite the presentation to Include 
other important Information about people, places, and events that you have learned about.

SOME EARLY OSAGE HISTORY 



CONCEPT: 

First seen by Europeans on the banks of the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers, the lifestyle of the 
Osage Indians was very similar to that of other native peoples, at that time in that area, before the 
invasion of the Europeans. 



PRESENTATION: 

The Osages say that at one time they resided 
on the banks of the Wabash and Ohio Rivers and 
also in the northern plains along the Missouri River. 
The first time Europeans ever saw the Osage 
Indians was on the western banks of the Mississippi 
River and the Missouri River in what Is now the 
State of Missouri. The Osages claimed territory 
west of the Mississippi between the Arkansas and 
Missouri Rivers west to what is now Dodge City, 
Kansas, and west to St. Joe, Missouri. 

The first Europeans to observe the Osage were 
French explorers, trappers, and missionaries. From 
the Osage's earliest recorded histories, a close 
friendship existed between the Osages and the 
French missionaries and traders. The French 
explorer, Father Marquette, learned about the 
Osages (WAH-SHA-SHE) from some other tribe 
(possibly the Otoe Tribe) before he reached the 
south of the Missouri River In 1673. 

The aboriginal name for the Osage Tribe was 
"NI-U-KON-SKA" which means "Children of the 
Middle Waters" or "Little Ones of the Middle 
Waters." Apparently the name, "Osage," is a 
corruption made by the early French traders of the 
tribe's name for itself: *WAH-SHA-SHE: Therefore, 
the word "Osage" Is really of French origin. The 
Osage Tribe is, as noted by paleoanthropologists, 
of the Siouan peoples and is classified in one group 
along with the Omaha, Ponca, Kansa (Kaw), and 

APPLICATION: 



Quapaw tribes. 

Washington Irving, in his four of the Prairies, 
described the Osages as "the finest looking Indians 
I have seen In the west. Despite the Osages' 
reputation for engaging in grim and brutal warfare, 
early travelers and missionaries were often treated 
with generosity, dignity, hospitality and sociai 
poise." 

It was the custom of the Osages to roam over 
a wide area on their hunting expeditions in pursuit 
of buffalo, deer, and antelope. They raised smali 
crops of corn, squash, and pumpkin, all of which 
were cultivated by the women and children. The 
buffalo was their mainstay for food, clothing, and 
shelter. 

The Osages suffered many hardships, like 
many other Indian tribes, as a result of aggressions 
of white settlers. One example occurred while the 
Treaty of March 27, 1 868 was under discussion with 
the U.S. government. The U.S. Indian Commission 
reported that when the Osages were out on their 
summer hunt, over 2,000 white settlers invaded the 
Osage reservation land, occupied their cabins and 
the already improved lands of the Osages, took 
over the Osage's corn fields, cattle and hogs, and 
threatened the lives of the few Osages when they 
came home. This action was allowed by the U.S. 
Government. 



A CTIVITIES : 

1 . On a large wall map, find the following places which were important to the Osage people 
in their earliest recorded history:

2. If from the earliest times, the Osages' name for themselves was "Children of the Middle 
Waters" or "Little Ones of the Middle Waters," what does this Indicate about the Osages' 
knowledge of North American geography? Why do you suppose that they referred to 
themselves as "Children" or "Little Ones"? 

3. Learn more about the early activities of the French explorers, trappers, and missionaries 
who came Into contact with the Osages and other native tribes along the Missouri and 
Mississippi Rivers. 

PERSONALIZATION : 

In one or two paragraphs, describe how you might have felt as an Osage person in 1868 when 
you returned from your summer hunt and found 2,000 non-indian settlers living on your 
reservation. 

EVALUATION: 

As a class, list on the chalkboard what tends to happen when two entirely different groups of 
people come Into contact with one another. Using the French and Osage peoples as an example, 
list some probable interactions which took place between them.

SOME LATER OSAGE HISTORY (1803-1907) 



CONCEPT: 

Under the directive of the powerful U.S. government, the Osages had to move westward, like many 
other tribes, and change their government which had been in existence for hundreds of years. 

PRESENTATION: 

In 1803, the U.S. purchased from France the 
territory extending west from the Mississippi River 
to the Rocky Mountains between the Mexican and 
Canadian borders. This transaction, caiied the 
Louisiana Purchase, cost the U.S. $15 million. 

Immediately after the Louisiana Purchase, 
white settlers began their westward movement. 
Called "pioneers", these people did not recognize 
the Indian people's right to ownership of this land. 
As a result, these pioneers settled upon thousands 
of acres of Indian lands. 

In order to make all of this legal the U.S. 
government made treaties with the Indians for the 
possession of their lands. In many cases, these 
treaties were forced upon the Indian peoples. The 
Osage Nation ended up ceding the foliowing lands 
to the U.S. government: 

Treaty of 1808 = 50 million acres 
Treaty of 1818 = 1.8 million acres 
Treaty of 1825 = 45 million acres 

TOTAL = 96.8 million acres 

As compensation for this cession, the Osages 
received $166,300 In cash. This represents a 

APPLICATION: 

ACTIVITIES : 

1 . As a class go outside and physically see the dimensions and size of six acres of land. 
Get some kind of an Idea as to how much that amount of land would be worth today. 

2. Contact the Osage County Historical Society (Pawhuska, Oklahoma 74056) to get 
some further historical information about Osage County. 

3. In a class discussion, discuss the kind of impact all that moving farther and farther to 
the west probably had on the Osages and other tribes. How did it make them feel? 
How did it affect their customs, traditions, and ways of life? 



4. Learn more about the Louisiana Purchase and how it affected Indian tribes whose 



payment to the Osages by the U.S. government of 
about one penny for each six acres of land ! 

Like many other tribes, the Osages were 
forced to move westward, In 1865, the Osages 
sold their land in Kansas for cash money. On June 
14, 1883, the Osages paid $1,099,137.41 to the 
Cherokee Nation for the land which now forms 
Osage County in Oklahoma. This represented a 
valid monetary transaction between two sovereign 
nations of people. The reason for this transaction 
was because in the years 1871 and 1872, the 
Osages were removed to a reservation in Indian 
Territory described and confirmed to them by an 
Act of Congress on June 5, 1872. Some ten years 
later they formally bought this land from the 
Cherokee Nation. 

The Osages, at that time, were forced to 
pattern their tribal government after that of the "Five 
Civilized Tribes." Although later changed by the 
U.S. Secretary of the Interior, the tribe had to 
change their tribal government in order to be 
recognized by the U.S. government. When 
Oklahoma was admitted as a State in 1907, the 
Osage Reservation became Osage County - 
Oklahoma's largest county having 1 ,470,559 acres 
of land.

was the situation? Who was doing the forcing? How did this make you feel? How did you 
handle the situation? In a short paragraph, explain this situation In detail. 




EVALUATION: 

In your opinion, did the Osages and other similar tribes really have any choice In the matter but 
to move west as the U. S. government directed? Why or why not?

BACKGROUND OF THE OTOE-MISSOURIA TRIBE 



CONCEPT: 

The Otoe-Missouri, and Iowa tribes have had a strong, lasting association over many years. 



PRESENTATION: 

The Otoe-Missouria Tribe currently is located 
in Red Rock, Oklahoma, and has a population of 
some 1 ,500 members. The majority of the tribe still 
lives in the Red Rock area since being removed to 
there in 1881 from Nebraska. The following history 
of the tribe was provided by the Nebraska Indian 
Commission: 

The Missouri and Otoe tribes, proud and 
Independent woodland nations, never envied the 
plains tribes nor their environment. Their eastern 
homelands were abundant with game and wild 
vegetation, fish, and fertile soil. Prior to the 
settlement of the new world, great herds of buffalo 
reached into Indiana and Illinois. 

However, following the American Revolution, 
Lewis and Clarks' report of the boundless beauty 
and plenty of the west attracted vast numbers of 
white settlers. Greed among both Indians and 
whites coupled with cultural differences combined 
to force the Otoe and Missouri tribes from their 
ancestral homes. Although neither of the tribes 
were native to Nebraska, bands from each tribe 
resided in south-eastern Nebraska during the 
1800's. By the time the tribes had come to 
Nebraska, they would be recognized as one tribe - 
the Otoe-Missouri. For over a century, these tribes 
were either forced or Induced to move in the wake 
of the steady migration of settlers. Their Nebraska 
residency would be abruptly terminated prior to the 
turn of the century. The following narrative further 
describes the history of the Otoe-Missouri people. 

During the I7th Century, both the Missouri and 
the Otoe tribes belonged to the Winnebago tribe. 
The Winnebago were one of the Slouan tribes of 
the midwestern woodlands. During the early 
1600's, both Winnebago bands separated from the 
tribe. Neither the Otoe nor the Missouri were a 
particularly large tribe as neither numbered many 
over 1,000 people. 

Upon their separation from the Winnebagoes, 
the Otoe located In proximity to the Iowa tribe (near 
the present adjoining corners of the states of 
Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Iowa, along the 



Mississippi River). The first recorded contact with 
whites In that region occurred around the middle of 
the I7th Century. The Great Lakes region was 
frequented by French and British fur traders, 
trappers, and explorers in search of furs and a 
northwest passageway to China. 

Written accounts referred to these closely 
related tribes - the Otoe, Missouri, and Iowa - as 
"sedentary tribes that grow crops." The depletion 
of game and consequently furs in eastern woodland 
regions drove the Iroquois west in search of more

abundant game. However, the land was already 
occupied by other tribes such as the Miami, 
Shawnee, Illinois, Winnebago, and Sac and Fox. 
The Iroquois were not intimidated as their large 
population, in addition to their wealth of guns and 
ammunition obtained from traders in the east over 
the past years, accounted for their military 
superiority. They often attacked smaller tribes 
severely ill-equipped to fight the powerful Iroquois. 
Whereas some tribes were relatively successful in 
holding their own against invading eastern tribes, 
smaller tribes such as the Otoe and the Missouri 
were driven westward across the Mississippi River. 

Bordering the plains, the woodland tribes were 
forced to adapt to their new environment. Although 
they buWt permanent villages, these tribes were 
forced to go on hunts as the buffalo increasingly 
became more important to their survival. Their 
buffalo hunts often took them Into Sioux territory 
which did little to improve relations between the 
plains tribes and woodland tribes. According to 
Sioux tradition, Otoe territory extended north along 
the Mississippi to the Minnesota River. However, 
continued pressure from the iroquois in the east 
drove other tribes deeper west, such as the Illinois, 
who in turn pushed the Otoe, Iowa, and Missouri 
people farther west and south into the current state 
of Iowa. Written accounts of the late 1600's state 
that neither the Otoes, lowas nor Missouris were 
very warlike or aggressive. 

At the beginning of the 18th Century, the 
Missouri Tribe settled near the mouth of the 
Missouri River. The Missouri, Iowa and Otoe tribes 
were the target of raiding eastern tribes from across 
the Mississippi. Not only were furs profitable, but 
captured Indians were needed to supplement the 
flourishing European slave market. As it became 
increasingly difficult to protect the tribe from such 
disruptions and raids from the east, a portion of the 
Otoes joined the Missouris on the banks of the 
Missouri River. The rest of the Otoe tribe moved to 
the southeastern corner of Nebraska around the 
Platte and Nemaha Rivers, near the present site of 
Ashland. The move occurred around the beginning 
of the 1700's. Other Otoe villages were located 
near the present-day towns of Yutan, Bellevue and 
Plattsmouth. They soon copied the earthen lodges 
used by their Pawnee neighbors as their bark 
lodges were impractical. 

Around 1 798, the Sac and Fox attacked the 
Missouri encampment and nearly decimated the 
tribe. Soon thereafter, the Osage delivered the last 
and nearly fatal blow to the tribe. Their defeat to 
the Osage signified an end of the Missouri's 



existence as an independent tribe. Survivors joined 
either the lowas or the Otoes. Following the turn of 
the century, the Otoe name was commonly used to 
refer to the Missouri and the Otoe tribes. 

The two tribes may have moved far enough 
west to escape the reach of the Iroquois but they 
couldn't move fast enough and far enough to 
escape the Increasing number of white settlers. 
The two tribes occupied the most wooded section 
of Nebraska - perhaps the most attractive for 
settlement. Succumbing to pressures of the 
increasing number of settlers, the initial cession of 
Otoe land around the Big and Little Nemaha 
occurred in 1830, Three years later, lands around 
Lincoln and 25 miles to the west were likewise 
ceded. Eighteen fifty-four marked the final 
negotiation conducted by Otoe chief Stay-By-It. All 
tribal lands were ceded save for 162,000 acres 
which presently comprise Gage County, Nebraska. 

Following the Civil War, the pressure for 
removal was further intensified. White settlers 
made Nebraska such an unfriendly and potentially 
dangerous place for the tribe to live that they were 
for the most part willing to move on to Indian 
Territory in Oklahoma. But not all of the Otoes 
were convinced that removal would be in their best 
interest. Consequently the tribe split intc factions, 
divisions which would plague most tribes faced with 
Voluntary removal. 14 The "Quaker Band" of ths tribe 
did not feel that removal would solve anything and 
felt that they were better off where they were. The 
pro-removai group, known as the Coyote or Wild 
Party were in favor of removal in exchange for 
acreage in Indian Territory and government 
annuities. In 1881, the government made an offer 
the tribes couldn't refuse. The tribe voted to accept 
the Congressional provision for the sale of their 
lands and removal to Indian Territory to a site near 
what is today Stillwater, Oklahoma. The govern- 
ment conducted the sale of the tribes' Nebraska 
land. Settlers generally paid 75 cents an acre for 
land that normally sold for $3.00 per acre. Neither 
were payments always made to enrolled tribal 
members or Otoes of at least a quarter Otoe blood. 
Consequently, the tribe filed a claim against the 
government for the 1854 cession. In 1964, they 
were awarded a million dollars to compensate for 
the government's fraudulent sale of their lands. 

Chief Stay-By-It, along with several other Otoe 
and Missouri tribal leaders traveled to Washington, 
D.C. to conclude treaty negotiations in March of 
1854. The tribes not only ceded all but a small 
tract of their land, but acknowledged "their 
dependency on the Government of the United

States." Unique to their treaty was a provision 
against the Introduction of liquor for sale or 
consumption on the reservation.

THE PAWNEE TRIBE OF NORTH-CENTRAL OKLAHOMA 



CONCEPT: 

The Pawnee Tribe is one* of the oldest tribes on the prairie. 
PRESENTATION: 



The Pawnee tribe has a long and proud history 
that goes back over seven hundred years and a 
mysterious past ranging back into antiquity that 
probably wHI never be known for sure. The Pawnee 
Indian Nation boasts a proud heritage as a free and 
fiercely independent people with a distinctive 
culture and rich tradition. Today [1983], there are 
2,248 Pawnees currently enrolled on the official 
Pawnee Tribal Roll. From a population of over 
1 0,000 in 1 800, they dwindled to about 500 in 1 900. 
A great loss of life occurred as the Pawnees were 
stricken with smallpox and cholera. The Pawnees 
were centered chiefly in Nebraska, near and about 
the Piatt, the Republican, and the Loup rivers. The 
four confederated bands of the Pawnee are the 
Chaul, "Grand"; the KJtkehalki, "Republican"; the 
Pitahaueratah, Tappage"; and the Skldlkl, "Wolf." 

There was a legend concerning the explorers 
Lewis and Clark and the Pawnee villages in 
Nebraska in 1804-1805. The explorers found that 
the Spanish flag was flying over Pawnee villages. 
The Americans explained that the United States 
now owned the Louisiana Purchase The Pawnee 
people did not realize that Spain had returned the 
Louisiana Purchase to France, thus the Spanish flag 
was still flying. Many Pawnee people did not want 
to Join the United States. A council meeting was 
called and finally after two days of discussion, the 
Spanish flag was lowered and the United States 
flag was raised. 

The Pawnee origin is debated. It Is felt that 
they may have come from the southeast or 
southwest if not by 1541 at least by the early 
1600's. Some historians feel the Pawnee did not 
migrate from another region but evolved from the 
Upper Republican cultures of the era between 1200 
and 1500 A.D. The Department of Archeology of 
the University of Oklahoma claims that the Pawnee 
Tribe may be the oldest tribe on the prairie. They 
believe that the Pawnee may have stopped to stay 
with the Pueblos. The above statement agrees with 
an old legend that the Pueblo and Pawnee are 
"brothers." Further, before stopping to be with the 
Pueblo, they wandered in from Old Mexico. Ills

said that Coronado had a Pawnee with him in 1543. 
The Pawnee was called The Turk." Coronado was 
searching for the seven cities of Cibola. The Turk 
led them a merry chase across the prairies. It is 
thought that at this time some horses escaped from 
Coronado's expedition. A French explorer in 1620 
saw Pawnee Indians in Arkansas equipped with 
horses. The horse gave the Pawnee the mobility 
that made them a name to be feared by their 
enemies. It Is known that they raided even in Old 
Mexico In their frequent search for horses. The 
Pawnee culture at that time embraced life styles 
from the nomadic plains tribes and the farming 
tribes of the eastern plains. 



31 



The Pawnee ceded ail their lands to the United 
States In 1833, 1848, 1857 and 1872. They moved 
from Nebraska to the Pawnee County area of 
Oklahoma in 1875. The Pawnee Indian Agency was 
established just east of the present city of Pawnee 
and an Indian boarding school was built at the 
agency on land now known as the Pawnee Tribal 
Reserve. The name of the school was the Pawnee 
Industrial School. The children were taught the 
following pursuits: farming, care of stock, working 
in the laundry and kitchen, sweeping school rooms 
and dormitories, preparing wood for use, repairing 
buildings and fences. The average attendance 
during the early years was about 95 - equally 
divided between boys and gills. The school closed 
in 1958 and the land was returned to the Pawnee 
Tribe in 1968. Today, the old Indian school is 
undergoing renovation. The school building, 
completed in 1932, is now the Pawnee Tribal 
Administration Center; however, the Pawnee Tribal 
Business Council has leased this building to the 

APPLICATION: 



Bureau of Indian Affairs, Pawnee Agency. 

The Pawnee Tribal Business Council is the 
supreme governing body of the Pawnees. Council 
members are elected every two years. Council 
members elect their own officers. A Tribal 
Chairman is also elected. 

According to Muriel Wright, an Indian historian: 
The Pawnee were notable for their tribal religion, 
rich in myth, symbolism, and poetic fancy, with 
elaborate rites and dramatic ceremonies connected 
with the cosmic forces and heavenly bodies... 
religious beliefs were highly integrated with most of 
the tribal institutions and practices... personal 
characteristics for which the Pawnee have always 
been known: courage, loyalty, and respect for 
authority... From the time that their country was 
taken over in the Louisiana Purchase, the Pawnee 
never made war on the United States and Pawnee 
scouts served faithfully and courageously in the 
United States Army in Indian wars."

PONCA HISTORY 



CONCEPT: 

There is more to a treaty than a piece of paper. 
PRESENTATION: 



The following information was prepared by the 
Nebraska Indian Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska: 

Part I: 

The first treaty between the Poncas and the 
United States was signed in 1817. As characteristic 
of the treaties negotiated during the early 1800's, 
the treaty documented the "peace and friendship" 
between the two nations. In 1825, a second treaty 
was signed. By agreeing to the treaty, the Poncas 
acknowledged that they lived within the "territorial 
limits of the United States" thereby recognizing the 
supremacy of the government. The Poncas also 
authorized the government to regulate ell trade and 
commerce. 

A third treaty, signed in 1858, nullified the 
Poncas' title to all their lands occupied and claimed 
by them "except for a small portion on which to 
colonize and domesticate them." Intense preoccu- 
pation with the slavery issue during the years prior 
to the Civil War diverted Congressional attention 
from treaty ratification. The provisions guaranteed 
by the government in the treaty were similar to 
other treaties in that promises were only partially 
kept or not kept at all. For example, the 1858 
treaty promised the Ponca's government protection 
from the Sioux, nearly half a million dollars for 
establishing a school, grist mill, mechanic shop and 
the purchase of stock and farm implements in 
addition to technical assistance. Believing the 
government would honor its treaty promises^he. 
Poncas abandoned their lands and withdrew to the 
small tract of land defined by the treaty. 

Months passed without the Senate's 
ratification. Consequently, the tribe was left without 
means to plant and cultivate crops and means to 
hunt game as the Sioux controlled their former 
hunting grounds. The tribe was left with little 
choice but to return to their former lands which had 
subsequently been settled by a number of whites. 
Historians agree that the government's failure to 
uphold the treaty provisions voided the treaty and 
authorized the tribe to return to their former lands. 



However, the government quickly intervened and 
provided emergency supplies. The Senate finally 
ratified the treaty In 1859. 

Treaty ratification, however, did not insure 
delivery of the treaty's provisions. The limited 
supplies provided by the government were not 
adequate to combat the series of drought, scarcity 
of buffalo and frequent raids by the Sioux. A 
supplementary treaty between the Poncas and the 
government was signed in 1865. The treaty 
extended the Ponca reservation down the Niobrara 
to the Missouri River and authorized $15,000 for 
losses suffered at the hands of army personnel who 
had harassed, robbed and killed several women 
and children returning from a visit to an Omaha 
camp where they had obtained food for their family. 
Like the previous treaty, the Senate did not ratify 
the treaty for another two years. 

On their journey westward in 1804, Lewis and 
Clark came upon the Ponca tribe. The Poncas 
were a small tribe, numbering approximately 700 
during the early 1800's. Lewis and Clark reported 
that the tribe, once a part of the Omaha tribe, 
separated and lived along a branch of the Red 
River near Lake Winnipeg. However, the Sioux 
forced the Poncas, as many of the smaller plains 
cultures, to relocate to the west bank of the 
Missouri River in the early 1700's. 

Because of the Poncas' limited population, 
they were subject to both the Sioux and the 
advancing wave of white settlers. However, the 
Poncas did not engage in any wars or other armed 
conflict after 1825. Nor do records exist showing 
that any member of the Ponca tribe ever ki'led 
white settlers or soldiers. 

Part II: 

In 1876, the government formulated a policy to 
consolidate as many tribes as possible in Indian 
Territory in Oklahoma. Tribes that traditionally 
offered the least resistance to the whim? of the 
government and had been cooperative were, 
ironically, the first to be offered inferior acreage in 



ERLC

Oklahoma and eventually forced to move. The 
Ponca tribe was approached by a government 
agent who offered to take the Ponca chiefs to 
Oklahoma to look over several alternative 
reservation sites. Prior to their departure, the agent 
promised the Chiefs that if they didn't like the land 
they saw they could return to their Nebraska home. 
Ten Ponca chiefs made the journey to Indian 
territory, visiting three different land reserves which 
were equally barren and unsuitable for agriculture. 

The chiefs agreed not to exchange their lands 
and to return home. Upon informing the agent of 
their decision, the agent threatened to withdraw all 
money and support including the interpreter. The 
chiefs stubbornly refused to relinquish their 
Nebraska homeland so the agent departed without 
the Ponca chiefs. The chiefs, some of whom were 
advanced in years and ill, were forced to make their 
journey in the middle of winter without money, food 
or an interpreter. Fifty days later, near starvation, 
the Ponca chiefs reached the Oto reservation along 
the Kansas-Nebraska border. The Otoes provided 
them with enough food and ponies to make their 
way back to Niobrara. When the chiefs reached 
home, they found their people already preparing for 
the move. Federal troops were called in to enforce 
the removal orders. 

The long march took a heavy toll on the tribe, 
over half of whom were women and children. 
Storms, poor road and traveling conditions greatly 
impeded their journey and caused much suffering 
and death. Standing Bear's daughter was among 
those who died along the way. 

The tribe arrived in Oklahoma only to discover 
that the government had failed to secure food and 
shelter for the Poncas. Many people died during 
the tribe's first year in Oklahoma. Within a year of 
their departure from Nebraska, one hundred and 
fifty-eight Poncas had died. Standing Bear spoke 
of the tragic circumstances. 

Shortly thereafter, Standing Bear organized 
thirty of his people to return to Nebraska. In 
January of 1879, Standing Bear led his people 
home with only four wagons and twenty dollars in 
cash. Sympathetic farmers provided food and 
shelter along the way. When they arrived at the 
Omaha reservation, their friends gave them land for 
them to farm. Federal troops were sent to retrieve 
Standing Bear and his band. They were 
subsequently arrested and imprisoned at Fort 
Omaha until they were to be returned to Indian 
territory. 

General Crook, Omaha commander, did 
everything he could to delay the Poncas' return to 



Oklahoma. He allowed reporter Thomas Tibbies to 
interview Standing Bear and other Ponca leaders. 
Tibbie's articles were telegraphed to the east coast. 
Local churches sent letters and telegrams to the 
Secretary of Interior urging him to reverse his 
decision to return the Poncas to Oklahoma. As a 
reporter for the Omaha World Herald, Tibbies 
publicized the plight of the Poncas and enlisted the 
assistance of two attorneys. Standing Bear's 
attorneys contended that the I4th Amendment 
entitled Indians the right to file a writ of habeas 
corpus in federal court. (A writ of habeas corpus is 
filed when it can be shown that a person has been 
deprived of his "natural, inherent and Inalienable 
right" of liberty.) The government argued that 
Indians were not recognized as persons within the 
context of the law and therefore were not entitled to 
bring suit against the government. 

Standing Bear's attorneys also questioned the 
government's authority to remove Indians from one 
place to another during times of peace. 

Part III: 

United States District Judge, Elmer S. Dundy, 
began the court hearing on Standing Bear's case in 
April of 1879, The two day trial attracted national 
attention. Standing Bear significantly contributed to 
his own defense through his eloquent testimony. 
After hearing the attorneys' argument, Judge Dundy 
permitted Standing Bear to speak. Extending his 
hand toward the judge, Standing Bear said: 

That hand is not the color of yours, but if 
I pierce it, I shall feel pain. If you pierce 
your hand you also fee! pain. The blood 
that will flow from mine will be of the 
same color as yours. I am a man. The 
same God made us both. 

The following day, Judge Dundy rendered a 
decision which recognized the Indian as a person 
under the meaning of the laws of the United States. 
Therefore, that person has the right to file a writ of 
habeas corpus against the government. The judge 
also concluded that General Crook, i.e. the United 
States government, did not possess the authority to 
forcibly remove any tribe to Indian territory. 
Consequently, Judge Dundy discharged Standing 
Bear and his people from custody freeing them to 
go wherever they desired. 

Although a portion of their Nebraska homeland 
was reinstated, only half of the tribe returned to 
their previous home. Poverty and disease would

continue to take their toll over the years. Unity 
between the two Ponca groups became increasing- 
ly difficult to maintain. Today, the Ponca Tribe of 
Oklahoma lives in a small community called White

ACTIVITIES : 

1. Have a class discussion of Part i of the Presentation. Were the Poncas treated "fairly" 
by the U.S. government? 

2. Reread Part II of the Presentation. Students should each draw a picture depicting a 
portion of this story. Have each write a sentence describing their picture. Combine 
sentences and pictures into a class bulletin board. 

3. Copy Standing Bear's famous quotation on the chalkboard. Practice reading it together 
as a class. Now review the actual circumstances surrounding where and when this 
speech was given. Have volunteers give this speech using the tone of voice and 
movements they feel Standing Bear might have used. 

PERSONALIZATION : 

What part of the history of the Ponca Tribe did you personally find to be the most interesting? 
Write it down on a small piece of paper. Everyone should now put their slips of paper into a box 
or hat. Have someone pick a slip of paper from the hat and read it aloud. When your interesting 
Ponca Tribe concept is read, be prepared to tell the class why it was interesting to you. 

EVALUATION: 

Discuss the meaning of this lesson's concept: 'There is more to a treaty than a piece of paper."

THE TONKAWAS OF OKLAHOMA 



CONCEPT: 



Texas was once the home of the Tonkawas. 
PRESENTATION: 

Tonkawa is from the Waco word "tonkawea" 
meaning "staying together." The Tonkawa people 
call themselves Titskan-Watich, meaning 
"indigenous men." 

In historical accounts before the late 18th 
Century, the Tonkawa as a whole are not 
discussed. Instead various "sub-tribes," each with 
its own designation, are listed. These include the 
Tonkawa proper, the Mayeye, the Yojucane, and 
the Ervipiame. According to mission records, these 
four groups spoke the Tonkawan language. By the 
end of the 18th century, the various Tonkawan 
groups began to be considered as a ngle tribe 
called the Tonkawa. In 1782, some of the 
Tonkawas were receiving stolen horses from the 
Lipan and other eastern Apache tribes, giving them 
in exchange firearms obtained from the French. 
But during the next decade the Tonkawa became 
engaged in wars against the Lipan and stole horses 
from them. 

During the first decade of the I9th century, the 
Tonkawa Indians were generally found in the area 
between the Trinity and San Antonio rivers in Texas. 
According to one report, 250 families regularly 
moved back and forth between the Brazos and San 
Marcos rivers; a few were also reported near the 
Red River at this time. In the 1820's, Tonkawa 
Indians again were living along the middle and 
lower reaches of the Guadalupe, Colorado, and 
Brazos rivers. It was during this period that the 
Tonkawa came to be closely -associated with a 
segment of the Lipan Apache tribe. (Hereafter 
portions of these tribes were frequently living near 
or with one another.) 

During the early 1820's, the Tonkawas on the 
lower Colorado and Brazos rivers had so annoyed 
the American settlers that the latter assembled all 
the Tonkawa living in that vicinity at a place on the 
Colorado River preparatory to moving them out of 
the white settlements. At this point, a Lipan chief 
arrived with a letter from Stephen F. Austin stating 
that the Lipan Apache had agreed to take charge of 
the Tonkawa. The Lipan reportedly took them out 
of the white settlement to an area between the 



upper Neuces and the Rio Grande Rivers. The 
Tonkawa remained there for a few years and then 
drifted back toward the coast. 

In the next decade, the 1830's, the Lipan and 
Tonkawa jointly raided white settlements and the 
camps of other Indians for horses. They also aided 
the whites in campaigns against a number of tribes 
and were known to have hunted together with 
whites between the Brazos and Colorado rivers. 

The 1840's was a period of considerable 
disorganization among many of the Texas Indian 
tribes, including the Tonkawa. A large number of 
Tonkawa were decimated in a serious epidemic in 
1843, and others were killed in the continuing 
intertribal conflicts. During this decade the 
Tonkawa Indians, together with some of the Lipan, 
fought on the side of the Texans in the war with 
Mexico. Although the Tonkawa moved about 
considerably during this period, the greater part of 
the tribe seems to have been concentrated between 
the Colorado and the Rio Grande rivers generally 
toward the Gulf Coast. 

The next decade, the 1859*s, found the 
Tonkawa Indians gravitating toward various centers, 
although a few small groups were stilt scattered 
about Texas. As a result of their becoming 
increasingly destitute, a number of individuals 
sought food and shelter from American military 
establishments in southern Texas, particularly Fort 
Inge and Fort Clark. But by mid-1855, most of 
them had been sent to the Brazos Agency on the 
main fork of the Brazos River. The Indians at this 
agency - Caddo, Tawakoni, Waco, Kichai, 
Shawnee, Delaware, Anadarko, and Tonkawa - 
continued to hunt in the surrounding area. They 
began to incur the wrath of white settlers, who 
blamed them for many of the "depredations" which 
had taken place. As a result, these tribes (including 
about 245 Tonkawa) were removed from Texas in 
the year 1859 and settled at the Wichita Reserve, 
near Fort Cobb, on the north side of the Washita 
River, in Indian Territory. 

Few of the activities of the Tonkawa between 
1 860 and 1 880 were recorded. The Tonkawa at the 



ERLC 



38 



50 



Wichita Reserve remained there after the outbreak 
of the Civil War, even though some of the other 
tribes at the reservation fled to Kansas. In 1862 
occurred the "Great Massacre" of the Tonkawa by 
other tribes at the Reserve. Many conflicting 
reasons have been given for this attack, in which 
more than one-half of the Tonkawa present were 
reportedly kilied. Some of the survivors fled to 
nearby Fort Arbuckle, where they stayed for a short 
time; then in 1863 they drifted back to Fort Belknap 
in northern Texas. Afterwards some of the 
Tonkawa moved into the Waco area in central 
Texas and lived on or near the premises of their 
former Indian agent, Captain Shapley P. Ross. 
They remained there until about 1866. 

By 1872, Tonkawa Indians were reported 
about Fort Griffin and in other parts of northern 
Texas; here some Individuals served as scouts, 
guides, and spies for the American soldiers. In 

APPLICATION: 



1874, rumors were heard that the Comanche and 
the Wichita were planning another "massacre" of 
the Tonkawa, who were then given the protection 
of the soldiers at Fort Griffin and were provided 
with food, clothing, livestock, and agricultural 
implements. By 1876 a few Lipan Apache Indians 
had been settled with them at the Fort, and after 
1 878 the Lipan almost invariably are mentioned with 
the Tonkawa. These gradually came to be 
considered as a single unit. 

The Tonkawa-Lipan group remained in the 
vicinity of Fort Griffin until October, 1884, when 
most of them were removed to Oklahoma. These 
Indians were first placed on the Iowa Reservation, 
but in June, 1885, they were permanently settled at 
the Oakland Agency on the west side of the 
Chikaskia River in the northeastern part of 
Oki homa. Today many of their descendants are 
living near the town of Tonkawa, Oklahoma.

HISTORICAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE SHAWNEE TRIBE 



CONCFPT: 

The Shawnees had a long history before coming to Oklahoma. 
PRESENTATION: 



Originally the Shawnees lived in the Ohio River 
Valley In what is now southern Ohio, northeastern 
Kentucky, and neighboring areas. Here they were 
living In the 1600's. In 1648, they were mentioned 
as "Ouchaouanag" the word for Shawnee among 
the northern tribes, notable the Ottawa. In 
language and culture they were quite close to the 
Kickapoo, Miami, Sauk, Fox, and Illinois tribes. In 
fact, the Kickapoos and the Shawnees share a 
tradition of once being one tribe. 

Due to warfare caused by the coming of the 
white people, the Shawnee Tribe scattered after 
1660, settling as far apart as the Tallapoosa River in 
Alabama; the Savannah River (named for the 
Shawnees) in South Carolina; and the 
Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania. After 1 730, the 
Shawnee Tribe resettled in Ohio and Kentucky. In 
the 1770s, white colonists took over Kentucky, and 

APPLICATION: 



then they started taking the land of the Indians !n 
Ohio. This resulted in a war between the Indians 
and the white people which raged off and on from 
1774 to 1795. The Shawnee Tribe lost many 
people in this war, and parts of the Tribe began 
leaving Ohio. In 1800, four Shawnee villages 
known as "Pekowitha" "Kispokotha" "Thawekila" 
and "Chalakatha" were in Missouri and southern 
Illinois, while other groups known as "Mekocheki, 
*Wakatameki" "Chalakatha" and "Pekowitha" were 
living on three reservations in Ohio and on nearby 
lands in Indiana. 

The Shawnees were removed by the U. S. 
government to Kansas and later to Oklahoma. 
Three bands of the Shawnee exist today: the 
Absentee Shawnee, the Loyai Shawnee, and the 
Eastern or Cherokee Shawnee. 



ACTIVITIES : 

(More information about the Shawnees is included in some of these activities.) 

1. Reread the presentation and answer the following questions. 

a. Where were the Shawnee people from originally? 

b. In language and culture, what tribes are the Shawnee people close to? 

c. What happened to the Shawnee people from 1600-1700? 

d. Where were the Shawnee people living In the 1800's? 

e. Today where are the Shawnee people living? 

2. Read the following paragraph while students trace on a map the movement of the 
Shawnee tribe from 1810 to 1833 locating states, regions, and rivers along the route. 

Around 1810, when the white people started taking over Missouri and settling 
on the Indians' land, part of the Shawnees in Missouri, together with the 
Delawares and Kickapoos, moved southwest, eventually settling on the Red 
River. In 1824, they made a treaty with the Mexican Government which 



ERLC 



40 



52 



granted them a large tract of land in present northeast Texas, south of the 
Sabine River. Groups of Shawnee Indians settled there in 1825, 1826, and 
later. In 1828, a large group of Shawnee Indians left Ohio and Indiana and 
joined up with the "Chalakatha" Shawnees in Missouri, settling in Kansas. In 
1831, the Shawnees lost their reservations in Ohio (called "Wapakoneta" "Hog 
Creek, H and "Lewistown"), and in 1832 and 1833 most of these Shawnees were 
moved straight west to the Shawnee Reservation in Kansas. Another group 
was moved to the Neosho River in present northeast Oklahoma, and became 
known as the Eastern Shawnees. One band, known as the "Thawekila" group, 
continued to live in southern Missouri until around 1833, and later most of 
them moved to the reservation in Kansas where they became known as the 
Black Bob Band. 

Read this paragraph and then go back and fill in the blanks in the paragraph. As you 
do this utilize your map, provided to help you remember the various dates and places. 

a. In 1839, the land was taken away from the Indians in Texas by force, and 
most of the Shawnees in Texas moved north to the led River and 
subsequently settled on what is now known as South Canadian River, and 
around 1846 they were joined by a group from the Shawnee Reservation in 
Kansas. In 1850, there were three Shawnee villages on the South Canadian 
River, one below and one above the mouth of Little River, and one on Little 
River itself, close to present day Sasakwa. The Shawnees living here in Indian 
Territory became known as the Absentee Shawnee Band. During the Civil 
War, they had to seek refuge from the Confederate forces and moved to 
southern Kansas, most of them living on the Walnut River east of present 
Wichita, Kansas. Most all of the able-bodied men joined the Union Army 
during the war. In 1867, the Absentee Shawnees were told to leave Kansas. 
One group left around August 1867 and settled on Bird Creek north of Tulsa, 
but suffered many deaths due to cholera. The rest went south and settled on 
the North Canadian River in 1867 and 1868. Later the group on Bird Creek 
followed, but some Shawnees remained on Bird Creek and became known as 
the Spybuck Band.

Have the class read the following paragraph and then have them answer the questions 
which follow. 

In 1867, the Shawnees on the reservation in Kansas signed an agreement with the 
Cherokee Nation and went to live In northeast Oklahoma. They became known as the 
Cherokee-Shawnees. The Eastern Shawnees were still living in that area. Part of the 
Shawnees In Kansas, known as the Black Bob Band, wanted to hold their lands In 
common and stuck to their tribal traditions. They suffered great hardship during and 
after the Civil War. By 1869, many were dead. Some of the "Black Bob" Shawnees 
joined the Absentee Shawnees, while others went to live with the Cherokee Shawnees 
and Eastern Shawnees.

b. What happened to the Shawnees still in Kansas, known as the Black Bob 

Band? They by . Some of 

the Black Bob Shawnee joined the , while others went

Read the following information on the Absentee Shawnees: 

The name "Absentee Shawnee" comes from the time when a division of the Shawnee 
Tribe absented itself from the main group when a treaty was about to be signed, and 
left Kansas In 1845 to move to Indian Territory. The Absentee Shawnee Tribe consists 
of two bands: The White Turkey and the Big Jim Band. 

The part of the present Shawnee Agency jurisdiction between the North Canadian River 
and Little River was known as the Absentee Shawnee Reservation, It Is located in 
northern Pottawatomie, Cleveland, and Southeast Oklahoma Counties. In 1875, the first 
attempt was made by the government to allot land to the Indians on an individual basis 
In this area. About half of the tribe was opposed to having Individual allotments, and in 
the spring of 1876 this group moved away and settled on the Klckapoo Reservation on 
Deep Fork River near present Wellston. Here they built themselves log cabins and 
raised livestock. In November 1886, the Indian agent In Shawnee brought about 50 
soldiers from Fort Reno and forced the Shawnees located on Deep Fork River to leave. 
They were brought south to the confluence of Hog Creek and Little River where they 
were told to stay. They lost all their improvements and part of their cattle and had to 
live In Improvised canvas tents during the winter. They became known as the Big Jim 
Band or the Upper Band of Absentee Shawnees. The community was called the Big Jim 
Settlement and was later changed to Little Axe. The rest of the Absentee Shawnees, 
living near present Shawnee In Pottawatomie County, became known as the White 
Turkey Band of Absentee Shawnee. 

The Big Jim Band was opposed to schools, missionary work, and individual allotments, 
and felt they had been unfairly treated by the white people. The White Turkey Band was 
more favorable to schools, having the Shawnee Mission and Mission School situated in 
their area. In 1889, the U.S. Congress passed the Dawes Act, making the allotment of 
Indian land mandatory whether the Tribe wanted it or not, and providing for the opening 
of most of the tribal land to non-Indian settlement. This act had a very strong effect on 
the Indians, in particular upon the conservative Big Jim Band, and the effect was made 
even stronger when the reservation was opened to white people on September 22, 1881 . 
The tribal population fell to the lowest ever. 



54 



The turn of the century was a time of turmoil for the Absentee Shawnee tribe. White 
settlers in the area made several efforts to rid the Indians of everything they had, their 
money and their land. A scheme was made by some of the white men in the new town 
of Shawnee to dispossess the Kickapoo Indians, and their scheme also involved the 
Absentee Shawnee. In the late 1890 % s, these men, known as the "Shawnee Wolves,* 4 
influenced Big Jim and members of the Big Jim Band to move to Mexico where they 
were forced to sign a contact giving up ail their trust land in exchange for a tract of 
land in Mexico. This frauc was brought about by some white men in Shawnee, as well 
as some members of the U.S. Congress, and one member of the Absentee Shawnee 
Business Committee. The fraud was discovered and the contract shown to be illegal, 
but it was too late. In the summer of 1900, Big Jim set out for Mexico with a small 
group of chosen men to firxl a place where their people might take their families and 
build homes. Here they caught smallpox, and the Shawnee men were put in quarantine 
by the Mexicans on the bank \ >f the Salinas River. Most of the men died, including Chief 
Big Jim who died in September 1900. Only a few returned to Oklahoma.

Oklahoma: 

1) Where does the name "Absentee Shawnee" come from? 

2) Where is the Absentee Shawnee Reservation (and located? 

3) Why do you think that half the tribe was opposed to individual 
allotments in 1876?

HISTORY OF THE IOWA TRIBE OF OKLAHOMA 



CONCEPT: 



The lowas though a small tribe made their impact on U.S. history. 
PRESENTATION: 



The following information was taken in part 
from materials provided by the Nebraska Indian 
Commission and from materials submitted by 
Bernadette Huber, a member of the Iowa Tribe of 
Oklahoma. (Materials submitted by Ms. Huber 
were written by Jean Bales, an Iowa tribal member 
and artist) 

The name iowa (pronounced loway) is from 
the tribal term m Ai'-yuwe" which is believed to have 
some connection with the word "marrow." In the 
past this term was believed to mean "sleepy ones," 
but this is not true. The Iowa people called 
themselves "Pahodje" which translates to "snow- 
covered, gray snow, or dusty ones." The Tribe is 
from the Siouan stock and is of close kindred to 
the Missouri and Oto Tribes. 

Little is known about the Tribe's early history. 
However, historians believe the lowas once 
belonged to the Winnebago Tribes. Indigenous to 
the Great Lakes region near the city of Green Bay, 
Wisconsin, the Iowa, Oto, and Missouri Tribes 
separated from the Winnebagoes and migrated 
south to the Iowa River. The Oto and Missouri 
traveled further westward to the Missouri River 
region while the Iowa located near Okoboji Lake. 

Over the early years of migration, before 
location in Oklahoma and Kansas, the Iowa were 
located at the mouth of the Red Rock River in 
Illinois, the Des Moines River region, present Iowa, 
and the Red Pipestone Quarry in Minnesota. 
French explorer Le Sueur mentioned the lowas as 
being in the Blue Earth River region in Minnesota in 
1701. 

Another group of the Iowa remained in 
southern Minnesota following their separation from 
the Winnebago. Pressured by their aggressive 
neighbors, the Dakota, this group relocated at the 
mouth of the White River in South Dakota near 
Omaha and Ponca camps. The Omaha and Iowa 
migrated south to Bow Creek, Nebraska. This 
occurred around 1650. The Iowa eventually 
crossed back into Iowa across the Missouri River. 
The Iowa did not permanently settle in Nebraska 



until the 1800's, often camping around the Platte 
and Grand Nemaha Rivers. From their river 
location, the Iowa engaged in fur trapping and 
exchanged pelts with traders traveling the Missouri 
River.

As a member of the Siouan linguistic family 
(which includes the Winnebago, Oto, Ponca, 
Missouri, and Omaha), the Iowa, with the Oto and 
Missouri, comprised the Chiwere sub-group of the 
Siouan family. Chiwere literally translated means, 
"the home people," which aptly describes their 
semi-agrarian culture.

Neighboring tribes called the lowas "Dusty 
Heads." The Winnebago chief, Baptiste, once 
explained that the lowas often bathed in the 
Missouri's yellow-muddy waters. The river's 
sediment remained on their heads after they had 
dried, giving them a dusty or gray appearance, 
hence the name. 

The Iowa culture integrated eastern woodland 
life-styles and the nomadic characteristics of the 
western plains culture. Their farming activity was 
not extensive but included crops cultivated by most 
woodland tribes - corn, beans, and squash. The 
lowas' ornate dress, pottery, and clan groupings 
within the tribe were distinctly characteristic of 
eastern tribal cultures. The tribe's frequent 
migrations between the two great rivers reflect their 
kinship to their nomadic neighbors to the west. 
Scholars attribute their migrations to the presence 
and availability of deer, elk, and buffalo which 
strongly suggests that the buffalo increasingly 
became more important as the State of Iowa 
became more populated, disrupting Iowa 
settlements. 

Though characteristically nonaggressive and 
described as an "insignificant and inconspicuous 
tribe," the Iowa were involved in as many treaty 
negotiations as any other plains tribe. The Iowa's 
first land cession occurred in 1824 and concluded 
in 1861. The tribe ceded land largely located in the 

APPLICATION: 



State of Iowa and some land along the northern 
Missouri border. At the 1830 treaty negotiations 
held at Prairie du Chien, the iowas with the Sac and 
Fox, Santee and Sisseton Sioux, and the Omahas 
each agreed to pay the Otoes one hundred dollars 
annually for ten years for a tract of land between 
the Grand and Little Nemaha Rivers for their 
half-breed relatives. 

In 1836, the tribe was given land along the 
southern boundary of the Missouri River extending 
along the Grand Nemaha. The lowas were iocated 
on the lower section of land granted while the Sac 
and Fox were given adjoining land to the north. 
However, the treaty of 1854 significantly reduced 
the lowas' reserve. 

An 1885 congressional act provided for the 
sale of Iowa land in Kansas and Nebraska and 
arranged their removal to Indian Territory. Unlike 
the fate of other tribes relocated J ;v Oklahoma, 
individual lowas were allowed t.:< amain in 
Nebraska and Kansas and were :.' *<*n 80 to 160 
acres in severalty that was held - trust for 25 
years and then awarded in fee. 

Today, a small group of lowas live in the 
vicinity of Perkins, Oklahoma. The Kansas group of 
lowas still live on lands that straddle the states of 
Kansas and Nebraska. Their number is much 
larger than that of the lowas in Oklahoma. 



ACTIVITIES : 

1. Do additional research on the lowas of Oklahoma. Use books and/or contact the 
Iowa Tribal Office (see resources) to ask for additional information on the tribe. 

2. Take a field trip to the iowa Tribal Complex. Ask in advance to have someone set up 
a time where two or three elders and the Tribal Chairperson can be interviewed. 
Develop a format for your class interview before your trip. 

3. Write to the Nebraska Indian Commission in Lincoln, Nebraska and ask for additional 
information on the lowas.

THE KICKAPOOS 



CONCEPT: 

The history of the Kickapoo Tribe started long before they arrived in Oklahoma. 
PRESENTATION: 



The Kickapoo were people neither of the plain 
nor the forest, but occupied a transitional zone 
between the prairie on the west and the deciduous 
forest on the east. The highlands of this transitional 
zone nourished a lush grassland while the valleys 
and stream banks supported heavy growths of 
trees. Throughout the wanderings of the tribesmen 
from Wisconsin toward the southwest, they 
remained in the environment that provided a blend 
of both types of vegetation. There was a significant 
difference in temperatures between Wisconsin and 
Mexico as well as variations in rainfall, but the 
Kickapoo liked a balance between prairies and 
forest. 

The first recorded homeland, reported in the 
1650s by French explorers, was in southern 
Wisconsin along the Fox and Wisconsin Rivers. 
Also noted were two bands: the Prairie Band, to the 
west, and the Vermillion Band, along the Illinois 
River. Here, the KicKapoo spent their summers in 
fixed villages, tending their crops. During the 
winter, however, they roamed south into Illinois 
looking for game. 

Linguistically the Kickapoo were Algonquian 
and spoke a language similar to the Sac and to the 
Shawnee. The Kickapoo have been classified as a 
woodland tribe, a group which included the 
Chippewas, Winnebago, and Potawatomi, yet they 
did not rely on the wild rice or utilize the canoe. 
The Kickapoo probably were recent migrants into 
the south Wisconsin area and had not geared their 
economy to rice but lived instead by hunting, 
horticulture, and gathering. 

Much of their migration and relocation was 
not of their own choice, but constituted a response 
to the pressures of other Indian tribes, European 
traders, and American settlers. The name Kickapoo 

APPLICATION: 



is from Kiwigapawa, M he stands about, H or "he 
moves about, standing now here, now there." 

Following the French and Indian War, the 
Kickapoo moved into southern Illinois and later 
eastward to the Wabash River. They were included 
in the great Indian confederacy of Tecumseh, in 
1811-13. A treaty in 1819 provided for the cession 
of ail Kickapoo lands in liiinois (nearly half that 
state) and the assignment of a tribal reservation in 
Missouri. This land in turn was relinquished by a 
treaty in 1832 and a second reservation was 
assigned along the Missouri River in what is now 
northeastern Kansas. A large band of Kickapoo 
who objected to the cessioned Illinois lands in 
1819, went to Texas where they became allies of 
the Texas Cherokee. They were defeated in battle 
by the Texans in 1839 and forced to retreat to 
Indian Territory north of the Red River where they 
established a village on Wild Horse Creek in 
present Garvin County. They lived here until they 
went to Mexico in 1850-51 with Wild Cat, the 
Seminole. They were known as the Mexican 
Kickapoo from that time on. Another band of 
Kickapoo from Texas settled by permission of the 
Creek People on the Canadian River, about fifteen 
miles above the mouth of Little River. At the 
outbreak of the Civil War, the Canadian River 
Kickapoo went to Mexico. In 1893 a specially 
appointed United States commission finally induced 
them to return to the Indian Territory. 

Today [in 1983] approximately half the 1,691 
members of the Oklahoma Kickapoo Tribe live in 
Mexico; while the Kansas Kickapoo Tribe lives in 
Horton, Kansas. The Kickapoos retain many of 
their traditional ways. Today the Mexican 
Kickapoos hold dual citizenship in the United States 
and Mexico. 



ACTIVITIES :

names by others. Explain your answer in a short sentence. 

6. Use an atlas and draw a large map of the United States including the outlines of 
Oklahoma, Illinois, Wisconsin and Texas and trace the movement of the Kickapoos, 
starting in Wisconsin, to Illinois to the Wabash River, Missouri River, Red River, Wild 
Horse Creek, Canadian and Little Rivers. 

7. Write a creative short story (fiction) about the Kickapoo's defeat In Texas and their 
journey to Mexico. Entitle your story The Mexican Kickapoos."

THE ARAPAHO WAY OF LIFE 



CONCEPT: 



The Arapaho were a tribe of the plains. 



PRESENTATION: 



Although their way of life was basically like 
that of other Plains Indians who were nomadic and 
subsisted on the buffalo, the Arapaho were 
especially noted for their hlghiy organized 
ceremonial life and their symbolic decorative arts. 
The name, Arapaho, was probably the first applied 
to the tribe by American trappers early in the 18th 
century. The name came from the Crow Indian 
word for the tribe, Ara-pa-hoe, meaning "lots of 
tattoos." Early French and British traders on the 
Missouri River knew the Arapaho by the Ojibwa 
term, Kananavish, or the French-Canadian term, 
Gens de Vache, both of which mean "Buffalo 
People." The Arapaho call themselves Hinana?- 
aeina? {Hee-nah-nah?ah-ay-nah?) t which is best 
translated simply as "Arapaho." 



The Arapaho language Is an Algonqulan 
language most closely related to Atsina (Gros 
Ventre). Arapaho is more distantly related to 
Cheyenne and Blackfoot (languages spoken by 
Plains tribes) and to Ojibwa, Menominee, Shawnee, 
and other eastern Algonqulan languages. Since the 
Arapaho were closely associated with the 
Cheyenne during most of the 19th century, it is 
commonly believed that the two tribes share very 
similar cultures and recent histories. In fact, 
however, the Arapaho differ culturally from the 
Cheyenne in several important aspects, and there 
is no reason other than force of habit to believe 
they shared a common history much before 1800. 

When first contacted, the Arapatto lived along 
the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains in the 




vicinity of present day Colorado and Wyoming. 
There were five major divisions, including the 
Atsina, each with its own dialect. Three of these 
divisions have become completely submerged in 
the Arapaho, and their dialects have been extinct 
since about 1900. Today the Arapaho tribe is in 
two divisions, one in Wyoming and the other in 
Oklahoma, while the Atsina are a distinct tribe with 
a reservation in Montana. 

The Arapaho were thus a mountain, as well as 
a Plains, people. They frequented the sheltered 
valleys of the foothills in winter, the well-watered 
mountain parks in late summer, and came down 
onto the Plains for the great tribal buffalo hunts of 
early summer and late fall. At some remote date 
they may have lived in settled villages and raised 
corn as did the Cheyenne. However, they have 
always been known to Whites as horse-using 
nomads and buffalo hunters, using the tipi for 
shelter, the travois for transport, and making much 
use of animal hides for clothing and containers. 

The Arapaho excelled in the decoration of 
leather items. They used porcupine quills or bead 
embroidery in combination with fringe and 
pendants of hair, elk teeth, or hoof tips. Designs 
were geometrical and the different elements had 
symbolic meanings to the makers. The quilling of 
robes and tipi ornaments was supervised by certain 
old women who owned medicine bags, and was 
done with considerable ceremony. Rawhide 
containers, shields, and sometimes tipis were 
decorated with painted designs in bright colors. 

Arapaho men hunted the buffalo both 
cooperatively and individually, killing the animals 
with lances or bows and arrows. During the great 
tribal hunts and when game was scarce there were 
hunting rules strictly enforced by one of the men's 
age-societies. When game was plentiful individuals 
could hunt as they pleased. Surplus meat was 
dried and stored for winter use, some being 
pounded with choke cherries and fat to make 
pemmican. Deer, elk, and bighorn were also 
hunted, as well as some small animals and birds. 
Prairie turnip, choke cherry and some other wild 
plant foods supplemented the meat diet. 

The most important social unit for an individual 
was his or her extended family which consisted of 
a number of related nuclear families who pitched 
their tipis close together. The women shared tasks 
such as slicing meat and tapping hides, and all 
members had a part in socializing the children. 

For most of the year the tribe was dispersed 
over its territory in hunting bands. The bands were 
extremely flexible units, large enough to afford 



safety against enemy attack, and small enough to 
exploit the resources of game efficiently. The 
extended families in a band were allied by kinship, 
marriage, or some common interest. At the core of 
the band was usually a single large and wealthy 
extended family whose members worked well 
together and were able to unite for group action 
when necessary. The head of this family was likely 
to be the leader of the band. 

Women usually married in their late teens, and 
men in their middle twenties. Men could have more 
than one wife if they could afford it, usually 
marrying two or more sisters. Women earned 
respect through industry, skill at quilling or beading, 
and participation in the ceremonies of the Buffalo 
Lodge, the women's society. Women could also be 
doctors and acquire supernatural powers. 

Men were greatly shaped by the warrior 
society system. The Arapaho were the only tribe 
on the southern Plains with a system of age-graded 
societies. That is, all men of a particular age group 
belonged to the society appropriate for their age. 
Young men of about fifteen joined the lowest- 
ranked society, the Fox, and moved on to the Star, 
Tomahawk, and other societies as they advanced 
in age. There were eight societies, each with its 
own dance and/or ceremony, and they were 
ranked from low to high on the basis of age and 
ceremonial importance. Members of the two 
highest societies (old men) were the ceremonial 
leaders of the tribe. In the society system, men In 
older societies had authority over men below them, 
and thus the authority of Arapaho chiefs and 
leaders came in part from their being members of 
older societies. In early times, there may have 
been no head chiefs as such, but when treaty- 
making with the government began, men with both 
ceremonial authority and great personal influence 
were recognized by all as tribal chiefs. 

The major tribal ceremony was the Sun Dance 
which lasted four days and was held early in the 
summer. The whole tribe came together and 
camped in a great circle, and there was much 
visiting, dancing, feasting, courtship, and gaiety 
throughout the whole time of preparation and 
activity. The Arapaho had the most elaborate form 
of the Sun Dance on the Plains. They called It the 
"Offerings Lodge," for in their view the dancers 
made offerings of their bodies by enduring hunger, 
thirst and fatigue in return for supernatural 
blessings for the whole tribe. The Arapaho believed 
In a mysterious, ail pervasive power called "Man- 
Above," to whom they prayed. Their most sacred 
object and symbol of tribal existence was the Flat

ERLC

Pipe, kept in a bundle with other sacred objects. A 
Sacred Wheel was also Important, expeclally for the 
southern Arapaho, and was used In the Sun Dance. 

Illness and Injuries were treated by doctors, 
often in sweathouses, with singing, praying, shaking 
of rattles, and administering herbal medicines. 
When a death occurred, the surviving relatives cut 
their hair and put on old clothes. Women, 
especially, walled loudly, and sometimes lightly 
gashed their arms or legs with a knife. Burial was 
in a grave dug In sandhills, and usually a horse was 
killed over it. Mourning lasted a year and ended 
with a face-painting ceremony and feast. 

The Arapaho were usually friendly with the 
Cheyenne, Kiowa, Kiowa-Apache, and Comanche, 
and almost always at war with the Ute, Shoshone, 
and Pawnee. They killed a few American trappers 
in their territory, but usually met white traders in 
peace, and also official representatives of the 
United States. They saw nothing wrong in raiding 
the wagon trains on the Santa Fe trail or the 
Spanish settlements In the Southwest. They did 
participate In hostilities against white settlers when 
they saw their lands and way of life threatened. 

Treaties were made with the government in 
1851, 1862, 1875, and 1867. The latter was the 
Medicine Lodge Treaty where, with the Southern 
Cheyenne, the southern bands of the Arapaho 
accepted a reservation In northwestern Indian 
Territory. The northern bands were eventually 
settled in Wyoming by terms of other treaties. As 
a tribe the southern Arapaho remained peaceful 
after the Medicine Lodge Treaty, though some 
individuals fought with the Cheyenne, Kiowa, and 
Comanche against white encroachment for several 
more years. 

By 1880 the buffalo were gone and the 
Arapaho were dependent upon government rations 
whiie they learned other ways of making a living. 
Some men began to farm a little and raise livestock 
and others sought Agency jobs or joined the Indian 
scouts. In 1891 the Southern Arapaho and 
Cheyenne were forced to take 160 acre allotments, 
and a year later the rest of their reservation was 
opened to white settlement. There emerged a 
checkerboard settlement pattern with Indian lands 
being interspersed with tracts owned by Whites. 
Over the years the amount of land in Indian 
ownership has steadily declined as Indian tracts 
were sold to non-Indians, and many of the 
remaining Indian tracts are now owned by many 
heirs of an original allottee. 

Many southern Arapaho became fairly 
successful at subsistence farming and a few were 



ERIC 



able to market their crops successfully. Frame 
houses were built and children were made to go to 
school and wear white men's clothes. By World 
War I, the outward style of life was much like that of 
their rural white neighbors. For many reasons 
Indian farmers were never able to compete in the 
market with white farmers, and gradually they came 
to depend for their livelihood on income derived 
from leasing their lands. Today few, if any, 
Arapaho farm on a market scale, and most depend 
on income from wage labor and land leases for 
their living. 

At present the southern Arapaho are organized 
with the southern Cheyenne as the Cheyenne- 
Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma. The Arapaho 
language Is still spoken, but not as much in 
Oklahoma as in Wyoming. Oklahoma Arapaho still 
revere the Rat Pipe which is cared for in Wyoming, 
and many participate in the Sun Dance there every 
summer. The Arapaho were the first Plains tribe to 
adopt the Ghost Dance of 1890, with its doctrine of 
a new world for Indians, and they helped introduce 
it to neighboring tribes. Later the peyote religion 
became an important form of worship and is still 
the main form of religious expression for many 
Arapaho. Many Arapaho have also joined Christian 
churches, the Mennonite and Baptist denominations 
being most important to Oklahoma. 

The age-society system ceased to function 
soon after allotment, but in recent years a number 
of pow-wow clubs and veterans' organizations have 
formed, through which Indian community activities 
take place. The Arapaho Starhawk Society, 
organized in 1970, takes its name from one of the 
old societies. Though it was formed for modern 
gourd dancing, it is considered to be a survival of 
traditional Arapaho culture. The Barefoot Park 
Pow-Wow, held near Canton each summer, is 
sponsored by the Arapaho community and is the 
place where new chiefs are formally presented to 
the public. 

Today [In 1983], there are 14 tribal chiefs 
(seven Cheyennes and seven Arapahoes), but their 
positions are honorary and advisory rather than 
political. The Tribal Business Committee, consisting 
of four Arapahoes and four Cheyennes elected for 
four-year terms, handles the business affairs of the 
Tribe. Although there has been considerable 
inter-marriage with other tribes, especially with 
Cheyennes, a strong sense of Arapaho identity 
persists. Many Cheyenne and Arapaho people live 
around the towns of Geary, Canton, Colony, and 
Greenfield, but many live in other towns of western 
Oklahoma and in urban areas. The Arapaho are

THE PEOPLE 1 : YESTERDAY AND TODAY 



CONCEPT: 

The Cheyenne people have lived in many places during their long history. 



PRESENTATION: 

The Cheyenne Indians, or Tsistsistas, meaning 
The People," are one of the most notable of the 
western tribes which inhabited the Great Plains. 
The tribe belongs to the Algonquian linguistic 
family. The name Cheyenne was given to them by 
the Sioux. Several hundred years ago, the 
Cheyennes resided in the woodland country of the 
western Great Lakes (probably in the vicinity of 
Lake Superior). Toward the end of the seventeeth 
century they migrated westward, settling on the 
Red River where it forms the bc r der between 
Minnesota and the Dakotas. 



and grew corn, beans, and squash in the manner of 
their new neighbors. Their way of life was both 
sedate and sedentary. 

Then came the introduction of the horse (circa 
1760), and new vistas opened for the Cheyenne. 
The plains were teeming with bison, an extremely 
rich source of food and derivative by-products. 

From 1857 to 1879, the Cheyennes were 
embroiled in almost continuous fighting with the 
Americans. The wars were not of their own 
choosing, but were forced upon them by whites 
who were little disposed to discriminate among 




Early in the eighteenth century they became 
closely associated with the sedentary village tribes 
of the upper Missouri River-namely, the Mandan, 
HkJatsa, and Arikara. These tribes were old-time 
gardeners who relied upon hunting for subsidiary 
subsistence. They lived in permanent villages 
constructed of large, semisubterranean earth 
lodges (Wilson, 1934). They were organized into 
matrilineal clans. During the eighteenth century, 
and for the first decade or two of the nineteenth, 
the Cheyennes settled down in earth lodge villages 



Indians. The Cheyennes were made to suffer for 
the more aggressive hostility of the Sioux, Kiowas, 
and Comanches, until they, too, were involved in 
warfare for survh/al-from which there was no 
escape but humiliating surrender and reservation 
for life. The Sand Creek Massacre (1864) was an 
unprovoked attack on a friendly Cheyenne camp In 
which women and children were slaughtered along 
with the men who tried to defend them. In 1861, 
the Cheyenne and Southern Arapaho signed a 
treaty with the U.S. at Fort Wise, Kansas, ceding 



ERLC 



54 66 



lands In Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, and 
Wyoming. !n 1867, they signed ^he Medicine 
Lodge Treaty which provided for their location in 
Indian Territory. 

The Cheyennes played a large part in the 
repulse of Custer's attack on the Cheyenne-Sioux 
encampment on the Little Big Horn (1876), during 
which Custer and his command were annihilated. 
In spite of their successes at the Custer fight, and 
the defeats inflicted on Crook and others of his 
predecessors, the Cheyennes succumbed after the 
final destruction of the camps of Dull Knife and Two 
Moons, In 1 877 and 1 878. The Northern 
Cheyennes were forced south and confined with 
the Southern Cheyennes in what is now Oklahoma. 
In an attempt to return north to Montana, their 
beloved homeland, their hones were vanquished at 
great human loss. Separate reservations were 
established shortly afterwards on Tongue River, In 
Montana, and in southwestern Oklahoma. Today, 
the Northern Cheyenne live in Montana, while the 
Southern Cheyenne live in Oklahoma. 

In the north, the Cheyennes now subsist 
mostly as cattle raisers. In Oklahoma, they do 
small farming and lease their lands to oil and gas 
producers. In the mld-1930's, each unit elected to 
take on modern forms of a tribal business organiza- 
tion under the Indian Reorganization Act. The Sun 
Dance is still an annual affair for them. The Peyote 
Cult has become the major form of religious 
expression for most Cheyennes-although 
Christianity is practiced by some. 

The Cheyenne are organized today [1 983] with 
the Arapaho as the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes 
of Oklahoma located In Concho, Oklahoma, just 
north of El Reno on Highway 81. Tribal affairs are 
administered by a Tribal Business Committee 

APPLICATION: 



consisting of four Arapahoes and four Cheyennes, 
elected for four year terms. There is an 
organization of chiefs modeled on the old Council 
of Chiefs. For some time the chiefs have been 
honorary and ceremonial, rather than political. In 
recent years, however, the chiefs' organization has 
taken an active role in promoting language and 
cultural heritage programs. 

Within the former reservation area, the 
Cheyenne live mostly in the towns of Watonga, 
Canton, Thomas, Selling, Clinton, and Weatherford, 
but many have sought employment in urban areas. 
Summer pow-wows offer occasions for family 
reunions, social dances, and activities which 
promote tribal identity. One of the largest 
pow-wows Is the tribally-sponsored Cheyenne and 
Arapaho Pow-Wow which is held at Colony each 
summer. There are many gourd dance organiza- 
tions among the Cheyenne people. Some of these 
gourd dance organizations are considered to be 
derived from old military societies-although the 
costumes are modern and the activities have been 
adaped to serve present needs and interests. An 
important part of any pow-wow is attention to the 
American flag and the honoring of war veterans. 

The Sun Dance is still performed almost every 
year near Seiling, and the Sacred Arrows are 
carefully guarded in a special tip! and sometimes 
renewed in the old manner. They are greatly 
revered by all Cheyenne people. The Cheyenne 
language is stiii spoken in many homes. The 
modern Cheyenne, while increasingly aware of the 
advantages of formal education and economic 
development, make every effort to preserve as 
much as possible of their heritage, of which they 
are justly proud.

APACHE TRIBE OF OKLAHOMA 



CONCEPT: 



The Apache Tribe of Oklahoma became a distinct tribe of their own in 1971 . Before then they 
were known as the Kiowa-Apache Tribe. 



PRESENTATION: 

The relatively small Apache Tribe of Oklahoma 
may have lived on the Plains longer than any of the 
other nomadic tribes found there In historic times, 
with the possible exception of the Kiowa. In the 
early 19th century they were known as the plains 
Apache, or as the Kataka. Since they usually 
camped near the Kiowa Tribe and were associated 
with the latter in dealings with the government, they 
came to be known as the Kiowa Apache. They call 
themselves Na-l-sha-dena, of which dena probably 
means "people." It Is not known when the Apaches 
made alliances with the Kiowas, but it was probably 
during the time both tribes lived in the Northern 
Plains. However, It is important to note here that 
both tribes always retained their own customs, 
traditions and languages. Today they do not like 
the term Kiowa Apache, which suggests to many 
people that they are a part of the Kiowa tribe, but 
since 1971 they have had their own constitution 
and call themselves The Apache Tribe of 
Oklahoma." 



The Kiowa Apache people speak an 
Athabascan language closely related to Lipan and 
JlcarHIa Apache, and to Mescalero, Chirlcahua, and 
White Mountain Apache and Navajo. The language 
Is somewhat more distantly related to Sarsi and 
other Athabascan lannuages of northwestern 
Canada. It is believed that all of the Apache groups 
separated from the Canadian Athabascans and 
moved south to the Plains and Southwest well back 
In prehistoric times. 

The Plains Apache encountered by Coronado 
and other early explorers were nomadic hunters, 
depending mainly on the buffalo. They lived in 
portable skin tipis and used dogs and travois for 
transportation. They traded regularly with settled 
village tribes both to the east and west of the 
Plains. They exchanged hides, tallow, meat, salt 
and other Items for corn and other produce. 

The Kiowa Apaches and the Kiowas were 
among the first Plains tribes to acquire the horse. 
Both tribes helped in Introducing horses to other 




tribes such as the Arapaho and the Cheyenne. In 
the early 1800's the Apache and other southern 
tribes traveled regularly to the Black Hills and to the 
Missouri River to trade horses to the northern 
tribes. In return they obtained guns and other 
manufactured items. The Kiowa Apache, like the 
Kiowa and Comanche, used to replenish their 
supply of horses by raiding the Spanish 
settlements. 

The time of living or trading in the vicinity of 
the Black Hills was important for both the Kiowa 
Apache and the Kiowa. Both tribes have sacred 
traditions about this area, and some of their tribal 
nr jicines are said to have been given them there. 
Possibly also during this time of peaceful 
intaraction with the northern Plains tribes, they 
adopted warrior societies and the Sun Dance. 

Although the Kiowa Apache formerly ranged 
widely over the high plains, they eventually came to 
regard the country south of the Arkansas River as 
their home. After Benfs Fort on the Arkansas was 
established in 1833, they no longer had to travel far 
to the north for trade goods. Sometimes they were 
visited by itinerant traders, especially Mexicans 
from the southwest. They were usually on peaceful 
relations with neighboring plains tribes - the Kiowa, 
Wichita, Arapaho, Cheyenne, and Comanche and 
hostile to such tribes as the Ute, Navajo, Pawnee, 
and Osage. 

During the 19th century the Kiowa Apache 
associated frequently with the Kiowa for mutual 
advantage in trade and warfare. This was a time of 
unsettled conditions with eastern trioes being 
pushed onto the Plains and ever increasing 
numbers of whites coming to trap, trade, and settle. 
Though small in numbers, the Kiowa Apache were 
always an independent tribe. On occasion they left 
the Kiowa completely and camped close to the 
Arapaho or Cheyenne, or, in times of relative peace 
and quiet, completely apart from other tribes. 

The Kiowa Apache way of life during the 19th 
century was basically like that of other nomadic 
Plains tribes. The buffalo furnished hides for tipis 
and clothing as well as food. Deer, antelope, elk 
and smaller animals were also used. Corn was 
often obtained by trade with horticultural tribes. 

The hunting was done by men, usually on 
orseback. Tribal hunts were held in the summer 
after the Kiowa Sun Dance, and In the late fall. 
These big hunts were strictly policed by the 
Manatidie, one of the men's societies. Individuals 
who broke the hunting rules were punished by 
being whipped or having some horses killed or 
other property destroyed. Most men were also 



warriors and were expected to fight In defense of 
the camp, and to demonstrate bravery by going on 
war expeditions. Most war parties set out after 
horses and other plunder, but some were organized 
to kill enemies, usually in retaliation for a previous 
injury. Boys were taught from childhood how to 
use weapons and endure hardship. The most 
respected men in the tribe were brave warriors and 
owners of large horse herds. 

Daily activities in camp were carried on within 
the extended family. Such a group consisted of 
several related elementary families, each with its 
own tipi, which camped close to each other. 
Women in the family usually cooperated in such 
tasks as slicing meat, dressing hides, and gathering 
wild plant foods. Young men and older boys 
tended the horses and hunted together. Children 
were much wanted and loved; they were well 
treated and cared for by everyone in the camp. 
Old people were also cherished as valuable 
members of the family. Old women cared for small 
children and did much of the sewing and food 
preparation. Old people helped train their 
grandchildren for adult life and taught them proper 
behavior. At night they told stories which not only 
entertained everyone, but educated the young in 
the traditions of the tribe. 

Since the Kiowa Apache of the I9th century 
numbered only around 300 or 400 persons, they 
were a very close-knit group. Everyone was related 
in some way to every member of the tribe; 
however, distant relationships were often lightly 
regarded or ignored. Marriage was with persons 
outside the immediate circle of relatives, but there 
was strong pressure to marry within the tribe. 

For much of the year the tribe might be found 
in several camps, usually fairly close to each other. 
Each camp had a headman who was mature and 
knowledgeable, and who might own one of the 
sacred medicine bundles. Although he had no 
authority to command, his advice was taken 
seriously. There was no single head chief. 

There were four societies which served 
military, social and ceremonial ends. Most adult 
men belonged to the Manatidie, a Blackfeet 
Society, which held an annual dance every spring, 
and other dances before a war party set out. The 
Manatidle also had police duties during tribal 
encampments and marches, and during the tribal 
buffalo hunts. The Klintidie, or Horse Society, was 
smaller and composed of men with outstanding war 
records. In battle they were obligated to 
demonstrate extreme bravery - even recklessness. 
There was a society for women, the lzuwe t which 



59 71 



held secret ceremonies for the benefit of the whole 
tribe. There was also a children's Society called 
the Kasowe or Rabbit Society. All boys and girls 
participated in the Rabbit Society Dance and 
through this activity came to know each other and 
feel a part of the tribe. They learned the ways of 
society membership. 

Religion centered upon four tribal medicine 
bundles which, accc.uing to tradition, were given 
the tribe long ago by supernatural beings. These 
bundles had power to safeguard the whole tribe, 
and bestow blessings to individuals who prayed to 
them. Owners of these bundles had the right to 
settle disputes between individuals and families. 
The Kiowa Apache joined the Kiowa in putting on a 
Sun Dance early in the summer, but their own 
medicine bundles were of much greater importance 
in their religious life. 

The Kiowa Apache made treaties with the 
United States in 1837, 1853, 1865, and 1867. The 
latter was the Treaty of Medicine Lodge in which 
they, along with the Kiowa and Comanche, were 
given a reservation of almost three million acres in 
southwestern Indian Territory, located near Fort 
Cobb and Apache, Oklahoma. Although there were 
a number of hostilities after this treaty, the Kiowa 
Apache as a tribe remained peaceful. Most of them 
stayed close to the Agency at Fort Siil, though a 
few individuals joined hostile factions of the 
Kiowa-Comanche and Cheyenne in the last wars on 
the southern Plains. 

Peace came to the Plains in 1875 and within a 
few years the buffalo were gone. The Kiowa 
Apache realized the necessity for making a new life. 
Many men took jobs at the Agency or enlisted in 
the Indian Scouts. Some began to raise gardens 
and livestock. As schools, churches and trading 
posts were established the Kiowa Apache began to 
adopt many of the external trappings of American 
frontier life, including white man's clothes. 
Nevertheless, they were often discouraged with trie 
new life and longed for the old days when they 
could wander and hunt buffalo. In 1890, the Ghost 
Dance religion was introduced to the Apache by 
the southern Arapaho. It was believed that a new 
world, only for Indians, was coming and that the 
buffalo would return. Many Kiowa Apache 
accepted the Ghost Dance with enthusiasm, but as 
the basic promises remained unfulfilled they turned 



to other forms of religion. Many joined Christian 
churches, the Baptist and Methodist denominations 
being dominant in their area. Others turned to the 
peyote religion as the most satisfying form of 
worship. This religion was a blend of native Indian 
and Christian elements and involved the ceremonial 
eating of a spineless cactus found in South Texas, 
peyote. The Kiowa Apache learned of the peyote 
religion early from the Lipan and Mescalero 
Apache, and helped spread it to the Kiowa, 
Arapaho, Cheyenne and other Oklahoma tribes. 
Today this form of worship is organized as the 
Native American Church and is important for most 
Kiowa Apache people. 

The Kiowa-Comanche-Apache Reservation 
was abolished in 1901 and each member of these 
tribes received a 160-acre allotment. Few 
Individuals were ever able to make a living from 
farming, as had been hoped, and most families 
lived on income derived from leasing their unused 
lands, or by selling the lands of deceased relatives. 
Today most remaining Indian tracts are owned by 
a number of heirs of the original allottees. 

For many years the Kiowa Apaches, Kiowa 
and Comanche tribes had a joint Business 
Committee which handled tribal assets and 
business affairs, but in the late sixties this was 
dissolved and each of the three tribes framed its 
own constitution and separate tribal government. 
In 1971, the Kiowa Apache became organized as 
the Apache Tribe of Oklahoma. They now number 
approximately 1000 enrolled members [in 1983], 
many living in and around the towns of Anadarko, 
Fort Cobb and Apache, with others living in 
Oklahoma City, Dallas, and other urban areas. 
Their tribal language has all but disappeared; only 
a few middle-aged and older persons are able to 
speak it with any fluency. The four tribal medicine 
bundles are still revered, and at least one Is cared 
for in the traditional way. In recent years the 
Apache Tribe of Oklahoma have become noted for 
their Blackfeet Dance, a revival of the old Manatidie 
Society. This dance was revived in 1958 and since 
then has been the symbol of their tribal identity and 
the most important means by which surviving 
elements of traditional culture are expressed. Since 
1 964 there have been two Blackfeet Societies which 
sometimes compete and sometimes cooperate in 
putting on annual dances.

A SHORT CADDO HISTORY 



CONCEPT: 



The Caddo's trek from the southeastern part of the U.S. where they originally lived was a long, 
difficult period of time. 



PRESENTATION: 



The Caddo Indian Tribe belongs to the 
Caddoan linguistic family. The name Caddo is a 
derivative of Kadohadacho, which signifies "real 
chiefs* who formed a confederacy with six 
subdivisions. The Caddoans formed a confederacy 
in southern Oklahoma and northern Texas called 
the Hasinai Confederacy. 

The Caddo trace their ancestral home to 
Southeastern United States. The earliest mention 
of the Anadarko Tribe of the Caddo Confederacy is 
in the relation of Biedma (1544) who wrote that 
Moscoso in 1545 led his men during their 
southward march through the territory which lay 
east of this group of Indians. Their villages were 
scattered along the Trinity and Brazos Rivers in 
Texas. References to the Caddo appear in the 
records of the DeSoto expedition of 1541. Other 
earlier explorers found Caddo villages in present 
day west central Arkansas. 

The Caddo were primarily agriculturists and 
traders until the horse as a means of transportation 
was demonstrated by early pioneers. After learning 
to ride horses, the Caddo adopted the transient 
culture of the Plains tribes, making hunting 
expeditions to the west. 



Four items the Caddos took with them each 
time they moved were a drum, corn, cedar, and 
fire. The fire (or ashes) from the last camp was 
used to start the fire of the next place of 
encampment. 

In 1835, the Caddo signed a treaty ceding their 
ancestral lands and agreeing to move beyond the 
United States western boundary. They settled with 
the Anadarko tribes west of the Brazos River in 
Texas. But the white settlers' hostility toward the 
Caddo forced the tribe to move to Indian Territory 
in 1859. Over 1,400 Caddo - many on foot - 
found a new home along the Washita River within 
present Caddo County, Oklahoma. An agreement 
with the Wichita Tribe in 1872 authorized the 
establishment of a joint Wichita Reservation. Each 
Caddo man, woman, and child received 160 acres. 

Today [in 1983], the Caddo are closely 
affiliated with the Wichita and Delaware tribes in 
their social activities and joint land holdings. The 
three tribes have 2,343 acres owned jointly and 
61,264 allotted acres. Full and mixed blood Caddo 
number over 2,100 in the Anadarko, Fort Cobb, 
Hinton, and Gracemont areas of Oklahoma.

COMANCHE HISTORY 



CONCEPT: 



The Comanche, a powerful tribe, was the "Lord of the Plains." 



PRESENTATION: 



The origin of the Comanches was probably on 
the eastern fringes of the Basin area somewhere in 
the vicinity of southwestern Montana and 
northwestern Wyoming. It has been suggested 
from available sources that the area of Wyoming 
between the Yellowstone and the Platte Rivers may 
come close to defining the general vicinity of 
Comanche origin. The Comanches originally were 
a part of the southern tribes of the Shoshonean 
Indians and the only part of the group living entirely 
on the plains. 

The Comanches are of the same linguistic 
family as the Shoshone of the Rocky Mountains 
and the Great Basin area. The name Comanche 
was acquired sometime after 1700. 

In the late 1600's the Comanches began to 
migrate to the south coming into contact with the 
Spanish settlements of New Spain and to the east 
onto the plains. The Comanches most likely moved 
south to be nearer a source of horses, which they 
first acquired while raiding with the Utes in Northern 
New Mexico. By the 1700's they were well 
established on the Middle Plains. 

In the early eighteenth century the Comanches 
began to expand to a greater degree onto the 
plains. By the middle of the eighteenth century the 
Comanches had established themselves as a real 
threat to the Spanish settlements in New Mexico. 
In the late eighteenth century the dangerous 
situation provoked by the Comanches 1 acquisition 



of guns stimulated the Spanish to send military 
forces against the Comanches, whose center at 
that time was in southeastern Colorado. In 
approximately 1 790, the northern Comanche bands, 
perhaps responding to the military presojres 
imposed by the Spanish, made an alliance with the 
Kiowa, an alliance that was never broken. They 
were generally friendly to the Americans, but 
became bitter enemies of the Texans, by whom 
they were dispossessed of their best hunting 
grounds. By the early nineteenth century the bison 
herds were greatly diminished on the southern 
Plains and the Comanches increasingly turned to 
raiding to augment their economy. 

In 1835, the Comanches made their first treaty 
with the government. By the Treaty of Medicine 
Lodge in 1867 they agreed to go on their assigned 
reservation between the Washita and Red Rivers in 
southwestern Oklahoma. It was not until 1875 that 
they settled on this land. 

The Comanches ruled the Great Plains, Texas 
and the Southwest during the eighteenth and 
nineteenth centuries. They became the greatest 
horsemen of the plains and were frequently called 
the "Lords of the Plains." They were one of the 
most powerful tribes. Today the tribe is located in 
the southwest area of Oklahoma and their tribal 
complex is located in Lawton, Oklahoma. Their 
tribal membership is approximately 8,000 people [in 
1983]. 



APPLICATION:

DELAWARE HISTORY 



CONCEPT: 

The impact of the Delaware Tribe has been felt ail over the United States. 



PRESENTATION: 

The earliest confirmed and recorded 
knowledge of the Delaware Tribe was in 1 682 when 
they had their Council Fire at Shackamaxon, 
Pennsylvania (now a suburb of Philadelphia). 
However, it is believed the Delaware were probably 
one of the tribes who met the Pilgrims at Plymouth 
Rock in 1620. According to the description of the 
Pilgrims concerning time, location and customs, the 
Delawares* dwelling range was in the Delaware 
valleys of Pennsylvania and Virginia, southeast of 
New York state, and in Delaware, Maryland, and 
New Jersey. 

At one time, the Delaware Tribe was the 
largest Indian confederacy on the Eastern 
Seaboard. Their population at that time was 
approximately 20,000 or 30,000 persons. They 
referred to themselves as the "Real People," the 
"Only People," the Delaware, or Lenni Lenape (la 
nop a). The language stock of the Delaware is 
Algonqulan which is shared with the Coney, 
Shawnee, and Mohican tribes. 

The Delaware made a treaty with William Penn 
in Pennsylvania in 1682. in 1751 they crossed the 
headwaters of the Allegheny River and settled in 
that area. At this time settlements sprang up with 
Huron Indians in east Ohio and later with the 
Munsee and Mohican tribes. This led to a slow 
migration westward. By 1835 most of the tribe had 
gathered on a reservation in Kansas. There were 
so many Delaware that it took three days and three 
nights to cross the Mississippi River. Although at 
different times the Delawares received lands in 
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kansas, and Missouri through 
treaties, the land was always taken back by the 
Government. 

The Delaware lived in log houses or bark 
houses. They were a non-nomadic tribe. The army 
lived in "foxhuts" patterned after the Delaware 
dwellings. Wampum was used for trading 



purposes; it was comparable to money of today. 
The Delaware had three clans: the Turtle Clan (the 
people of wisdom); the Wolf Clan (scouts who 
patrolled the area of the village); and the Turkey 
Clan (farmers who sustained the tribe). 

The Wala Olum or "creation" story of the 
Delaware is complex. This story, written on animal 
hides or skin, has been preserved by historians. It 
is the only written or recorded creation story of any 
Indian tribe. It is located, In part, at the Heye 
Foundation in New York City and at the 
Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. 

In 1867 the Delaware moved to Indian Territory 
and incorporated with the Cherokee Nation. These 
Delaware are called the Bartlesville Delaware or 
Eastern Delaware. The Cherokees count the 
Eastern Delaware on their own tribal rolls. During 
the second half of the 1800's the tribe split in half, 
with one band of Delaware affiliating with the 
Caddo and Wichita tribes in western Oklahoma. 
These are known as the Anadarko or Western 
Delaware or sometimes the Absentee Delaware. 
Both bands of Delaware have been allotted lands 
with respective groups of other Indians. 

Religion among the Delaware people is carried 
out through the Native American Church (Peyote 
Religion and Christianity). Most Delaware will not 
integrate these two religions. Today the Delaware 
language is still intact and the tribe has 
approximately 800 enrolled members and 2,000 
descendants. 

It has been said about the Delaware that they 
are "indeed a rich people because of their deeds 
and traditions of a heroic past." The Delaware 
people have probably left more names on the 
geography of the United States than any other 
tribe. They lived in ten different states in America 
and blazed the path for exploration of many more 
states.

FT. SILL APACHE HISTORY 



CONCEPT: 



Endurance is a trait of the Ft. Sili Apache Tribe of Oklahoma. 



PRESENTATION: 

The Ft. Siil Apache are descendants of a 
group of Chiricahua Apache who declined to return 
to the Southwest when their status as prisoners of 
war was terminated In 1913. Before the disruption 
of their traditional way of life the Chiricahua 
occupied territory in southwestern New Mexico, 
and adjacent parts of Sonora and Chihuahua. The 
Chiricahua prisoners of war derived from ail three 
of the Chiricahua bands, sometimes called the 
Eastern, Central and Southern bands. 

The Chiricahua Apache called themselves 
W'de, which may be translated as "the people." The 
term, Apache, is probably derived from the Zuni 
term, apachu, meaning enemy, and which was 
applied to them by the Spanish. The name 
Chiricahua comes from the Chiricahua Mountains 
of southeastern Arizona where one of the three 
bands often took refuge. The present Ft. Sili 
Apache Tribe is so called because members of the 
tribe have lived on or near the Ft. Sill military 
reservation in Oklahoma since 1894. 

The Chiricahua Apache speak an Athabascan 
language and, along with other Apacheans, are 
believed to have moved to the Southwest in late 
pre-historic times. The bulk of Athabascan 
speakers are still concentrated in the Western 
sub-artic regions of Canada and Alaska. When first 
contacted by Europeans the Chiricahua led a 
wandering, hunting-and-gathering existence 
supplemented by a little subsistence agriculture. 
Their wanderings, however, were not haphazard, 
but were correlated with the cyclical availability of 
food resources within their range. Their early 
relations with the Spanish and Mexicans were at 
first tranquil, but soon came to be marked by 
sporadic guerrilla warfare. Hostilities probably 
developed because the Spanish aligned themselves 
with and did considerable missionizing of the 
agricultural Pueblo tribes, with whom the Apache 
were already at war. Also the impact of stock 
raising, introduced by the Spanish, may have been 
considerable, leading to the depletion of game and 
edible plant resources for the Apache. 

Early relations between the Chiricahua and the 



Americans were usually good. Each group saw In 
the other a valuable ally in their struggles with the 
Mexicans, as well as a potentially formidable 
enemy. The Chiricahua, however, saw no reason 
to end hostilities with the Mexicans at the end of 
the Mexican-American War in 1848. Also 
Americans continued to trade with them for the 
booty acquired south of the border. Raiding 
intensified and became a regular economic activity 
as the availability of game decreased. 

The only treaty between the United States and 
the Apache of Arizona and New Mexico was signed 
at Santa Fe on July 1 , 1850. It provided for a tribal 
reservation, the boundaries of which were to be 
fixed by the government. Delays in designating 
these boundary lines and conflicts of authority 
between military and civilian administrators of 
Indian affairs in New Mexico and Arizona 
contributed to the unsettled conditions, and for 
many years the tribe led a precarious existence. 

Reservation boundaries were eventually 
established, but were subsequently altered 
repeatedly. The composition of Apache tribes and 
bands occupying the various reservations also 
fluctuated as groups tried in different ways to adapt 
to changing conditions. Little attention was paid to 
the needs or desires of any of these Apache 
groups. They were repeatedly removed from fertile 
or minerai-rich lands that settlers and miners 
wished to occupy. Often they were displaced to 
desert areas which they were expected to farm. 
They received little farm equipment and even less 
instruction. After considerable negotiations, the 
Chiricahua Apaches were given a reservation in 
their old homeland near Apache Pass In 1873. 
Conditions began to improve. The famous chief, 
Cochise, who had long refused to accept a 
reservation elsewhere, died there in 1874 during an 
interval of peace. 

The Chiricahua Apache were making progress 
in establishing homes and farming operations when 
suddenly, in 1875, they were moved to the San 
Carlos Reservation on the Gila River, farther west in 
Arizona. This move was very much against their 

, si 



will. The government had adopted a policy of 
concentrating all of the Indian tribes in a region on 
one reservation. Coal was soon discovered on this 
new reservation and there was in influx of non- 
Indian miners into the region. Water rights on the 
Gila River were also taken up by non-Indian people, 
leaving the Indians without any means of irrigating 
their fields and gardens. 

During the next ten years, war parties under 
various leaders such as Victorio and Geronimo 
carried out numerous raids and hostile actions in 
the hope of forcing the government to return them 
to their old reservation. The last of these warring 
groups was talked into surrendering to forces under 
the command of General Nelson Miles in 1886. 
Geronimo, Chief Naiche, and all of their band of 
people numbering about 340 people In all, were 
taken as prisoners of war to Fort Marion in Florida. 
People died in such numte s that, within a year, 
they were transferred to Mount Vernon Barracks in 
Alabama. There they remained for seven years. 

A number of people interested in the Apache 
prisoners for humanitarian reasons took up their 
cause until, by order of the Secretary of the Interior 
in 1894, they were brought by a special train to Ft. 
Sill in Oklahoma Territory. They numbered 296 
men, women and children - about 70 families. 
They arrived with few clothes or personal 
belongings. They remained prisoners of war at Ft. 
Sill until 1913. Their first three years at Ft. Sill, they 
were under the charge of Captain Hugh L. Scott, a 
man who was understanding of Indian people and 
concerned for their welfare. He located them in 
twelve small villages scattered about the military 
reservation. For the first winter, they lived in brush 
wickiups. The following spring, the men went to 
work building houses and fences and breaking 
ground for gardens. 

During their years as prisoners, they engaged 
in seasonal work under military supervision, cutting 
and baling prairie hay for sale, raising and selling 
melons and vegetables, and caring for cattle 
purchased for them. They kept a herd of cattle on 
th^ open range. This herd became one of the 
finest In the Southwest and within a few years was 
bringing in a good revenue from annual sales. 
These Chiricahua Apaches were the first to raise 
kaiffir corn for forage In southwestern Oklahoma. 
Some of the leaders enlisted as army scouts. 
Naiche, the hereditary chief, was given more power 
than other men - including Geronimo, the famous 
war chief. 

Although living conditions were generally 
favorable at Ft. Siil, many of the older Indians 
continued to press for their return to the Southwest. 



Finally, in 1913, they were released as prisoners of 
war through an act of Congress and given the 
choice of remaining in the Ft. Sill area or of 
removing to the Mescalero Reservation in New 
Mexico. A total of 181 persons moved to New 
Mexico, and 81 persons remained in Oklahoma and 
were given 80 acre allotments on land purchased 
from the Kiowa and Comanche tribes through the 
sale of the Apache cattle herd. Homes were built 
on their allotments, and the new town on the Rock 
Island Railroad in the area was given the name, 
Apache. 

The Oklahoma Chiricahua, increasingly known 
by the term, Ft. Sill Apache, gradually adopted a life 
style similar to that of other rural Indians In their 
area - the Comanche, Kiowa, and Kiowa-Apache. 
However, the Ft. Sill Apache have had few activities 
calling for participation of all of their small tribe as 
a group. They have had no tribal encampment or 
annual pow-wow, nor traditional religious gathering. 
Most Ft. Sill Apache became members of the Dutch 
Reformed Church. For many years they had no 
formal tribal organization. 

In recent years, however, there has been an 
awakening of tribal consciousness and a desire to 
be known as a distinct group among Oklahoma 
tribes. A tribal constitution was adopted on 
October 30, 1976, at which time a majority of voters 
chose the name, Ft. Sill Apache, as the official 
name of their tribe. Some tribal members still would 
prefer to be called Chiricahua or Warm Springs 
Apache. At present [in 1983] there are 220 enrolled 
members, of which approximately two-thirds live 
and work outside of Oklahoma. A sizeable number 
of persons are eligible to enroll, as members of the 
Ft. Sill Apache Tribe, but have not yet done so. 
Tribal programs for health and economic 
development are now being planned. 

The Ft. Sill Apache have diverged considerably 
from their kindred in the Southwest, but still retain 
some knowledge of their language and of traditional 
ways. Many families interact regularly with relatives 
and friends on the Mescalero and other Apache 
reservations In the Southwest. The Fire Dance, a 
showy accompaniment of the young woman's 
puberty ceremonial In traditional Apache culture, is 
put on in Oklahoma mainly for entertainment' at 
other Indian pow-wows and at the Anadarko Indian 
Exposition. Some Ft. Sill Apache make dance 
costumes and do beadwork in the traditional 
Chiricahua style. Many have intermarried with 
Indians of other tribes, yet a strong nucleus retains 
a hold on their distinctive origin and works to build 
a strong modern identity.

POWER, POLITICS, AND JUSTICE 



CONCEPT: 

The imprisonment and ultimate release of the Chiricahuas (Ft. Sill Apaches) provides a study in 
power, politics, and participation in the pursuit of justice. 



PRESENTATION: 

Although philanthropic societies continued to 
exercise a vigilant watch against any infringement 
of the rights of the Apache prisoners, pressure for 
their release slackened between 1894 and 1909 
because the Chiricahuas had been promised 
permanent homes at Ft. Sill on the assumption that 
this army post would be dissolved. 

Scott Ferris, who represented the Fifth 
Congressional District of Oklahoma, strongly 
opposed the dissolution of the Fort. Knowing that 
the earlier promise to make Ft. Sill Into a permanent 
home for the Chiricahuas would interfere with its 
continuance as a fort, Ferris sponsored legislation 
to remove all the Chiricahuas to the Mescalero 
Reservation in New Mexico. This legislative 
maneuver may have worked had not a strong 
minority of the Apaches demanded allotments and 



freedom at Ft. Sill. Fortunately for all the 
Chiricahuas, officials representing the Indian Rights 
Commission, the Board of Indian Commissioners, 
the Interior Department, and the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs continued to exercise pressure on the 
government for a fair settlement. 

This legislative maneuver by Ferris was only 
one of a series of legislative power plays which 
sought to deal with the plight of the prisoners in a 
way that would be most advantageous to him. 

In 1910 U. S. Senator Robert L Owen of 
Oklahoma Introduced legislation to allow the 
Secretary of Interior to provide for allotments of 60 
to 80 acres of farming land to each Ft. Sill Apache 
prisoner. This land was to come from the military 
reserve or from land previously ceded by the Kiowa 
and Comanche Tribes. Both Minnesota Senator 




ERLC 



BEST COPY AVAILABLE 72 84 



Moses E. Clapp, Chairman of the Senate 
Committee on Indian Affairs, and Interior Secretary 
Richard A. Ballinger strongly supported this 
legislation. Ballinger endorsed the legislation with 
a statement to the extent that the government had 
"solemnly promised" that not only would Ft. Sill be 
their "permanent home," but that they would never 
again be subject to relocation. According to 
Ballinger the original reservation had been nearly 
doubled for the express purpose of settling the 
Apache prisoners there permanently. 

Ferris offered counter legislation that would 
empower the Interior Secretary to grant allotments 
of 160 acres of agricultural land or 320 acres of 
non-arable grazing land anywhere on the public 
domain of the United States or Distric- -J Alaska. 
At the same time, Ferris offered, as a delaying 
tactic, contingency legislation, empowering the 
Interior Secretary to explore a suitable reservation 
for allocation purposes. The Secretary was to 
report back to the House of Representatives. 

Shortly after the first of the year, Ferris again 
introduced legislation authorizing the Secretary of 
War to grant freedom to those Apaches electing to 
return to Mescalero and to allow those Apaches 
desiring to remain at Ft. Sill to do so under such 
regulations which the War Department might 
prescribe. Of course, Ferris knew at this time the 
War Department planned to keep Ft. Sill as a 
military base. 

Fearing that the Commissioner of Indian Affairs 
would prevail on Congress to accept his view that 
Ft. Sill allotments be made to those Apaches 
desiring to stay there, Ferris arranged a meeting 
with representatives o* the Board of Indian 
Commissioners and the Indian Rights Association. 
Here a compromise was reached to the effect that 
allotments might be made from outside the military 
reserve to those Apaches desiring to remain in the 
Ft. Sili area. 



On May 10, 1912, Oklahoma Senator Thomas 
P. Gore introduced legislation to the effect that 
those prisoners desiring to return to Mescalero be 
immediately released while those desiring to stay in 
Oklahoma could remain at Ft. Sill until 80 to 160 
acres of land could be purchased from Kiowa and 
Comanche allotments for their relocation. One 
hundred thousand dollars was to be appropriated 
for relocation of the prisoners to Mescalero while 
two hundred fifty thousand dollars was to be 
appropriated to purchase allotments for the 
prisoners wishing to remain in Oklahoma. 

Although Scott Ferris threw his support behind 
the Senate legislation initiated by Gore, passage of 
the bill was impeded when Representative James 
Mann of Illinois vigorously objected because of the 
disproportionate amount of money ($250,000) 
allocated to the minority wishing to remain in 
Oklahoma as compared to the $100,000 to be 
allocated for removal of those wishing to return to 
Mescalero. 

To further complicate passage of the bill, a 
group of stockmen from Roswell, New Mexico, in 
an effort to protect their leases and profits on the 
Mescalero Reservation, circulated a petition urging 
that all Apache prisoners be kept in Oklahoma and 
that all tillable land on Mescalero be divided among 
the Indians there, with the remaining lands to be 
turned into a national park. For this effort they 
solicited and obtained the support of New Mexico 
Senator Albert Fall whose son-in-law was trying to 
lease grazing land on the Mescalero Reservation. 

Finally, through the effort of Senators Curtis of 
Kansas and Clapp of Minnesota compromises were 
agreed upon and the Indian Appropriation Bill 
became law on August 24, 1912. Essentially, the 
final settlement contained the provisions of the 
Gore Bill. In April of 1913, the 176 Apaches who 
had been imprisoned for 27 years received their 
freedom at Mescalero, while the remaining 88 
received allotments to remain in Oklahoma.

A SHORT HISTORY OF THE KIOWA TRIBE 



CONCEPT: 

The Kiowa people formed one of the greatest tribes of the Plains. 
PRESENTATION: 



The Kiowa people trace their origin to the 
northern plains region somewhere on the 
Yellowstone River in western Montana before 1700. 
The Kiowa eventually migrated southward to what 
Is now southwestern Colorado, northeastern New 
Mexico, south central Kansas and eventually to 
central and western Oklahoma. The Kiowa have 
been linguistically linked with both the Tanoan and 
the Shoshonean stocks. 

The Kiowa Tribe of the Great Plains in the early 
nineteenth century represented a society which 
successfully combined culture traits of European 
origin with aboriginal patterns to form a new and 
distinctive culture. The dominant series of culture 
traits of European origin center on the horse, which 
gave this nomadic tribe of the Plains the mobility 
necessary for large-scale bison hunting as an 
economic base. The horse was acquired by the 
Kiowa while living in the Black Hills region of 
present day South Dakota. 

It is within the distinctive and specialized 
ecologic area of the plains that the Kiowa had, by 
1850, developed a highly specialized way of life 
centered on two animals; the domesticated horse, 
introduced into the Plains in the seventeenth 
century, and the bison, native to the Plains. The 
horse, as it became available in large numbers, 
provided the mobility necessary to sustain large 
numbers of people whose existence depended on 
procuring quantities of bison from the large 
nomadic herds. Around this horse-bison complex, 
the Kiowa geared their whole society. Their religion 
and their understanding of the world about them 
reflected their daily concern for these two animals. 

To sustain their way of life, the Kiowas, like the 
majority of other tribes in the Plains, emphasized 

APPLICATION: 



the economic motive, as seen in the raiding party 
for more horses, guns, etc. and the social motive of 
improving one's position in the society. Both 
contributed to the emphasis placed on warfare by 
the people of the Plains. 

With the building of railroads across the Plains, 
the movement of immigrant wagon trains, and the 
beginnings of European settlement on the Plains, 
warfare by the Kiowa and other tribes became a 
unifying factor in survival. 

After the battle of the Washita (Texas) in 1868, 
during General Custer's southern campaign, the 
Kiowas, Kiowa-Apaches, and Comanches were 
forced onto a reservation near Fort Sill (Oklahoma) 
established under the 1867 Treaty of Medicine 
Lodge. Even after this, Kiowa defiance continued 
and in 1871 during Kiowa raids into Texas, Kiowa 
chiefs were captured and imprisoned. Military 
defeats and the disappearance of the buffalo ended 
Kiowa resistance. Although the messianic "Ghost 
Dance" religion caused a brief resurgence of hope, 
the collapse of the economic base of the Kiowas 
and the reservation system radically undermined 
the nomadic culture of the Kiowas forever. 

Today [in 1983], the Kiowa, numbering over 
9,000, are located in Kiowa, Caddo, and Comanche 
counties between the Washita and Red Rivers in 
southwest Oklahoma. They have preserved much 
of their tradition and history. A strong sense of 
tribal identity continues to exist in the tribe. The 
influence of outstanding Kiowa people has been felt 
in all areas of life such as education, medicine, 
literature, music and dance, etc. The tribal complex 
is located in Carnegie, Oklahoma, where services 
provided by the tribe are a model to all other tribes 
of Oklahoma. 



ACTIVITIES : 

1. Take your class to the tribal complex in Carnegie (see resources). Arrange to have a 
guided tour to see all the services available through the tribe to the people. 



2. Invite the Kiowa Tribal Chairman to visit your class to discuss tribal culture.

shelters, and perforrr â€¢ household duties. The 
tools and implements used by the Wichita people 
were made by them from bone, stone, wood, and 
pottery. They also made many articles which were 
woven. The Wichltas practiced abundant tattooing 
and were often described as being tattooed from 
head to foot with many Intricate designs, 

Wichita traditions indicate that their tribe 




History reveals the stability of a people. 

PRESENTATION: 

In the old days, the Wichita people called 
themselves Kitikiti'sh or Kirikirish, which we think 
meant "preeminent men" or "paramount among 
men." This Is such an old word that It dates almost 
to forgotten time. At that time, the Kitikiti'sh lived 
in the heartland of North America - in the rich 
fertile valleys of the south-central plains in what is 
now Kansas and Oklahoma. 



The name Wichita seems to have originated 
from the Choctaw term Nia chitch which means Big 
Arbor. This term probably came about because the 
Wichita people buHt and lived in grass lodges. 
These grass lodges were made by erecting a 
framework of poles placed in a circle in the ground, 
uniting the tops in an oval shape, binding the tops 
together with numerous withes or wattles, and 
nicely thatching everything with grass. When a 
Wichita grass lodge was completed, it made a very 
comfortable domicile. The lodges were about 
twenty-five feet in diameter and about twenty feet 
high. From a distance the grass lodges looked 
very much like a group of hay stacks! A fire hole 
was sunk In the center of a Wichita home and their 
doorways faced east and west. 

Skin tlpfs were used by the Wichrtas when they 
were away from their homes. The Wichrtas were a 
sedentary and agricultural people, but they did hunt 
as weil. The men were the protectors, hunters, and 
warriors. The women did the farming, built the 



migrated southward from the North and the East, 
in 1541, the explorer Coronado came upon some 
native people who were Wichltas or some very 
closely related tribe. In 1719, Bernard de la Harpe 
listed the Qusita (Wichita) Indians as an important 
tribe among the Caddoan tribes. The Wichita Tribe 
is very closely related to the Pawnee Tribe and to 
this day these two tribes maintain a close 
relationship and entertain each other annually in an 
Indian Pow-Now or some other celebration. One 
year the Wichltas entertain the Pawnee Tribe at 
their home grounds near Anadarko, Oklahoma and, 
the next year, the Pawnees entertain the Wichita 
Tribe in Pawnee, Oklahoma. 

The Wichltas raised corn, pumpkins, and 
tobacco and they traded with other tribes. They 
had no clan system - but were extremely devoted 
to ceremonial dances. They had the Horn Dance 
which is similar to the Green Corn Dance of the 
eastern tribes. Industrious, reliable, and friendly 
people, their whole tribe participated in such 



ERLC 



77 

89 



ceremonials as the Ghost Dance and the Peyote 
Rite. 

Around 1850, the Wichita Tribe had moved 
from near the Red River Into the region of the 
Wichita Mountains. Their main village was located 
a short distance from what is now Ft. Sill, 
Oklahoma. In 1859, the Wichitas moved to their 
permanent location south of the Canadian River 
near the present Caddo-Grady county line. A 
reservation, known as the Wichita-Caddo 
reservation, was established in 1872 consisting of 

APPLICATION: 



743,610 acres of land. At that time, there were 
approximately 500 Wichita people in their tribe. 

There are several places in Oklahoma and 
nearby states which to this day bear the name, 
Wichita. A few examples of this are the city of 
Wichita in Kansas; the Wichita Mountain Range in 
Oklahoma; and Wichita Falls, a city in Texas. 
Today the Wichita Tribe maintains their tribal 
complex in Anadarko, Oklahoma, where many of 
their tribal members live. Today [in 1983] there are 
about 1,168 members of the Wichita Tribe.

WHATS IN A NAME? (WICHITA) 



CONCEPT: 

The names of American Indian tribes can undergo many changes. 
PRESENTATION: 



The Wichita Indians have had a long history of 
name changing. By this it is meant that no one 
knows for sure where the tribe got its name 
"Wichita." It seems over the years each tribe had a 
different name for the Wichitas, naming them 
according to description and in their own language. 
Pronunciation varied so that the spelling was 
changed. 

For example, a Frenchman, Claude du Tisne, 
in 1719, while visiting the Osages was allowed to 
go over to the Wichitas and he claimed a part of 
Kansas for the King of France. He did not call the 
natives he found there Wichitas. He called them 
Paniouassas, a name the French were already 
using on their maps at that time. Paniouassa was a 
French form of the name used by several Siouan 
Tribes. It was also written Pan-nye, Wacene, Pacin 
Wasabe, and Pane Wasabe. Riggs' Sioux 
dictionary defines Was-sa-pe-dan as "black bear." 
Because of the association with "Black Bear" the 
name was shortened to Pan-Wasaba t which Du 
Tisne and other Frenchmen wrote Paniouasa, 
Paniassa, and Panioussa. And eventually 
shortened to Pani Noir (result of deleting the word 
"bear") in French, meaning "Black Paunie." The 
name was applied broadly and included the 
Wichitas. 

Another Wichita name association came from 
the word "bear" (Kirikurus or Kirkurukstu) which 
means "bear eyes" because of the impression that 
the Wichitas had "eyes like bears." This was 
probably due to their practice of painting circles 
around their eyes. This may also explain the story 
that the Wichitas were called "coon eyes" by the 
Pawnees. However, the word Kirikurukstu means 
"south." This interpretation probably resulted from 
the Pawnees of the Piatt using Kirikurukstu 
meaning "toward or with the Wichitas," a word that 
eventually came to mean "South." 

In 1719, Bernard de la Harpe, a Frenchman 
from New Orleans, was probably the first person to 
use the name which became Wichita. He referred 
to the tribe asOs/fas, also written as Quistas and 



Nusitas. He also used Quiscasquiris, another 
name which has been used to identify the Wichitas. 

Another story finds the Wichita being called 
We-Chate or We-Chata (We being translated as 
"water" and Chata as "red") translated to "Red River 
People" which in a sense was for the Wichitas who 
came from the Red River area in Texas. A group of 
Creek Indians accompanying a Lieutenant N. 
Seawell gave them this name. 

It was not unusual at that time to refer to 
Indian settlements by direction, but again the name 
of direction depends on the direction from which a 
person speaks. For example, the Wichita have 
been called by several tribes "People of the South" 
and "People of the North," depending on the 
direction where the tribes were located in relation to 
the Wichitas. 

Tattooing was done by both men and women 
in the tribe. Each person considered tattooing as 
their chief ornament. The practice of tattooing 
became the source for their name Pani pique. The 
Comanches and the Kiowas called the Wichitas by 
names meaning "tattooed people." In Comanche, 
they were called Do'Kana. In Kiowa, they were 
called Doguot or Doguat. In French, this became 
Pahni pique or Pan Pique because "all of them are 
painted." The Spaniards occasionally called them 
Jumanos or Humanos, which they also applied to 
other tribes. 

In the early 19th century, American travelers 
gave the French name Pani pique a phonetic 
English spelling and thus the meaning was lost. 
Names like "Paunee Pick," "Paunee Picts, M or just 
"Picks" resulted with the Americans translating the 
namo into "Freckled Paunees," "Speckled Paunees, M 
and "Prickled Paunees." These translations carried 
the Implication that the Wichitas were the "tattooed 
Paunees." Thus, these Panis pique or Paunee Picts 
became known as the Wichitas. (Pani pique means 
the "tattooed people" or "painted faces." The name 
Wichita does not mean this. It is probably a 
Choctaw term meaning Wia Chitch or Big Arbor.)

THE CHICKASAWS LONG AGO 



CONCEPT: 

History began long ago for the Chickasaws. 
PRESENTATION: 

The Chickasaw people, at the arrival of the 
Europeans, occupied the northeastern Mississippi 
region in an area which extended eastward into 
what is now Alabama, northward through western 
Tennessee, and as far west as the Ohio River. The 
first Chickasaw settlement east of the Mississippi 
River was in present-day Madison County, Alabama 
in what is called the Chickasaw Old Fields. As the 
Chickasaw people became established in the 
region, they grouped in small villages in 
northwestern Mississippi. 

The Chickasaw were excellent hunters and 
fishers. It was not unknown for hunting parties to 
range far westward as presently Oklahoma, 
Agriculture was practiced mainly by the women of 
the villages who grew corn, pumpkins and squash. 

According to tribal traditions and to actual 
recorded history, the Chicksaw were never known 
to have lost a battle. They were a very war-like 
people. In James Adair's writings, he relates 
various episodes in which Chickasaw men would 
run an enemy literally to death. They were among 
the fastest and most tireless runners of the day. It 
is said that a Chickasaw man could run, non-stop, 
all day. 

It was the Chickasaws' fighting capabilities and 
cunning planning which gave them the reputation 
for being unconquered and unconquerable. Unlike 
other neighboring tribes, the Chickasaw sided with 
the English rather than the French when the 
Europeans came into that portion of the country. 
According to many historians it is the Chickasaws 
who receive credit for the United States being an 
English-speaking, rather than a French-speaking 
nation. Because of the Chickasaw alliance with the 
Englishmen during the 1 700's, the French and their 
Indian allies from other tribes were repeatedly 
defeated in engagement after engagement. It was 
not unheard of for a very small group of Chickasaw 
braves and English trar^rs to defeat, in battle, a 
much larger group of French soldiers and Indian 
braves. 

When the United States gained its 
independence, its government dealt with the 



various Indian nations on a government-to- 
government basis; as one nation to another. The 
early white leaders had a great deal of respect for 
the Indians and their ways of governing themselves. 
However, as time went on and the arrival of more 
people from Europe caused a need for more space, 
the attitudes of the white leaders began to change. 
Under the leadership of President Andrew Jackson, 
the United States began its plans to occupy the 
lands of the Chickasaw and other tribes In the area. 

By the 1830's, the Chickasaw had accepted 
and adopted many of the white man's ways. They 
were rapidly losing their old tribal traditions and 
becoming educated in the modern ways of life. 
Because their leaders were shrewd bargainers, the 
Chickasaw were among the last tribes to be 
removed from their traditional lands in the east. 
Their removal treaty with the federal government, 
the Treaty of Doaksville, was signed in 1837. This 
treaty, between the Chickasaw leaders and 
spokesmen of the Choctaw Nation, called for the 
Chickasaw Nation to pay the Choctaw Nation 
$530,000 in exchange for the central and western 
portion of the Choctaw Nation's grant for lands In 
Indian Territory. The vast migration of the 
Chickasaw people began shortly after the terms of 
the treaty were made known. 

The Chickasaws settled in the Choctaw Nation 
during the winter of 1837-38. Feeling that they 
were not properly represented in the Choctaw 
government, the Chickasaw people decided to 
re-establish their own government in the new lands. 
In June of 1855, the Chickasaw and Choctaw 
Commissioners signed an agreement which allowed 
the Chickasaw Nation to establish its own 
government in the new lands. In 1856, the members 
of the Chickasaw Nation adopted their own 
constitution and the formation of the new tribal 
government was assured. The first council house 
was built at Good Springs on Pennington Creek. 
(Good Springs was later re-named Tishomingo in 
honor of the famous Chickasaw war chief who died 
on the Trail of Tears.) In later years, a capitol 
building was built in Tishomingo (1896). This

THE YUCHI (EUCHEE) PEOPLE 



CONCEPT: 

The Yuchi people were "Children of the Sun." 
PRESENTATION: 

The following information was gathered by Yuchi 
people in the Sapulpa area for the curriculum 
guide The Oklahoma Indian and Nature Guide in 
1977: 

The Yuchi call themselves the "Children of the 
Sun." According to legend, the monthly afflux of 
the sun - considered to be of the female sex - fell 
to the earth, and from this event the Yuchi people 
explained their origin. 

When the Yuchi begin to tell about how they 
and other tribes around them came into being, they 
usually begin by saying: "How the people had 
come upon the earth. The Shawnee came from 
above. The Creeks came from the ground. The 
Choctaw came from the water. The Yuchi came 
from the sun." The proper name for the entire 
Yuchi people is Tsoyaha Ugeeha which means 
"Children of the Sun." 

It is believed that the Yuchi migrated to the 
United States from the Bahamas. Signs indicate 
that before the Yuchi came to the Bahamas they 
were associated with some Indians of South 
America. For example, the Yuchi had a custom of 
pounding corn for making bread and grits; the 
Indians of South America had this same custom. 
The Yuchi and South American Indians also 
dressed similarly. The South American Indians also 
made clothes like the Yuchi Indians. 

The Yuchi had already lived in the southeast 
for several centuries when the first Europeans came 
here in the 1500's. Their towns extended over 
much of the present states of South Carolina, 
Georgia, Alabama, and Tennessee. 

In 1540 the Spanish explorers encountered 
several of the Yuchi towns and described these 
people as being by far the most civilized of any 
people they had found. The explorers found 
permanent houses in large, well laid out towns in 
which there was such a high degree of social order 
that the towns were not walled but were all open. 

The Yuchi were cloth weavers and metal 
workers, so the Spanish naturally suspected that 
they had gold, although none was to be found. 



The various Yuchian town kings had the policy of 
meeting the Spanish In peace, supplying them with 
food and other necessities and helping them to 
move on as quickly as possible. The town kings 
evidently worked In close cooperation in this regard 
and were successful in leading the Spanish away 
from what are now believed to have been the more 
important towns. 

When the Spanish arrived, the Yuchi were 
under the leadership of a young queen who 
attempted to deal with the Spanish by accepting 
them with kindness and supplying them with food 
and shelter. In return for her kindness, the Queen 
herself was finally seized as a hostage and taken 
with the Spanish to command the burden bearers 
and to prevent Indian attacks. From her town on 
the Savannah River, the Queen led the Spanish 
northward on their quest for gold and abandoned 
them In the Great Smoky Mountains. Apparently, 
she was deliberately leading them away from the 
other large Yuchian towns in middle and upper 
Georgia. 

Since the period of the earliest European 
contact with the Yuchi, this tribe has been known 
for its persistence in remaining distinct from other 
groups and for its reluctance to accept the white 
man and his culture. It was well known to early 
English and Spanish officials that the Yuchi were 
peaceably inclined and often valuable as allies 
against other tribes. But it was also equally well 
known that the Yuchi did not become very closely 
allied with the white man in any of the power 
struggles of the 1700's. 

There is abundant evidence that, from that 
time on, the Yuchi followed a very definite policy in 
their dealing* with the English colonial officials. 
This was to ave as little to do with them as 
possible. 

There is no proof that the Yuchi ever engaged 
in an offensive war. There is abundant evidence 
that at the end of the 1700's they were unique 
among the Southeastern Indian peoples In that they 
were still supporting themselves by farming and 
had not become economically dependent upon the 



96 



white man's trade or the sale of Indian lands. 

The Yuchi were once a very powerful tribe, 
numbering close to 40,000 people. The Yuchi 
maintain that they were originally one of the large 
tribes of the Southeast who suffered oppression at 
the hands of encroaching tribes of the Muskogean 
stock. They became much reduced and were 
finally incorporated, together with the Shawnee, into 
the loose coalition of northeastern tribes known in 
colonial history as the Creek Confederacy or the 
Creek Nation. 

President George Washington named 
Benjamin Hawkins as the first Federal agent for the 
Southeastern tribes. Because of the determined 
Yuchi independence, Hawkins reported them to be 
the most difficult to work with. Hawkins attempted 
to rectify this situation by considering the Yuchi as 
part of the Creek Nation. 

Hawkins had already selected some Creek 
chiefs who were amenable to the persuasive 
method of giving and outright bribery which 
Hawkins adopted. In this way, the Creek Nation - 
or at least, the ruling element of it could be 
coaxed to cede their lands. If the Yuchi did not 
comply, they could easily be ignored since the 
various other tribes which comprised the Creek 
Nation far outnumbered them. 

Following the final sale of Creek lands in 1832, 
the Yuchi protested. They were joined by many 
dissatisfied members of the Creek tribes. Their 
resistance and individual "atrocities" served as a 
justification in 1832 to remove them by force to the 
newly granted Creek lands in Oklahoma. 

APPLICATION: 



In the year 1836, about 1,200 surviving 
members of the Yuchi tribes were herded onto two 
boats and transported under extreme hardships to 
Ft. Smith, Arkansas, where they were unloaded. 
They were left to fend for themselves on their way 
150 miles farther west to their new lands. 

The Removal did not affect the Yuchi's life 
style to any great extent. They had known how to 
best use the environment in their old homeland, so 
they quickly adapted to their new home in 
Oklahoma. Fortunately, the area turned out to be 
quite similar to the Yuchi's former homeland. Due 
to the fact that the land, many of the animals and 
much of the plant life was similar to what they had 
left behind, the Yuchi did not have to make many 
changes after moving. 

In 1867, the Creek Nation was organized under 
a written constitution. There were 44 towns 
comprising the entire nation. The Yuchi settlements 
were combined into one Yuchi town. The Yuchi 
town is the fifteenth of the 44 towns. Today [in 
1983], it is called Yuchitown Number Fifteen. The 
Yuchi people today are primarily settled in the cities 
of Keliyville, Sapulpa, Bristow, and Mounds in 
northeastern Oklahoma. 

The Yuchi learned that too close association 
with the invading white man would, in the end, 
destroy their culture, if not their entire population. 
Their adherence to a deep belief in the old culture, 
especially their religion, has enabled the small 
group of Yuchi Indians of Oklahoma to keep much 
of their original heritage intact to the present day.

UKB CHEROKEE 

TRIBE NAME: The word Keetoowah is closely interwoven in the fabric of Cherokee history 
and means "Principal People." Kltuhwa was the name of the main town or seat of authority, 
and was also one of America's most ancient tribal towns, located In western North Carolina. 

LANGUAGE: The Cherokee belong to the Iroquoian Stock linguistic family. The middle 
dialect, or Kituhwa, was originally spoken in Tuckasegee and Tennessee and became both 
the written and spoken language of the Western Cherokee. The softest and most musical of 
all Cherokee dialects, it lacks the English H R" sound. 

HISTORY: In 1859, the full-Wood Keetoowah organized and adopted their first written 
constitution. Calling themselves the Keetoowah Society, only full-Woods were eligiWe for 
membership. â€¢ After the Civil War, in which the Keetoowah fought for the Union against the 
mixed-Wood Cherokee, they became a political organization that rigorously sought full-Wood 
equality. â€¢ Years later, Congress passed the Dawes Act, dividing Indian lands into individual 
parcels. The Keetoowah Society was in opposition to this legislation, and in 1901, they split 
over a vote on the issue of land allotments. One group was the Keetoowah Nighthawks, led 
by Redbird Smith. In 1905, the Keetoowah Society Council requested and were granted 
incorporation in Tahiequah. The Keetoowah Society, Inc. divided In 1939 and formed a 
group who later became known as The United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians In 
Oklahoma (UKB). â€¢ in 1950, the two political groups of Keetoowah merged and were 
federally recognized. 

CEREMONIES: The UKB holds an annual tribal celebration at their Tahiequah headquarters. 
Open to the puWic, activities include an all-Indian fiddling contest. 

LANDMARKS: Exhibits at the Cherokee Strip Museum (Perry); the State Museum of History 
(Oklahoma City); and both the Giicrease and Philbrook Museums (Tulsa). 

KEY POPULATION AREAS: Five counties: Adair, Cherokee, Sequoyah, Delaware and 
Mayes. 

TRIBAL ROLL: Approximately 7,438. Two-thirds are full-blood and most can still speak 
Cherokee. 

HEADQUARTERS: Tahiequah, Oklahoma. 




DELAWARE NATION 

TRIBE NAME: The English name Delaware was based on the river named for Lord de la 
V/arr. In early colonial times, this river valley was the tribal center of an area that Included 
present New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York and Delaware. The tribe call themselves 
Lena'pe or LenHena'pe, which is equivalent to "original people." 

LANGUAGE: Belonging to the Algonquian linguistic family, they once were the largest of al! 
Eastern Woodland tribes. 

HISTORY: The Delaware tribe was first encountered by Europeans In 1620 living along the 
Delaware River In and around present-day Vernon, New Jersey, as well as In New York, 
Pennsylvania and Delaware. â€¢ By 1682, they bad concentrated settlements In Pennsylvania, 
where they signed the famous treaty with William Penn. And In 1778, the Delaware were the 
first Indian tribe to sign a treaty with the newly established United States. â€¢ By the 1770s, 
the tribe occupied the country between the Ohio and White Rivers in Indiana. Later \n 1789 ( 
a band of Delaware crossed the Mississippi to escape the Indian wars In Ohio and settle In 
Spanish Territory (now the state of Missouri). Throughout the next 40 years, 13 treaties 
provided for the removal of the Delaware from Missouri to a reservation between the Kansas 
and Missouri state lines. Surrounded by intolerable conditions, the tribe requested to be 
moved. Indian Territory was suggested, and in 1812, they settled in Oklahoma. â€¢ By 1820, 
two bands had found their way to Texas, and in 1859, a group living along the Brazos River 
in Texas moved north with the Caddo and Wichita on the Wichita-Caddo reservation near 
Anadarko, Oklahoma. â€¢ Today, there are two groups of the Delaware In Oklahoma. 

CULTURE: One part of the tribe, known as Registered Delaware, came from their Kansas 
reservation in 1867 and settled with the Cherokee along the Caney River. Their descendants 
live in Washington, Craig, Nowata and Delaware counties. â€¢ The other tribe, federally 
recognized as a separate legal entity, was associated with the Caddo and Wichita tribes In 
West Texas and In 1859 came to the Washita River in Indian Territory. This group called 
themselves "the lost tribe" or "Absentee Delaware Tribe" and are known today as the 
Delaware Tribe of Western Oklahoma.

DELAWARE TRIBE OF EASTERN OKLAHOMA 



TRIBE NAME: The English name Delaware was given the tribe from the river named for 
Lord de la Warr. In early Colonial times, this river valley was the tribal center of an area that 
Included present New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware. The tribe call 
themselves Lenape, meaning "common," or "real people." 

LANGUAGE: Belonging to the Algonquian linguistic group. 

HISTORY: By 1609, the tribe occupied the Delaware River Valley. They were among the 
first Indians to come Into contact with Europeans along the East Coast and were considered 
the "parent from which many tribes had sprung." As a term of respect for the tribe's power 
and position, many Indians called this tribe "Grandfather." â€¢ In 1682, William Penn 
purchased parts of Pennsylvania from the Delaware. â€¢ Pushed further west by Indian wars, 
In 1820 they crossed the Mississippi and settled in Spanish Missouri. The next 40 years 
produced 13 treaties with the U.S. One provided for their removal from Missouri to a 
reservation between the Kansas and Missouri Rivers, which became the focal point in 
disputes between Kansas and Missouri over state boundaries. By 1854, their Kansas 
reservation was reduced greatly. â€¢ In 1866, a treaty allowed them to either stay in Kansas 
and become U.S. citlzens-or move to the Cherokee Nation and retain their tribal affiliation. 
Those who moved became known as the Registered or Eastern Delaware. 

CULTURE: During their move West, they contributed to the history of 10 different states. 
They fought Anglo-American settlement and weathered many moves. Wherever they settled, 
their fields were well cultivated and they were noted for their good crops and industrious- 
ness. â€¢ The three Lenape clans each claimed mystical descent from a totemic animal: 
these dans are the Wolf, the Turtle and the Turkey. 

CURRENT TRIBAL ROLL: 9,249 tribal members.

MIAMI 



TRIBAL NAME: The name Miami is from the Chippewa term Oumamlk, meaning "people 
who live on the peninsula." Early English writers referring to the Miami adapted the name 
Twightwees, which was taken from the tribal language and meant "the cry of the crane." 

LANGUAGE: Belonging to the Algonquian linguistic family. 

HISTORY: The Miami originally came from the region around Green Bay, Wisca'sK By 
1700, they had migrated to Indiana and Ohio, where they played a prominent part in the 
Ohio Valley Indian wars. Following the Treaty of Greenville in 1795, the Miami banded 
together with the Eel River Indians. â€¢ In 1840, unable to stem white encroachment, they 
soid their Indiana lands and accepted a 500,000-acre reservation In Kansas. Upon their 
arrival In Kansas though, disease, epidemics and white ancroachment served to help break 
up the tribe. By 1848, 300 tribal members had established a village on the east bank of the 
Marals des Cygnes River in present-day Miami County, Kansas. â€¢ In 1854, with the demand 
for opering the rich Miami reservation lands to white settlement, Kansas Territory saw a 
treaty concluded that provided for land allotments (200 acres each) to the Miami living on 
the re'iervation - a tract of 70,000 acres held in common by the tribe--and for the surplus 
lands to be sold to the United States. â€¢ By the terms of their last treaty in 1867, those 
Mtomi who wished to become citizens of Kansas were to remain there; the rest were to move 
to Indian Territory to be confederated with the Peoria, Kaskaskia, Wea and Piankashaw. 
Some dW confederate with the Peoria, but the majority chose not to and became known as 
the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma. 

CULTURE: The Miami were described in early times as swift runners fond of racing. 
French explorers once noted their polite manners, ready response and obedience to their 
chiefs. Unlike most tribes of the Great Lakes region, the Miami chose to travel by land rather 
than canoes. 

KEY POPULATION AREAS: Currently in Ottawa County; the town of Miami perpetuates the 
name of the tribe.

SENECA-CAYUGA 



TRIBE NAME: The name Seneca is from the Iroquoian term which means "people of the 
standing or projecting rock or stone" derived from Onenuiteron'no. 

LANGUAGE: Belonging to the Iroquoian linguistic family, the largest division of the Five 
Nations (or league of the Iroquois), who were first found living in New York. 

HISTORY: This was a well-known confederation of Iroquois Indian bands drawn from 
throughout the Northwest that Included the Mingo (from the upper Ohio River), Conestoga, 
Cayuga, Mohawk, Oneida, Tuscarora and Onondaga (driven into Ohio by Â©arty colonists) 
and the Seneca of Sandusky (who had lived in New York at the outset of the American 
Revolution). After the war, the Cayuga moved to Ohio, where they were granted a 
reservation along the Sandusky River. They were joined there by the Shawnee of Ohio and 
the rest of the confederacy. â€¢ In 1831, the tribe sold their land in Ohio and accepted a 
reservation in the Cherokee Nation in Indian Territory. They were a prosperous people who, 
preparing to leave Ohio, heavily loaded their baggage (clothing, household goods, tools, 
seed) onto a steamboat to sail to St. Louis. The trip to their new home took eight months 
plagued by delays, blizzards, floods, disease and death. Upon their arrival in Indian 
Territory, they found their lands overlapped those of the Cherokee. Another band (the Mixed 
Band of Seneca and Shawnee) also traded their Ohio lands for a tract in Indian Territory; 
theirs was wholly within the Cherokee Nation. An 1832 treaty - the first made by the U.S. 
with the Immigrant Indians within the boundaries of Oklahoma - adjusted the boundaries 
and created the "United Nations of Seneca and Shawnee." â€¢ During the Civil War, the tribe 
allied with the Confederacy. Because their homeland became a battleground, eventually 
most fled to Kansas for safety. !n 1867, federal negotiators sold part of their lands to various 
tribes and arranged for the separation of the Shawnee (who then became the Eastern 
Shawnee). â€¢ In 1881, a band of Cayuga from Canada joined the Seneca tribe In Indian 
Territory. In 1902, shortly before Oklahoma became a state, 372 members of the joint tribe 
received land allotments.

ABSENTEE SHAWNEE 



THIBE NAME: Shawnee is taken from the Algonquian word Shawunog, meaning 
"Southerners." The Absentee band is one of three who live in Oklahoma; each is often 
simply called Shawnee. 

LANGUAGE: B'pressive and eloquent, the Absentee Shawnee belong to the central 
Algonquian dialect group; the Southern advance guard of the Algonquian Stock. 

HISTORY: Lived along the Ohio River in prehistoric times, until wars with the Iroquois 
forced them to leave the region and migrate southeastward (thus their "Southern" name). 
The first English colonists found the Shawnee in South Carolina and Georgia, with a few 
bands scattered and settled in other Southern states, some as far south as the Gulf Coast. 
â€¢ By 1692, most Shawnee had moved to what !s now northeastern Pennsylvania; another 
group settled in Tennessee, then was driven to Kentucky. After 25 years, the two factions 
reunited, settling north of the Ohio River. â€¢ For 40 years, the Shawnee waged war with 
settlers-until 1795, when the Treaty of Greenville was signed. â€¢ As early as 1800, tfr? bands 
that would become the Absentee Shawnee began moving south and west. Some settled in 
Indian Territory (now McCurtain County); others went on to Texas and Louisiana. In 1839, 
some who settled in Texas were driven out and took refuge in the Cherokee Nation. During 
the 1859 mass Indian expulsion from Texas, another band was sent to Caddo County, then 
moved to the Seminole Nation and settled on adjacent Potawatomi lands. â€¢ In 1890, 
Shawnee tribal lands between the Seminole and Potawatomi were allotted to individual 
members and the remaining land opened to homesteaders by a land run in 1891. 

CULTURE: Many members still observe ancient tribal traditions - arts and crafts, religious 
rites, powwows and speaking the native language. Dances of thanksgiving (called Bread 
Dances) are heid each spring and fall.

EASTERN SHAWNEE 

TRIBE NAME: The name Shawnee Is from the Algonquian term shawun, which means 
"South," or shawnunogi, "Southerners." They call themselves Shawano. 

LANGUAGE: The Shawnee Indians are one of the most important tribes of the Algonquian 
linguistic family. 

HISTORY: This was a leading tribe with prehistoric settlements In the Ohio River region. 
Because of the interior position of their villages (away form traveled routes of early times) 
and their migratory habits, little is known of the Shawnee tribe's origins. Wars with the 
Iroquois forced them to migrate southeastward, taking them to South Carolina, Georgia and 
as far south as the Gulf Coast. â€¢ By 1692, most Shawnee had moved to what Is now 
northeastern Pennsylvania; another group settled in Tennessee and then was driven to 
Kentucky. After 25 years, the two factions reunited, settling north of the Ohio River. â€¢ The 
Shawnee of Ohio were openly hostile to the U.S. until the 1813 battlefield de^th of their great 
war chief Tecumseh seemed to break their fighting spirit, and they made peace with the U.S. 
â€¢ While some of the tribe left Ohio, splitting into bands and settling in Louisiana, Kansas, 
Texas and Indian Territory, the Shawnee which stayed behind in Ohio joined with the 
Seneca-Cayuga tribe in 1832. Known then as the Mixed Shawnee, they later were named 
the Eastern Shawnee. â€¢ in 1867, they accepted a reservation In the far northeastern part of 
IT.: Ottawa County. 

FAMOUS MEMBERS: Tecumseh, Chief Bluejacket and Tenskwatawa (The Prophet). 
CURRENT TRIBAL ROLL: 1,563 members. 

KEY POPULATION AREAS: Ottawa, Craig, Rogers and other northern Oklahoma counties.

LOYAL SHAWNEE TRIBE 

TRIBAL NAME: Shawnee Is taken from the Algonquian word Shawunog, meaning 
"Southerners." The Loyai band is one of three in Oklahoma; each is often simply called 
Shawnee. 

LANGUAGE: Belonging to the central Algonquian dialect group; the Southern advance 
guard of the Algonquian stock, the Shawnee are closely related to the Sac and Fox tribe. 

HISTORY: Traditional history and archaeological studies of the Shawnee point to their 
location along the Ohio River In prehistoric times. Wars with the Iroquois later forced them 
to leave this region and migrate southeastward (thus their "Southern" name). â€¢ The first 
English colonists found the Shawnee in South Carolina and Georgia, with a few bands 
scattered and settled In other Southern states, some as far south as the Gulf Coast. â€¢ By 
1692, the main part of the tribe in the valleys of the Delaware and the Susquehanna Rivers In 
northeastern Pennsylvania. Another large branch of the tribe settled in the valley of the 
Cumberland River In Tennessee, but these Shawnee were driven out in a war with the 
Cherokee and the Chickasaw about 1714 and migrated northward into Kentucky. Around 
1730, they began settling north of the Ohio River, where they were united about 25 years 
later with the main body of the tribe that moved westward from Pennsylvania. â€¢ in the mid- 
1700's, they waged war with settlers, until 1795, when the Treaty of Greenviiie was signed. 
As early as 1800, bands began moving south and west. In 1823, the Loyal Shawnee left 
Ohio and were forced to settle along the Missouri River in the area known today as Shawnee 
Mission, Kansas. â€¢ in 1869, another treaty was signed between the tribe and the United 
States government, anu again the Shawnee were forcibly removed, this time to Cherokee 
Indian Territory In what is now Craig County. Today, they reside In White Oak, Oklahoma. 

CULTURE: Many members still observe ancient tribal traditions - powwows, religious rites, 
arts and crafts and speaking the native language. Tribal dances of thanksgiving (called 
Bread Dances) are held annually in the spring and fall. 

KEY POPULATION AREAS: Craig, Rogers and other Northern Oklahoma counties.

INTRODUCTION - SECTION 1 
CHOCTAW 



In this unit, prepared by the Hartshorne Public 
Schools Team, the reader will get a glimpse of early 
history of the Choctaws. Some of the early day life 
styles mentioned will be the caring and naming of 
children, marriage, religion, and the use of 
medicine. Festivities of Choctaws Included the 
Alligator Dance, Snake Dance and many different 
types of ballgames. One will find the myths and 



legends section interesting where the "Creation" is 
discussed and can be compared to other tribes' 
stories of creation. 

The lesson plan overview will provide teachers 
with the grade level and subject matter, along with 
outstanding ideas for teachers to use in their own 
classrooms.

HISTORY 



The Choctaws were the largest tribe belonging 
to the southern branch of the Muskogean family 
which includes the Chickasaw, Creek and 
Seminole. Their name was said to come from a 
Spanish word chato, meaning fiat because of the 
Choctaw custom of flattening infants' skulls with 
sandbags. 

The Choctaw, as members of the Five Tribes, 
furnished the name for counties and towns in 
Alabama, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Arkansas. 
Choctaws were second only in population to the 
Cherokees. Historians have always referred to the 
Choctaws as one of the most advanced, peaceful 
and practical of the tribes. 

Originally, the Choctaws occupied centrai and 
southern Mississippi and western Alabama. 
Although the Choctaws had hundreds of towns, 
there were two principal towns, one located south 
of New Orleans and the other, between the 
Chickasaw settlement and present-day Mobile. (It 
should be noted that various towns were important 
depending on existing conditions). The Choctaw, 
along with other tribes, watched the arrival of the 
white man near today's Tampa Bay in the year 
1530. Europeans had visited before on a 
touch-and-go basis, but not until the year 1539 did 
they enter the heartland of the region led by 
Hernando DeSoto. 

DeSoto led his well-equipped army to shore at 
Tampa Bay, Florida, in search of goid and silver. 
His troops marched and fought from the Florida 
Peninsula through what is now Georgia, Tennessee, 
Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas and Louisiana, 
where he died. A century later, the Europeans 
began moving in from aii directions. 

The Choctaw's first encounter with civilization 
was not a happy one. When DeSoto demanded 
that Chief Tuscaloosa provide the services of the 
tribesmen, the chief appeared agreeable, but 
suggested that the Spanish go with him to the 
principal town to get the Choctaws to carry their 
baggage. Tuscaloosa then sent messengers to the 
town warning warriors of impending battle. 

DeSoto was surprised when he reached 
Mobile to find warriors waiting and to find them 
such strong adversaries. The Spaniards were 
driven out of town and scattered. Wearing armor 
and firearms astride horses, DeSoto's men rallied 
and overcame the Choctaws though he lost 22 men 
and his supplies. The Choctaws, according to 
Spanish reports, lost several hundred warriors. 
DeSoto set fire to the town, and those Choctaws 



inside their houses were burned alive. 

For the next 160 years, Choctaws were 
undisturbed by Europeans. In 1698, the French 
came from Canada and established settlements. 
Their principal method of livelihood was trapping for 
animal furs, trading with the Indians, and sending 
their bounty to the rich European markets. 

During this peaceful time, the Choctaws were 
contacted by English traders and peaceful trade 
was established. As they traded and intermarried, 
the French and English introduced the Choctaws to 
materials and customs which they found useful. 
With the coming of the English, however, Choctaw 
land became the site of the French and Indian War, 
a power struggle among France, England, Spain 
and eventually the United States. 

England and France each tried to make an 
alliance with the Choctaws. Pulled two ways, the 
Choctaws were drawn into a struggle resulting in 
tribal civil war. By 1750, the French defeated the 
English faction leaving the Choctaws allied with the 
French. The final struggle for supremacy between 
England and France ended in 1760 with the French 
defeated. The French gave up claims to land west 
of the Mississippi including the Choctaw Nation. 
Less than 20 years later, the colonies won their 
independence from England, and the Choctaws 
came under the jurisdiction of the United States. 

Being under the jurisdiction of the United 
States spelled further trouble for the Choctaws. 
The tribe had about 40,000 square miles of land 
with only some 20,000 Indians living on it. Because 
the Choctaws lacked equipment to be large farmers 
or stockraisers, they were using only a small 
portion of their tribal lands with the remainder set 
aside for hunting grounds. So, at the insistence of 
white settlers between 1801-1820, the United States 
government negotiated treaties with the Choctaws 
which took more than half of their original land 
holdings. In the 1820 Treaty of Doaks Stand, the 
Choctaws ceded 4,150,000 acres of their tribal 
lands to the United States; the Choctaws retained 
title to 10,421,129 acres. 

When Mississippi entered the Union in 1817, 
pressure began to mount for the Choctaws to give 
up all their lands and move to a territory west of the 
Mississippi. This territory was to be a sovereign 
nation for the Indians and off limits to non-Indians. 

The Choctaws were given two choices: take 
an individual land allotment and become a citizen 
of Mississippi or go to their new land and set up 
their own government.

Many Indian groups, especially the full-bloods, 
believed that their property in southeastern United 
States, was a gift of the Great Spirit so, it was 
impossible for the Indian to leave it. 

The term "Trail of Tears" can be applied to all 
the Tive Tribes" not just the Choctaws. The tears 
started when the mixed-bloods signed cession 
treaties accepted by the United States government 
as the will of the Indian nations. Each tribe made 
its own treaty which produced intra-tribal and inter- 
tribal conflicts. The xreaty of the Choctaws was 
called the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek 
(September 20, 1830). Choctaw removal to Indian 
Territory beg^n in the fall of 1830. With this treaty 
the Choctaws were given title to what is now the 
southeastern counties of Oklahoma in return for 
their 10 million acres in Mississippi. 

All these factor*, paved the way for the 
Choctaw's ultimate removal from Mississippi, the 
first tribe to make the Trail of Tears." 

The United States government decided to 
remove the Indians by steamboat. The northern 
Choctaws moved by wagons to Memphis, 
Tennessee, then traveled by steamboats down the 
Mississippi River to the mouth of the Arkansas River 
then to Fort Smith, Arkansas. 

The southern Choctaws were gathered and 
transported to Vicksburg, Mississippi, where they 
traveled up the Red and Ouachita (then called the 
Little Arkansas) Rivers to about where Camden, 
Arkansas, is now located. Then they were hauled 
by wagons to Indian Territory. 

The first steamboats were to leave Memphis 
and Vicksburg in November of 1831. The delivery 
of the Choctaws to Memphis and Vicksburg was 
slowed down tremendously when an outbreak of 
cholera was reported. The wagoneers hired to 
transport the Indians were scared by the outbreak 
of cholera and quit in mid-journey. The Choctaws 
had to drive themselves. Before the Choctaws 
arrived in Memphis and Vicksburg, the United 
States government canceled the order tor 
steamboats because it would be cheaper to 
transport the Indians all the way by wagons. 

By November 1831, a large group of the 
Choctaws were gathered on the west side of the 
Mississippi River across from Memphis and 
Vicksburg. Heavy rains caused the heavily loaded, 
army wagons to sink down to their floorboards in 
the mud. This moving problem caused the United 
States government, under pressure from the 
residents of Vicksburg and Memphis, to provide 
steamboats for the Indians. 

The government agents announced that any 



Choctaw willing to walk to the new lands would be 
furnished guides, food and $10. About 300 
Choctaws agreed to the plan and were dispatched 
from Vicksburg under the direction of a team of 
four guides. 

In mid-November, four draft boats - Reindeer, 
Walter Scott, Talma and Cleopatra - began 
transporting the Choctaws to the Indian Territory. 
Reindeer and Walter Scoti proceeded down the 
Mississippi to the mouth of the Arkansas River and 
then started up the river toward Fort Smith. Sixty 
miles up the Arkansas River from the Mississippi 
River, the two steamers were halted, and the 
Indians were pulled off the boat to make room for 
a contingent of soldiers. 

On that day, one of the worst blizzards in 
history struck, plunging temperatures to below 
freezing and coating the landscape with sleet and 
ice. There were only 60 small army tents to house 
the 2,000 Choctaw men, women and children, most 
of whom had only the clothing they were wearing 
and no food. Many of the Choctaws died during 
the eight days of waiting for the government to 
send 40 wagons and food. After arrival, the 
wagons carried the sick while the others walked on 
to Little Rock, then westward to Skullyviile on the 
Canadian River. 

The Choctaws on the Talma and Cleopatra 
steamboats had gone up the Little Arkansas River 
(also known as Ouachita) as far as Monroe, 
Louisiana. They were held up at Monroe because 
the guides and the 300 Choctaws who had chosen 
to walk were lost in the swamps of northeastern 
Louisiana. While the Choctaws aboard the Talma 
and the Cleopatra waited at Monroe, a rescue party 
brought the 300 lost Indians to the river post. 

After developing problems, the Talma turned 
back to Vicksburg, leaving only the Cleopatra to 
transport 1,300 Choctaws up the river. After 
making several trips, the Cleopatra landed the 
Indians at a place near the present location of 
Camden, Arkansas. 

From Camden, the Indians were forced to 
walk overland to their new land. Despite all of their 
many problems and hardships, this group arrived at 
a location just northeast of the present city of 
Horatio, Arkansas, in early January 1832. However, 
at this point, they were forced by government 
agencies to make camp until federal agents 
checked the Indians into their new lands. So the 
Choctaws camped at Camden from January until 
late March because the federal agents took so 
long. 

During this three-month period, food supplies 



100 



112 



were extremely short. As a result, the Choctaws 
suffered from hunger, dysentery, pneumonia, 
Influenza and malnutrition. 

In late March, a temporary post was set up at 
"Eagle" (now Eagletown on the Mountain Fork 
River). The Choctaws were allowed to spread out 
Into the tribe's new land. About 200 had died, so 
1,100 checked in at Eagle. 

The second phase of the migration was only 
slightly better handled by the United States 
government. The elements again interfered with the 
Removal. 

The Choctaws thai were loaded at Memphis 
had reached Arkansas Post. They were told that the 
steamboats could not go on because of flood 
conditions. The 3,000 Choctaws were forced to 
walk from Arkansas Post to Little Rock. At one 
point, the flooding was so bad the Indians had to 
walk more than 30 miles through flood waters 
ranging from knee deep to waist deep. 

When the group struggled into Little Rock, an 
army captain was so disturbed by their treatment 
that he commandeered enough army wagons to 
transport the Choctaws to Skullyville. 

The southern route went smoother, partially 
because some of the richer Choctaws (the Joneses, 
Doaks, Pitchiynns, Harrises) had purchased 
wagons. The Choctaws already in Indian Territory 
brought wagons to the Camden landing when the 
steamers arrived with the incoming Choctaws. 

The first groups of the 17,000 Choctaws were 
all In their new land by early 1834. In 1836, another 
4,000 of the 12,000 Choctaws in Mississippi found 
the white man's law too oppressive and joined their 
brothers in the west. So ended the Choctaw 'Trail 
of Tears." 

Disaster and death for the old, the sick and 
the Infants marked all removal trails. Corruption 
and inefficiency in the U.S. War Department toward 
providing transportation, food and supplies made 
the problems worse. Spoiled meat and grain 
caused dysentery; cholera outbreaks weakened 
and killed Indians. The blizzard of 1831-1832 
reduced the number of Choctaw immigrants 
reaching Indian Territory. 

Sick, hungry and bitter, the Indians slowly 
arrived in eastern Oklahoma. Old and new 
problems added to the difficulties of adjustment. 
Internal differences had to be faced. The uniting of 
different tribes in one geographical area 
complicated adjustment. The Chickasaws and the 
Choctaws merged (1837-1855). The Creeks and 
Seminoles meshed in 1833-1856. Yet many tribes 
did not want to exist under another tribe's 



government. The problems were settled when the 
tribes were allowed to separate into five separate 
Indian land areas. 

After writing its first constitution in 1826 before 
the Removal, the Choctaws made many changes in 
its basic law between 1834 and 1860 following 
Removal. A second constitution written at 
Skullyville in 1857 abolished the office of district 
chief and established a national governor. These 
agreements were opposed by a group which wrote 
a new constitution at Doaksville and set up a rival 
government. The compromise constitution of 1860 
made use of the older constitution's organization 
with district chiefs and courts, but included from the 
new constitution a new national government with a 
two-house general council, a principal chief, and a 
supreme court. 

As in the other governments of the "Five 
Tribes," the Choctaws basic law was democratic, 
with wide suffrage and lenient eligibility for holding 
office. The constitution provided sharp separation 
of legislature, executive and judicial functions. The 
Bill of Rights included guarantees of trial by jury, 
religious liberty and freedom of assembly. 

The Choctaws in eastern Oklahoma were 
divided into the same districts they had in 
Mississippi. Each was governed by a chief elected 
every four years by the citizens of the district. The 
three chiefs met annually with members of the 
General Council (the legislative body) to make the 
laws and examine their relations with the United 
States. From 1837 to 1855, the Chickasaws 
merged and became a fourth district. 

After 1855, the area in the fourth district 
became the independent Chickasaw Nation. 

Under the constitution, the Principal Chief was 
elected by the people for a two-year term. A 
constitutional provision disqualified him from 
serving more than two successive terms. The 
candidate for chief had to be a free, male citizen; 
30 years-old; a lineal descendant of the Choctaw or 
Chickasaw race; and a resident of the nation for at 
least five years preceding his election. He had the 
power to enforce the laws, command the militia, 
convene special sessions of the General Council 
and fill all vacancies in elective offices by temporary 
appointments that remained In force until the next 
general election, in the event of his death, he was 
succeeded by the president of the senate, who 
handled the chiefs function when the chief was 
absent or temporarily Incapacitated. 

According to custom, the Council entrusted 
the chief with immense discretionary power In the 
administration of the contingent fund, appointments 

113 



101 



often subject to the approval of the senate, 
representing the nation in lawsuits and in relations 
with the United States. Through his messages to 
the Council, he also exerted great power over 
lawmaking. Originally, he was paid an annual 
salary of $1 ,000. That increased in 1883 to $2,000. 

After the Principal chief had served his 
constitutional limit of two terms in succession, he 
was commonly elected to the council where the 
prestige and experience he had acquired as chief 
made him a leading member. He usually sought 
election as Principal chief for a third term as soon 
as the constitutional disability had expired. 

The other executive officials of the Choctaw 
Nation - the Principal chiefs "cabinet" - were the 
national secretary, treasurer, auditor and attorney. 
The Principal Chief was often referred to as the 
governor. Strictly speaking, these national officers 
did not constitute a cabinet, for they were elected 
by the people for two-year terms on the years 
between the chieftain elections. The national 
officers were subject to removal by the council, and 
the chiefs power of appointment for vacancies 
occurring in elective offices put them somewhat 
under his control. 

The national secretary was entrusted with the 
seal and the tribe's public documents. The national 
treasurer had control of the disbursement of funds. 
The national attorney was expected to give legal 



advice to the Principal chief and other officers of 
the government. The national auditor was originally 
intended to head the financial administration, and to 
present financial plans and advice to the General 
Council. The importance of the auditor's office 
declined until he became little more than an 
accountant. 

After Removal, the first meeting of the 
Choctaw Tribal counci; was held near Tuskahoma 
where a commodious log council house was 
erected in 1839. The first capttot of the Choctaw 
Nation was named Nanih Waiya in memory of a 
sacred mound back in Mississippi. 

In 1833, the General Council made an 
appropriation for the erection of a substantial brick 
building, the Tuskahoma Capitol House located 
about two miles northeast of the site of the oid . 
Nanih Waiya Council House. The Choctaw Council 
House, and the 2,700 acres surrounding it, is the 
only Indian Council House still under the ownership 
of an Indian tribe. 

Since 1884, the old Choctaw Council House 
near Tuskahoma has been the scene of many 
events knit into the very fibers of the Choctaw 
people. The last Council House near Tuskahoma 
is a symbol of their pride, their love for educating 
their children and desire for following an organized 
government for the general welfare of their nation. 




EARLY DAY LIFE-STYLES 



Children: The children grew up in unrestrained 
freedom. Discipline was administered by the 
mothers to the girls, and the maternal uncle had 
control of the boys. Neither boys nor girls were 
allowed to carry burdens but were encouraged to 
run and play to make them agile. The boys 
roamed through the woods, shooting bows and 
arrows at birds and small animals. They wrestled 
and participated in feats of skill. 

Birth: The Choctaws lived in a matriarchal society. 
The father had no control over his own children, 
who were under the supervision of their oldest 
maternal uncle. Chieftainship passed from uncle to 
nephew rather than from father to son. 

When a girl was with child, during the last 
days before the baby was born, and for eight days 
thereafter if the baby was a girl, the man was to eat 
nothing but the evening meal. 

Adoption was common and indicated by the 
simple process of allowing the adopted child to eat 
from the family bowl. 

Naming: Choctaw children received their name 
from something connected with their early life or 
from animals. Later, the boys received a new name 
as a recognition for some special achievement or 
personal characteristic. 

The Choctaws were reluctant to pronounce 
their own names. The wife was forbidden to speak 
the name of her husband; she referred to him by 
the n-r.e of her child, "Running Wolfs father." 

Marriage: When a Choctaw man decided to marry 
a certain girl, he confided in his mother or if she 
was not living, his nearest female relative. She in 
turn talked with the girl's mother or her nearest 
living female relative. If the two women agreed, 
they visited the chiefs or heads of the two "og/a," or 
families, to get their consent for the union. As a 
man was not allowed to marry a girl who belonged 
to his og/a, often the women were obliged to make 
a long journey before seeing the two chiefs, whose 
villages were frequently a considerable distance 
apart. 

After all necessary arrangements had been 
made a day was fixed for the marriage. 

Religion: The religious traditions of the tribe were 
centered around the huge fortified mound of Nanih 
Waya, or "sloping hill." It was located on the 
northern frontier of the Choctaw settlement in the 



present county of Winston, Mississippi. It was 
probably designed to protect them against the 
Chickasaws. 

The earliest description declared it to be a 
mound 40 to 50 feet high, and covered (at the 
base) about an acre. It was protected by a circular 
wall, 10 feet in height, and 30 to 40 feet in width, 
enclosing an area of about one square mile. Inside 
this enclosure, a lower mound was used as a burial 
place. 

The fundamental belief in immortality was 
obvious in the burial customs, the most curious and 
the most distinctive of all Choctaw ceremonies. 

When a member of the tribe died, the body 
was covered with skins and bark and placed on an 
elevated platform which was erected near his house 
for that purpose. Even if the death occurred far 
from home, the body was carefully brought back 
and placed near the house. 

Beside the corpse were placed food and drink, 
a change of clothing, and favorite utensils and 
ornaments which would be needed by the spirit in 
its long journey to the other world. A dog was 
killed to provide the deceased with a companion, 
and after the introduction of horses, ponies were 
also sacrificed so that the spirit might ride. For the 
first few days, a fire was kept constantly burning to 
. furnish light and warmth for the journey. 

The body remained upon the scaffold for a 
fixed period which varied from one month to six 
months according to local customs. The period of 
mourning depended upon the age of the deceased. 
For a child or young person, it was about three 
months, but for an older person, such as, one's 
mother or father, mourning lasted from six months 
to a year. During this time, the relatives returned to 
the foot of the platform to wail and mourn. In warm 
weather, the stench from the decomposing body 
became so intolerable that the women sometimes 
fainted while performing the ceremony. 

When the body had remained upon the 
scaffold for the specified time, a bone picker was 
summoned, and all the relatives and frierwds were 
invited for the last rites. These undertakers were 
tattooed in a distinctive manner and allowed their 
fingernails to grow long to aid them in their work. 

The mourners surrounded the scaffold wailing 
and weeping while the undertaker ascended the 
platform. With his long fingernails, he thoroughly 
cleaned the bones of the putrefied flesh. The bones 
were then passed down to the waiting relatives. 
The skull was painted with vermilion, and the

articles were carefully placed in a coffin constructed 
of bark and cane. The flesh was left on the 
scaffolding. 

With much ceremonial wailing, the hamper of 
bones was borne to the village bone house, a 
structure built on poles and surrounded by a 
palisade. There it was placed in a row with other 
coffins. The mourners returned to the house, 
where all participated in a feast presided over by 
the bone-picker. 

During the next three-day ceremony, the 
mourners cried or wailed three times a day: at 
sunrise, noon and sunset. While wailing, they 
wrapped blankets around their heads and sat or 
knelt upon the ground. During these three days, 
the friends of the mourners gathered and began 
dancing and feasting. At the expiration of the time, 
they ceased weeping and joined in the festivities 
which continued another day. 

Once or twice a year, a mourning ceremony 
Involving the entire settlement was held. The 
hampers of bones were all removed at this time, 
then returned at the close of the ceremony. When 
the charnel house became full, the bones were 
buried. Sometimes the earth was placed over it to 
form a mound, and sometimes the bones of several 
villages were placed in one heap and covered with 
soil. 

Medicine: The Choctaws learned from trial and 
error which plants were helpful for curing illnesses 
and which plants the sick animals were eating. 
Remedies that worked were handed down to the 
next generation. Usually, one person knew more 
remedies than anyone else. The Choctaws would 
come to him for help, and he was thus given the 
title "Indian Doctor." 

There were Medicine Men who served as 
official priests In the Choctaw Nation. Treating 
disease, supplying charms to the lovelorn and 
causing harm to enemies were part of the priests 
duties. 

The belief in witches and evil spirits protected 
the Medicine Man from the possible consequences 
of his failures and provided a reason for tragedy. 
Choctaw Medicine Men were allowed to put an 
incurably ill person out of his misery by 
strangulation. 

Upon the death of a patient, the witch who 
caused the misery and death was named by the 
Medicine Man. Usually, the chosen victim was an 
older woman who lived alone and/or had few 
relatives or little position in the tribe. The relatives 
of the dead took revenge by shooting the 



proclaimed witch. Witchcraft was practiced by both 
men and women. It was never definitely known 
whether a person possessed the power to bewitch 
or when he was making use of it. 

Individuals practicing witchcraft, according to 
Choctaw beliefs, could eliminate internal organs at 
night thus reducing their weight to so great an 
extent that they could fly at night to harm Indians 
they did not like. Several spirits no larger than a 
man's thumb accompanied the witch to the 
individual's house. The witch would point toward 
the person indicating to the little spirits that they 
could touch the person and then do mischief about 
the place. The witch was able to pass through 
cracks and could easily reach places not accessible 
to a larger being. After directing the little spirits to 
remain behind and continue their work, the wizard 
would fly back to his village and again assume his 
original form. 

When the Choctaw was wounded by a bullet 
or arrow, the medicine man first sucked the wound, 
then spat out the blood. He used root powder to 
dry and heal the wound and to prevent infection. 
No lint or compress was used in dressing the 
wound. 

For toothaches, the Choctaws chewed the 
bark of the buttonbush. Bark of the prickly ash was 
placed in a cavity to stop the pain of a toothache. 

Choctaws made use of steam cabinets into 
which were boiled all sorts of sweet-smelling herbs. 
Vapor filled with essence and salt of these herbs 
entered the patients body through pores and 
through his nose. Strength was thus restored. This 
cured many malfunctions including the effects of 
overeating. 

The flowering ash or "private tree* had bark 
with antiseptic quality. The bark was boiled in 
water and the extract was used to bathe wounds. 

Miscellaneous remedies were numerous, 
fviullein leaves were also used as a poultice for 
headaches. Pine pitch was mixed with grease and 
taliowto make a salve for treating wounds resulting 
from splinters and thorns. The inside bark of pine 
saplings made an effective medicine for diarrhea. 
Rabbit tobacco (called life everlasting by the 
whites) was made into an infusion and was drunk 
in cases of fever. It was also used as a tobacco 
substitute. 

Jerusalem oak, or wormwood, was made into 
a kind of candy and fed to children to get rid of 
worms. Pink root was added to whiskey and used 
to "build up the system." it was weakened and 
sugar was added when it was given to children. 

Equal parts of honey, butter, and juice of the 



104 

116 



green vines and leaves of the pole bean were 
steamed together very slowly until the mixture 
formed a soft salve. The salve was used to cure 
skin cancer. Persons using the cancer cure were 
to refrain from use of alcoholic beverages and 
fats. 

Food and Cooking: At the time the Spanish 
encountered the Choctaws, these Indians were an 
agricultural people who cultivated corn, beans, 
squash, melons, and pumpkins. They raised 
enough corn to trade with surrounding tribes. 
Baskets of cane or reeds and a crude form of 
pottery typified the Choctaws at this point. They 
killed game with weapons made of stone, bone, 
or wood, such as, the primary weapons of spears 
and bows and arrows. 

The Choctaws prepared a favorite dish, 
Tash-labona t by soaking corn for a short time or 
until the hull had slipped off, leaving the grain of 
corn as whole as possible. Then they took the 
corn out and fanned it in a basket (ufko) to 
separate the hulls from the grain of corn. This 
basket or ufko was made of stripped cane, it was 
about three feet long and 18 inches wide. One 
half of this basket was fiat, having no sides, but 
started from the center of the length. The sides 
gradually rose from a fraction of an inch to five 
inches, one end being five inches in height. The 
corn was fanned and the grains all went to the 
end with the sides while the hulls were blown off 
the flat end. After the hulls were all disposed of, 
the corn was put in a kettle with lots of water. 
Pieces of fresh pork were salted until it was thick. 

With Ta-fula, the same process was followed 
as with Tash-labona, only the corn was beaten 
until the grains of corn were broken into three or 
four pieces. The hulls were then separated from 
the grains, followed by cooking with beans, wood 
ashes or in any other way. Meat was not cooked 
with Ta-Fula. The women used plenty of water 
and boiled it down until there was a lot of juice. 

Clothing: Men wore a yard-long buckskin 
breechcioth while women wrapped themselves in 
a skirt of similar material. Both wore moccasins 
and leggins. In winter, they wore robes of fur, 
feathers or bark. Ornaments were beads of nuts, 
seeds, bones, shells, and colored stones. 

Men wore their hair long enough to enable 
them to make two braids, one on each side of the 
head. In front, the hair was cut straight across 
above the eyebrow. Women allowed their hair to 
grow very long. Feathers were also used in their 



hair; the kind and size of the feather denoted rank 
or status of the person wearing it. 

Both men and women painted their faces, 
especially when dressed for dancing. Blue, red, 
yellow, and green were the colors primarily used. 
There were no special designs, and no combina- 
tion of i !ors had any specific meaning. One of 
the favorite patterns was a yellow crescent 
outlined in blue which was painted on both 
cheeks. This design was painted on both men 
and women and represented a new moon in the 
dark blue sky. Tattooing was practiced by both 
men and women but only to a very limited extent. 
Sometimes shoulders and faces were tattooed, 
but no other part of the body was ever marked. 

The Choctaw method of tattooing was most 
interesting. A needle was used to puncture the 
skin, and soot from a yellow-pine fire was rubbed 
over the surface. This soot was then wiped off 
and more soot was rubbed in to make certain that 
the punctures were filled. The soot gave a bluish 
tinge to the dots, and no other substance or color 
was ever employed. 

Homes: Their early houses were much like the 
log cabin of the white pioneers. To construct 
them, they placed poles upright in the ground 
about 18 inches apart. They used strong vines to 
weave between the poles and join them together. 
Clay was mixed and daubed into the vine network 
to provide protection from the weather. Roofs 
were sloping and covered with bark, and a hole 
was left in each gable end to let out smoke from 
the fireplace where cooking was done. 

Schools: From 1841-43, the General Council 
provided funds for the building and maintenance 
of three academies for boys and five for girls. 
The boarding schools were placed under the 
supervision of different mission boards 
Presbyterian, Methodists, and Baptist - which 
furnished the teachers and paid part of the 
expenses of the schools. 

The boys were taught manual labor and 
farming. The girls were taught housekeeping, 
laundering, and sewing. 

Arts and Crafts: The only colors used by 
Choctaws in making baskets were yellow, red and 
black. These, together with the natural cane, 
gave them four colors to combine in their work. 
They made their dye from roots and bark. The 
Choctaw people used a white clay for their 
pottery that was found under a superstratum of 



M 7 



yellow clay and sand along the river banks. No 
sand or pulverized shell was used. 

The clay was moistened and kneaded until 
the mass was uniformly damp. The object was 
then molded and allowed to dry. The decoration 
was added; the object was then burned in a bed 
of hot ashes and glowing coals. When thoroughly 
burned, it turned rather dark in color. When it 
was removed from the fire, the pot was 
immediately immersed in a bowl of grease which 
was absorbed by the clay. This caused the day 
to turn dark and shiny. The day was fashioned 
into clay pipes and pottery bowls. 

The Choctaw believed that no person, 
except the one making the object, should see it 
until It was removed from the fire, if another 
person chanced to look on an object while it was 
being made or before it was burned, the tribe 
believed it would crack as soon as it was placed 
near the fire. 

The Chociaws had several uses for leather, 
and preparing the skins was a lengthy process, 
if a skin was to be tanned soft without hair, a hole 
was dug in the ground. The size of the hole was 
determined by the number of skins ;o be tanned. 
The walls and bottom of the ho^ were made 
smooth and water was poured in The skins were 
put into the water and left overnight. After the 
skin had become sufficiently softened, it was 
taken from the water and spread over a beam. 
Then the hair was removed by a drawknife. 
(Stone or bone were formerly used as a knife.) 

After the hair was removed, the skin was 
placed in a mortar (a hole in a log). Eggs and 
cornmeal mixed with water were poured over the 
skin, and the skin was then thoroughly beaten 
with a wooden pestle. The skin was wrung dry, 
and several holes were cut around the edge. 
Cords were tied through these holes, and the skin 
was stretched between two posts. The skin was 
scraped again until all particles of flesh were 
remo/ed; then it was left to dry. To soften the 
skin, it was pulled back and forth over a rounded 
stake in the ground. This process of tanning left 
the skin soft and white. 

If the hair was to be left on the skin, the skin 
was first softened with clear water. It was then 
spread over a beam and scraped to remove ail 
flesh. The inside was thoroughly rubbed with 
eggs, cornmeal, and water, being careful not to 
wet the fur. When it was dry, it was pulled back 
and forth over a stake so that it remained soft. 
The leather was then cut into straps for carrying 
baskets or narrow strips for the ball clubs and 



drum heads. The skins were taken from deer, 
cow, sheep, raccoon, and goat. 

Of necessity, Indians used materials that 
were readily available to them for their crafts. 
One of these materials was wood. In food 
preparation, a wooden mortar and pestie were 
used to crush sassafras leaves for soup, crush 
corn into meal or pound grains of rice to remove 
the chaff. 

Wood was also made into handles for the 
bone, stone, or metal scrapers used In tanning 
the leather. 

The only musical instrument known to the 
Choctaw was the drum, it was made from black 
gum tree and was 30 inches high and 15 inches 
in diameter and was less than two inches thick. 
The drum head consisted of untanned goat skin 
stretched over the open end while it was wet and 
pliable. Then it was passed around a loop one- 
haif inch thick. Another loop was passed over the 
first. 

The dugout, a form of boat transportation, 
was also made of wood. A large tree was chosen 
which would make a good boat. 

The primitive blowgun was used in hunting 
squirrels, rabbits, and various birds. It was about 
seven feet long and was made from a single 
piece of cane formed into a tube by perforation of 
the joints. The tube would then have a smooth 
bore of uniform diameter throughout. The darts 
were made either of small slender canes or pieces 
of hard, yellow pine sharpened at one end. The 
lower end was wrapped with a narrow band of 
cloth with a frayed edge. This expanded and 
filled the bore of the gun much better than 
feathers. Since this was a very tedious craft, very 
few Indians make blowguns now. The sticks were 
termed as a pair, and when one was broken, it 
was never replaced by an odd stick. 

Festivities: The Choctaws had favorite games 
and dances used frequently during ceremonies. 
Dances of the Choctaws imitated the eagle, deer, 
buffalo, alligator, bison, bear, turkey and snakes. 
Masks were worn representing the animal being 
portrayed. 

in the Alligator Dance, some of the Choctaw 
took the head of the alligator, others represented 
things that alligator might eat, and the grotesque 
antics of the animal were the dance. 

The Dance of the Young People is now 
obsolete. However, the Small Corn Dance and 
War Dance are still performed. 

The dances started in the afternoon. The 



106 



118 



performers dressed In their best regalia. They 
used about 40 metal bells as big as fish for a belt. 
Besides the big bells, they wore smaller bells all 
over themselves. They enjoyed the loud noise 
and some even carried rattles, pistols or a war 
club. 

The drummer stretched a deer skin over an 
earthen pot or kettle and beat it with one stick 
while the performers danced around him. The 
Choctaw songs had only five or six words, which 
were repeated over and over. They danced until 
they fell asleep. 

Among the most popular Choctaw dances 
were the Tick Dance, the Takeaway Dance, the 
Drum Dance and the Snake Dance. The Tick 
Dance was a slow dance dedicated to the 
detested, lowly parasite. The Takeaway Dance 
portrayed partners being split when a bey takes 
the girl dancing with another boy. In the highly 
symbolic Corn Dance, girls formed one line and 
boys, another. Traditionally, the dance culmin- 
ated in the serving of a dish calied Pashofa to the 
dancers. The dish was composed of cracked 
corn and pork cooked together in an iron pot 
over an open fire for many hours. 

The Duck Dance honored the bird that 
contributed much to the everyday living of the 
Indian. The fast Drum Dance began with a single 
line. Partners were then formed from within the 
group. A winding line of dancers in the Snake 
Dance honored the reptile as a friend of the 
Indian. 

The Tick Dance was begun by the dancers 
locking arms and forming straight lines. First they 
moved forward two or three steps, then 
backward, but they gradually advanced. When 
they took the forward step they stamped with the 
right foot as if crushing ticks on the ground. At 
the same time, they looked down, supposedly at 
the doomed Insects. 

In the Dance Go-and-Come, everyone 
locked arms, and the line moved sideways, first in 
one direction, then in the opposite but never 
backward or forward. If there were too many 
dancers for a single Sine, additional lines were 
formed. Everyone in the group sang the song for 
this particular dance. 

The Snake Dance was quite popular among 
the Choctaw. The dancers formed a single line, 
either grasping hands or holding on the shoulder 
of the dancer immediately in front. First came the 
men, then the women, and lastly the boys and 
girls. The first man In the line was naturally the 
leader; he moved along in a serpentine course, all 



dancers followed closely behind. Gradually, he 
led the dancers around and around until finally 
the line becanr.d coiled, resembling a snake. 
Soon the coil became so close it was impossible 
to move. The participants then released their 
hold on one another and ceased dancing. 

Games consisted of athletic contests of skill, 
such as wrestling, bow and arrow shoots, and the 
Choctaw ball game, a favorite sport often played 
by teams representing the towns or districts. This 
game could be called the national sport of the 
Choctaws, and it is still sometimes played by 
groups at a ceremonial or festivals. 

One of the oldest Choctaw games is 
Nakelomi. The 12 players knelt or sat on the 
ground in two rows, or "sides", facing each other 
with six players in each row. Seven hats were 
placed on the ground in a line between the two 
rows of players. The player who started the game 
was always at one end of his row. He held a 
small stone or shot in one hand, and with his 
other hand, he lifted the hats in order, placing the 
small stone or shot under which hat it laid. 
During the entire performance, he sang a 
particular song. After the stone or shot had been 
placed, the player opposite him guessed under 
which hat it laid. If he did not succeed in three 
guesses, the leader removed the object and again 
hid under the same or another hat. Then the 
second player on the opposite side had three 
guesses. If a player guessed under which hat the 
object was hidden, he in turn became the leader. 

Tolik, another popular game, used two 
stakes, each about 10 feet high and only a few 
inches in diameter, and a ball. The players were 
divided Into two equal groups or sides, which 
were designated as "A" and "B." The two stakes 
served as goals which were placed about 200 feet 
apart. One third of "A" players were on the "B" 
side of the field, and one third of the H B" players 
were near their opponent's goal. One player 
belonging to each side remained in the middle of 
the field. The ball was put in play by being 
thrown or held while the player endeavored to 
reach his opponent's goal. To score a point, a 
player was required to touch the goal post with 
the ball, or if the ball was thrown and hit the post, 
the play likewise counted. The first side to score 
a chosen number of points won the game. 

Of all of their community activities, the 
Choctaw entered the most enthusiastically into 
their native ball game, or Ishtaboli. The ball was 
made of deer skin and was handled by means of 
tivo kapucka, or hickory sticks about three feet 



long. One end of the stick was trimmed fiat and 
bent back into a oblong loop across which a web 
of raccoon skin thongs was iaced to form a sort 
of cup. 

Two goals were erected at a distance of 
about 200 or 300 yards from each other. Each 
pole consisted of two halves of a split log planted 
in the ground about six feet apart. The split side 
faced the playing field, and it was held in position 
by a traverse pole. 

The players scored points by scooping up 
the ball with kapucka, and tossing it against their 
own goal post. The score required to win was 
sometimes fixed as high as 100 points. Games 
were matched against neighboring settlements or 
even neighboring tribes. Two men were 
sometimes selected as champions and given the 
privilege of choosing the players alternately 
throughout the tribe. Almost any number of 
players could participate, and almost any means 
of stopping an opponent was legitimate. 

The women took care of the bets on the 
Ishtaboll and they encouraged their men by 
dancing. The night before the game was played, 
the Ball Play Dance was performed. The 
medicine men of the opposing sides pitted their 
magic charms against each other. This went on 
all night. Serious Injury and death sometimes 
resulted from this game. 

The women participated in a similar game 
played with a larger ball which was caught and 
carried with the hand. 

Another game, Ulth Chuppih or Alhchahpi, 
was played regularly. Each opponent was 
provided with a pole. A small rounded stone was 
rolled down a clay alley. One opponent tried to 
strike the rolling stone of the other opponent, 
while the other tried to hit the opponents in an 
effort to protect his stone. 

Any number of players could play the Corn 
Game at the same time, but usually there were 
only two. Each player needed five to eight 
kernels of corn, blackened on one side. Holding 
ail the grains In one hand, the players tossed 
them on the ground, each player having three 
throws. The winner made the greatest number of 
points In the aggregate. Each "black" kernel 
counted one point, ail "white" kernels counted 
either five or seven points, according to the 
number of kernels used. 

Another common way to enjoy leisure time 
was playing marble games. Bets consisted of 
anything available from pocket knives, to ponies 
and saddles. Five marbles were placed in a 



square, one marble at each corner and one in the 
center. Each player shot in turn from about 20 to 
25 paces from the square. The one who knocked 
all the marbles out of the square, or who knocked 
out the center marble was the winner. 

During the hot months of the year, a favorite 
pastime of the boys and men was trying to swim 
a wide stream to a certain point on the opposite 
bank, blindfolded. The first man to reach the goal 
was declared the winner. 

Another amusement Involving boys and 
young men was rolling down hills while wrapped 
and tied In blankets or skins. The first one to 
reach a certain line was the winner. 

The Choctaws also enjoyed swimming. One 
game, called the Alligator, was begun by 
everyone starting to undress at the same time. 
The one who undressed last and jumped in the 
water was to begin the game. If anyone was 
caught with any part of their body above water, 
he was called chicken and was put out of the 
game. If caught underwater, the trapped boy 
could not struggle but had to stay under water as 
long as possible until one of the other players had 
to go up for air. No one under 18 was allowed to 
participate in the game, and the ability to swim 
was a manda* ; requirement. 

Government: Punishment for breaking the law 
included fines, whipping and death. No jails were 
built In early years for Choctaws, and their use 
was never common. It was a matter of honor for 
one who was accused of breaking the law to 
appear for trial and to suffer such punishment as 
the courts might decree. If a Choctaw man was 
charged with a crime and failed to come to court, 
he was stigmatized as a coward. If a sentence of 
death was pronounced by the Court, the Choctaw 
was allowed to go free for a period of time. As a 
matter of honor, ho would appear at the 
appointed hour to suffer the penalty of death by 
the shot of a rifle. 

Murder was the worst crime recognized by 
the Choctaws, and the life of the murderer was 
invariably claimed by the friends or relatives of the 
victim. It Is said that murderers seldom attempted 
to escape, holding it a duty to their families to 
receive the punishment of death. To attempt to 
escape was regarded as a cowardly act, reflecting 
on every member of the family. If, however, a 
murderer did succeed In escaping, another 
member of the family usually was required to die 
in his stead.

MYTHS AND LEGENDS 



Legend of Creation 

A Superior Being, in the appearance of a red 
man, came down from above and landed near the 
center of the Choctaw Nation. He threw up a large 
mound or hill, called in their language Nanih Waya 
which means "stooping or sloping hill." When this 
was done, he caused the red people to come out 
of it, and when he supposed that a sufficient 
number had come out, he stamped on the ground 
with his foot. When this signal of his power was 
given, some of the Indians were partly formed, 
others were just raising their heads above the mud, 
emerging into light, and struggling into life. The red 
people being thus formed from the earth were 
seated on the area of the hill. Their Creator told 
them that they should live forever. However, they 
did not understand him. They asked him what he 
had said, and he took away the promise of 
immortality he had given them and told them they 
would become subject to death. 

When the Creator had formed the red people 
from the ground and fitted the earth for their 
residence, he told them the earth would bring forth 
spontaneously the chestnut, hickory nut and acorn 
for their subsistence. Accordingly, the Choctaws in 
ancient times lived principally upon these products 
of the earth. They supposed that it was not unti! 
sometime after they had become a people that the 
corn which now forms a considerable part of their 
food was discovered by means of a crow. 

How Corn Came To The Choctaws 

One year a great drought came and soon 
there was no game for the people to eat. The 
Choctaw people were faced with starvation. 

Two young men who were leaders of their 
people determined that they would go out and 
search for food. They made a holy vow that they 
would find food for their people or die in the 
attempt. 

"Perhaps we have unknowingly done evil and 
offended the Great Spirit," they said. "If we are 
unable to find food, perhaps we can give our sins, 
and the Great Spirit will take away his displeasure 
and give our people life again." 

Wearily, they made a bed on the floor of the 
forest and they lay down lo sleep, each sure in his 
own mind that he would not awaken. 

While they slept, both of the young men had 
the same dream. Each of them dreamed that he 



saw a black bird flying overhead, and shot it with 
his arrow. He cleaned the bird, built a fire, then 
roasted it. In the dream, both men could smell the 
sweet fragrance of the roasting fowl, and nothing 
ever smelled so good. 

Just as he was about to eat the bird, he heard 
a moaning cry. He looked about and, in the path 
of the moon, he saw a woman who cried out, "Help 
me! I will die unless you give me some food." 

Without stopping to consider his own hunger, 
each young man gave the dream woman his own 
roasted bird and watchec as she devoured It. As 
she ate, a great change came over her. She 
became young and beautiful. Her hair was long 
and golden like the sun. Her eyes were as blue as 
summer skies. Her gown swirled in green folds 
around her body, and she wore a string of pearls 
that reached almost to the ground. She held out 
her hand to the young man and said, "You have 
saved my life, and I shall reward you. Meet me 
here a year from this time." With no further word, 
she vanished in the moon's path. 

Each young man awoke the next morning 
feeling young and whole again and ready to tell the 
other what he had dreamed. Imagine their surprise 
when one started to tell the other, only to have him 
interrupt and say, "I know, my brother, for I 
dreamed the same thing." Surely this was no 
ordinary dream, but a vision sent from the Great 
Spirit, they concluded. 

They knew that things had changed for the 
better when they started back to camp and 
discovered enough deer to take care of their 
starving people. 

The year passed, and the young men kept the 
words of the dream woman in their hearts. They 
kept the time with bundles of sticks, throwing away 
a stick each day until they knew that the time was 
coming when they were to ke*o their meeting with 
the beautiful woman of their e<> .;S. 

When the time came, the, lurried to the spot 
where they had camped a year before, but no one 
was there. "It was only a dream after all," they toid 
each other sadly. Then, as they looked toward the 
path of the moon, they saw a plant they had never 
seen before. It was tall and green with something 
which they supposed to be fruit growing from it. 
Long, golden, silky threads came from the fruit 
which reminded them of the golden hair of the 
woman just as the large green leaves reminded 
them of her gown. They plucked the fruit and 
pulled aside the golden silk to see that there were

many rows of grain like her pearls. 

The dream woman has sent us a gift to 
emind us of her," one said. This is toncha, or 
corn; the other said, "and truly It is a gift of the 
Great Spirit." 

The young men roasted the ear of corn and 
found it was very good. They tried many ways of 
preparing the corn, and it was delicious every time. 
"Never again will we be dependent on animals for 
food. We can grow the toncha, and it will sustain 
us," they said. They resolved that in the future 
when the corn was in the roasting ear stage each 
year, they would hold the Green Corn Dance to 
honor the woman of their dreams who had brought 
them the gift of corn. 

The Hunter Who Became A Deer 

One night a hunter killed a doe, and soon 
afterward fell asleep near the carcass. The next 
morning, just at sunrise, the hunter was surprised 
and startled to see the doe raise her head and 
speak, asking nlm to go with her to her home. At 
first, he was so surprised that he did not know what 
to reply, so the doe again asked him whether he 
would go. Then the hunter said that he would go 
with her, although he had no idea where she would 
lead him. 

So they started, and the doe led the hunter 
through forests and over high mountains until at 
last they reached a large hole under a rock which 
they entered. Here, the hunter was led before the 
king of all the deer. He was an immense buck with 
huge antlers and a large black spot on his back. 
Soon the hunter became drowsy and finally he fell 
asleep. 



Now, all around the cave wet9 piles of deer's 
feet, antlers, and skin. While the hunter was asleep, 
the deer endeavored to fit deer feet to his hands 
and feet. After several unsuccessful attempts, the 
fourth set proved to bo just the right size and was 
fastened securely on the hunter's hands and feet. 
Then a skin was found that covered him properly, 
and finally antlers were fitted to his head. The 
hunter had become a deer and he walked on four 
feet just like a deer. 

Many days passed. The hunter's mother and 
all his friends thought he had been killed. One day 
when they were in the forest, they found his bow 
and arrows hanging on a branch of the same tree 
beneath which he had slept beside the body of the 
doe. All his friends and relatives gathered around 
the spot and began singing. Suddenly they saw a 
herd of deer bounding toward them through the 
forest. The deer circled around the singers. One 
large buck approached closer than the others, and 
the singers, rushing forward, caught it. To the 
great astonishment of all, it spoke. They 
recognized the voice as that of the lost hunter. 

Greatly distressed, the hunter's mother begged 
her companions to remove from her son the deer 
skin, antlors and feet, but they told her he would 
certainly die if they did so. She insisted however, 
saying she would rather bury her son than have 
him remain a deer. So her friends began tearing 
away the skin which already had grown to the 
hunter's body, and as they continued their efforts to 
remove it, the Wood began to flow. Finally the 
hunter died. His body was taken back to the 
village, and he was burled with the ceremony of a 
great dance.

Counting from right to left, the raised little 
finger and ring finger of the right hand 
were two; the addition of the middle 
finger was three, etc. Six is indicated by 
touching the tips of the thumbs together

means "willow" In Latin. Indians boiled 
willow bark in water and took It as a tea 
for relief of headache, fever, and aches 
and pains. Nearly a century after the 
white man learned the Indian remedy, 
aspirin was put on the market. 

Cough syrup at the drug store 
contains alcohol and a flavoring. Many 
home remedies recommend whiskey 
(alcohol) and honey (flavoring) for a 
cough. Both contain grain alcohol. 
Rubbing alcohol is poison if taken 
internally. The Indian medicine may form 
alcohol as it is boiled.

the peace given by the United States of 
America, and friendship reestablished 
between the said states on the one part, 
and all the Choctaw Nation on the other

INTRODUCTION - SECTION 2 



SAC & FOX, KICKAPOO, POTAWATOMI 



Prepared by the Shawnee Public Schools 
Team, the materials presented in this section are 
individual units developed by four different teachers 
for use at the elementary and secondary levels. 

The Social Science Unit on cultural diversity 
could be adapted for use with all grades, but is 
specifically aimed at the 7th grade level. The unit 
could last from 4 to 6 weeks. Much of the unit 
involves the direct participation of students 
interviewing, researching and making presentations 
back to the class as they learn about each area. 
Students will examine things such as stereotypes, 
barriers of prejudice and misunderstandings 
between Indian and non-Indians, and qualities 
which unite all cultures into a common family. 
They will learn that even though all tribes have their 
own unique customs and traditions, they share a 
common bond of "Indianness." Emphasis is on the 
Potawatomi and Sac & Fox tribes, but teachers 
could take the basic outline and apply it to the local 
tribes/tribe in their area. The teacher acts as a 
resource facilitator and instructor. It is an exciting 
unit designed to involve students. 

The Humanities Unit is aimed at the 8th grade 
and could last from 6 to 9 weeks. This unit also 
directly involves ail students. The purpose of this 
unit is to provide information on the American 
Indian, compare three areas (life style, arts/crafts 
and music) and relate these to the American Indian. 
One could take Oklahoma tribes and relate their 
uniqueness in each of these areas. 

The development of each section involved 
using many Indian resource persons. For example, 
in the life styles section, Indian resource persons 
were invited to the school to teach students about 
certain foods, set up classes in shawl making, etc. 
In the arts and crafts section, Indian resource 
persons came to the class and taught various 
forms of art, beaded work and designs. In the 
music section, a mini powwow was held throughout 
the school day, where local Indian persons and 
singers came to a centralized area, sang various 
Indian songs and danced. Classes in the school 
were Invited to come to the powwow by class 
periods and participate in the activity. Total school 
involvement was accomplished in this way. Also an 
art exhibit was held at the end of the unit where 
many of the paintings, drawings, beaded work and 
shawls were displayed at this time. The total unit 
was very successful In accomplishing awareness 
and appreciation. 



The Language Art Unit was designed for 5th 
graders to be used over a period of 2 to 3 weeks. 
This material is presented to give the student an 
idea of what a legend is and what it does. For 
example, in the "Woodpecker Legend" the reader 
will discover what it means to be "free hearted," and 
to have a sense of accomplishment from working. 
In the legend, "Eagle and His Wish," one will 
understand the symbolism related to the eagle. 
These are all brief lessons to allow students to think 
and make decisions that could still relate to their 
lives today. 

The Economics Unit was designed for the 5th 
grade. Again total class involvement made this unit 
successful. Ifs exciting to see how students are 
creative thinkers and organizers if they are allowed 
to be.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON 
AMERICAN INDIAN CULTURE 



America's first inhabitants came to our land 
from the continent of Asia 10,000 to 100,000 years 
ago during the last ice age. These earliest 
immigrants traveled across a land bridge between 
Asia and Alaska. This land bridge was submerged 
under water at the end of the ice age and is now 
known as the Bering Strait (according to one of the 
many theories of Indian migration). 

Since these early immigrants were hunters, the 
probable reason for coming to the North American 
continent was to follow herds of animals migrating 
to America at that time. The hunters did not realize 
they were migrating: continents meant nothing to 
them. 

The Indians did not come all at once, but 
spread their migration over thousands of years. 
Some came looking for a warmer climate; some, 
escaping from enemies; and some, seeking food. 
This is only one of many theories; it is the most 
popular theory. 

Even though the Indians were originally alike, 
their migration covered thousands of years and 
resulted in different languages, appearance, 
customs and ways of living. 

Each group chose a familiar environment and 
adapted themselves to living there. Groups mixed 
with other groups and grew into large tribes which 
spread through North America and South America. 

The tribes were alike in the fact that certain 
tribes had the same sort of culture. They lived in 
the same type of homes, ate the same kind of food, 
and had the same family life and tribal groupings. 
These things that made up the everyday life are 
called "culture." Tribes with similar cultures moved 



toward common living centers. 

At the camp sites of these early people, many 
blackened stones and animal bones give concrete 
evidence that they cooked or roasted meat. Since 
they were on the move, they had no permanent 
habitation. Fire was used for warmth and to keep 
away hostile animals. Natural shelters were scarce 
on the Great Plah ; s ; and these roving bands had to 
endure heat, cold, ilrxxJc. storms and accidents. 

Their only means of transportation was 
walking. Although horses brought by Spaniards In 
the 1500's were a part of the game on the plains, 
these early Americans never domesticated them. 
They killed horses for food. The bones of dogs or 
domesticated wolves were found in these camp 
sites and those animals may have been used as 
pack animals for moving from one camp site to 
another and for food in times of scarcity. 

Since these hunters had no horses, they had 
to do their hunting and stalking on foot, using 
whatever natural aids were available to them. 
There were two of these natural aids which were 
used extensively - the waterholes and the small dry 
gulches or "arroyos* 

They would choose a high place about a mile 
away from a waterhole and set up camp. Then 
they could watch the waterhole for the arrival of the 
big animals. When a herd waded in to drink, the 
hunters would dash to the hole, surround one or 
two animals and drive them deeper Into the holes 
so their weight would bog them down in mud. 
Then the hunters could get close to the animal and 
throw their spears Into its head and ribs until it fell. 
The hunters would have to go Into the waterhole

and butcher the animal, removing what hide and 
carcass they could bring out. These they took to 
their camp site where they were prepared for food, 
bone toDls, and skin for clothing and homes. 

Men were using the plains of western 
Oklahoma as a hunting range 60 centuries before 
the great pyramids of Egypt and 90 centuries 
before the Indians' forced removal to southeastern 
Oklahoma. The time of big game hunting came to 
an end in what archaeologists refer to as the 
"Great Disappearance." Studies indicated that the 
great bison, the horse and the camel disappeared 
from the plains by 6,000 B.C. When this happened, 
Indians entered the period of famine. 

Their civilization was already well-developed 
when the first non-Indians set foot on the soil of the 
New World. Each tribe had a government 
structure, well-defined social order, tools, crafts, 
religion, housing, languages, customs, music, art, 
architectural and agricultural techniques. The 
American Indian was quite civilized. 

The Indian taught the white man how to 
survive in this wilderness environment by 
introducing new foods, methods of hunting and 
farming and new types of clothing more suited to 
this land. The Indian would have taught the 
newcomers more about his culture and lifestyle had 
the non-Indian been more receptive to ideas other 
than his own. 

Over the centuries, the culture of the Indians 
has contributed much to our current American 
culture in history, art, music and literature. 
Historically speaking, the Indians have fought in all 
of our wars. Even before our nation was born 
officially, the Indian fought with the French and 
English in their struggle for control of this new land. 
Later, many Indians fought in the Revolutionary War 
and Civil War. As citizens of the United States, 
Indians fought beside other Americans In World 
Wars I and II. 

In our own state, the Indian has a large role in 
nÂ»story. Indian Territory (now Oklahoma) was the 
region set aside for the home of the Indians from 
it>30 to 1906. These Indians had been removed 
from their homes east of the Mississippi River to the 
Great Plains to make room for non-Indian settlers 
on the east. Originally, this area was assigned to 
the Five Tribes: the Cherokee, Choctaw, 
Chickasaw, Creek and Seminole. At this time the 
Indians were allowed to govern themselves. 

In 1866, these tribes had to give up the 
western portion of Indian Territory for other Indians' 
use. This was partly due to the North's retaliation 
for some Indian support of the South during the 



Civil War. Reservations in this area were set aside 
at various times for the Osage, Arapaho, Cheyenne, 
Wichita, Kiowa and Comanche. 

In 1887, the United States government broke 
up tribal land holdings. 

In 1889, some of the land was opened up for 
non-Indian settlement. 

In 1898, the Indians were brought under 
United States laws and control, and in 1901 ail 
Indian Territory Indians became United States 
citizens. In 1924, all other Indians were given their 
citizenship in the United States. 

Languages: The Indians had more than 160 
different languages and 1,200 dialects. There are 
six recognized Indian language families. They are: 
Algonkin-Wadashan; Hokan-Sicuan; Penutian; 
Nadene; Aztec-Tanoan and Eskimo-Aleut. Most 
transplanted Indians clung to their own language, 
even though they tended to adopt the ways of their 
neighbors because those ways suited the nature of 
the land. 

A detached tribe modified Its words to suit its 
needs but it kept the grammatical structure of the 
parent language. Distance - even of a few miles - 
could make changes in the language. For 
example, the Five Nations of the Iroquois were all 
in contact with each other constantly, all of the 
same blood, and all essentially under a common 
government, yet their words for the same things 
were pronounced quite differently. (Think of the 
difference in pronunciation of words by people from 
the northeast and southeast United States). 

When man first spoke, he used single words, 
perhaps grunts accompanied by gestures to 
complete meaning. When the need arose to 
express two or more associated ideas, the problem 
was solved by joining together the words for the 
separate ideas into a single new word with perhaps 
a non-essential, syllable left out. Sometimes the 
original meanings were stretched pretty far. Using 
this system, Indians had no trouble forming suitable 
words for things they'd never seen before. For 
example, they produced a word for steamboat that 
meant M walks-on-the-water. M 

The names for most Indian tribes were derived 
from what other tribes called them or those names 
that were given by explorers. Their names for them- 
selves almost always meant "the men" or "the 
people." 

Occupations: The job of the Indian man was to 
provide meat for his people. Game was scattered, 
so the finding and stalking of it took much time 



ERLC 



120 



J32 



and effort. When the man was not hunting (which 
was seldom) he had to make or repair hunting and 
transportation equipment, which took much time 
and skill. There was also some time spent for war 
and defense. 

The job of the Indian women was to keep 
house. Keeping house Included carrying water, 
chopping or gathering firewood, cooking, tanning 
leather, making clothes, raising children (in some 
tribes the grandparents tended to the children), 
gathering vegetables, roots and berries to 
supplement the diet. The woman also made her 
own household furniture, utensils, and tools. 

Manners and Demeanor: Collectively, Indians 
were generous and extremely hospitable. They 
looked with disgust upon the white man who 
wouldn't share his house, food and pipe with a 
friend or stranger. Even a declared enemy who 
came in peace to an Indian lodge was fed and 
given a place to sleep in complete security. 

View of Environment: The white man had a 
tendency to want to change nature -- destroy 
forests, dam rivers, build roads. He killed and 
wasted many of the valuable animals that provided 
food and clothing to the Indian. The Indian felt at 
home in the outdoors, his natural environment. He 
saw living creatures everywhere, observed them, 
learned their habits, marveled at their techniques o* 



escaping him and their humanlike ways. He felt 
that the forest was a living thing, even the winds 
and clouds had unseen supernatural powers. In 
short, the Indian greatly loved and respected the 
earth and nature which is best illustrated by 
traditional Indian legend. 

Religion and Superstition: The Indian was very 
toierant and respectful of others' beliefs. In fact, 
the name "Great Spirit" was introduced to him by 
the non-Indian. (All tribes have always believed in 
a Supreme Being, but the name used for this 
Supreme Being was different with each tribe.) 
Originally, some Indians were unseen power, will or 
spirit. Great powers existed everywhere In nature. 
The wind, sun, rain and animals possessed this 
power which could either Jielp or hinder man. 
Indians have always adapted to nature and their 
environment. 

Appeals or prayers could be offered to these 
"spirits" for help, strength or guidance. Some 
Indians had a special totem l Â» guardian spirit which 
would look after him. The Indian would usually 
carry some symbol or representation of this animal 
with him. In legends, there are many super 
. animals, such as the white buffalo which helped the 
individual or a whole tribe. (As one investigates 
different tribes, one will learn that all believed In a 
"Supreme Being/)

MYTHS AND LEGENDS 



Woodpecker Legend 

Once upon a time, grandmother had two 
beautiful grandchildren. She raised them to 
womanhood. She tried to explain to them how to 
dress and how to behave and how to carry on - heir 
traditions. 

She told them that there were three things that 
they must do before they were qualified to leave 
home and marry. If they did not do these things, 
something would happen to them, and they would 
become an "outcast", she said. 

The grandmother told her two granddaughters 
to go out into the forest and get some wood. So 
they did. 

The youngest granddaughter brought in an 
armful of wood. The oldest granddaughter brought 
in two sticks. 

Grandmother looked at the oldest 
granddaughter and said, "What does this mean?" 

The granddaughter said, "I do not like to 
gather wood. My sister has brought some." 

The grandmother said, "You both sit down and 
eat some soup. Tomorrow we will rise early. There 
will be a spell cast on you if you don't listen to 
what your grandmother says." 

So early the next morning, she gave them a 
basket. 

"Now go out into the mountains, and pick 
some berries, 14 she told them. "Each one of you 
must bring a full basket so that we may eat them 
and preserve them for the winter." So they left. 

The oldest granddaughter returned with a 



handful of berries. She had a purple mouth. She 
looked at her grandmother. Her grandmother 
looked at her with disgust. The grandmother 
demanded, "What is the meaning of this?" 

The granddaughter said, "Well, I got tired and 
I ate berries." 

Late that evening, the other granddaughter 
came in. Her basket was full. She presented it to 
her grandmother. She said, "Grandmother, here 
they are. There are plenty of berries. We shall go 
sometime and pick some more so you can 
preserve them for the winter. I have not touched 
one." 

Early the next morning, grandmother told the 
granddaughters that this would be the last task. 
"You will each make some bread out of the 
cornmeal that has been preserved. Each one must 
make plenty of bread," she said. So they did. 

They kneaded the bread and baked it. The 
oldest granddaughter made two loaves. One was 
large and one was small. She said, H l will eat the 
largest one and put the small one in a bowl. M 

The younger granddaughter said, "Grand- 
mother told us to make plenty." 

"Well, I don't care. Mine Is large," said the 
oldest. 

"You have made small ones. Why should I 
make this bread?" 

Soon the grandmother came. She saw thern. 
She looked at the bread. She looked at the 
younger girl and then at the older granddaughter. 
She said, "What does it take to make you realize 
what you have done? I am disgusted. The time 



ERLC 



123 

135 



has coma" 

"I have lost everything I had thought of you. 
The younger granddaughter will stay. She will grow 
up to be a beautiful maiden. As for you, I will paint 
your hair red, and you must put on this black cloak 
of buckskin and your yellow legglns. 

'There Is the door. You must leave and never 
return. Hereafter, you have to go out and hunt 
your food and beg for your food and strive for 
everything that you get. You have not fulfilled what 
I have told you and asked of you," the grandmother 
said. 

She opened the flap of her tlpl. She said, 
"Now fly out of here and go. Never to return. You 
are an "outcast." You shall be a woodpecker." 

Eagle and His Wish 

An Indian boy used to go up on the peak of a 
mountain. He used to stretch his arms out toward 
the valley. He'd look all over. He looked over the 
trees. He looked toward the sky. 

He often wished that he was a bird. He said, 
"I always wished that I was an eagle. I will ask my 
grandmother for a wish and find out how I could 
become an eagle. I will come up here every day." 
So he spread his arms out and he spoke to the 
White Father. He said, "Please help me to be an 
eagle. I wish to be one. They have so much pride 
and dignity and they are graceful. I want to be one. 
Let it be me so that I may teach the people and let 
them usÂ© me. I have heard my elders say, The 
eagle has pride In his work and whatever he does 
and the eagle carries on with pride with their 
wings.' So now I'm going home and I shall sleep. 
I'm going Into the tipi tonight. I may dream of what 
I want to be, and maybe my grandparents will 
permit me to do what I want." 

The next morning he arose, but he was not an 
eagle. Each morning he would go out to the 
mountain and to the White Father. 

Finally one morning his grandmother said, 
"Where did he go? Where Is he? We must find 
him. Something Is wrong." The family went out. 

The grandmother and grandfather looked up 
toward the peak. There they saw an eagle 
perched. Grandpa said, "Do you think that's him?" 

Grandmother said, "I don't know, but I believe 
it is. We will call to him and if he flies to us we will 
know it is him." So they called to him. 

He flew down over the trees to them. So the 
eagle spoke. He said, "Now here I am. I am an 
eagle now. I am graceful. I have pride and dignity. 

"Now I have one wish that I want you to carry 



out. I will spread the word to all Indians of this 
continent to use me In their hair and to paint and 
imitate me in their songs and In their dress. Also, 
they can use me in their ceremonies and whatever 
they wish to carry on. The *Tireat Spirit has given 
me this. I shall fly. i shall drop my feathers In the 
Fall. I shall drop them In the canyons up In the 
mountains where I land. I will fly to my people all 
over the country so that you can use me. 

"My black hair that I wear. My white paint Is 
on my feathers now. My legs are from my yellow 
legglns. Now I wish to tell this to carry on to 
different Indians. We are a proud people and we 
wish to carry on these legends so our great- 
grandchildren will remember us. So wherever you 
go, whatever you do, you will think of me as an 
Indian. I will carry this with me wherever I go, and 
I wish to extend this to my grandchildren. So in the 
near future, they will decorate with feathers and 
have pride in which to carry on their ceremonials. 
That is my wish," he concluded. 

That's why Indians honor eagles now and 
dress with feathers for ceremonials. 

The Story of The Indian Tipi 

A long time ago the Indians lived in caves or 
made houses from bulrush, cattail, mud and reed. 
That was in peace time when everything was 
plentiful, and the Indians were not disturbed and 
were free to build and hunt wherever they wished. 
Each tribe built their homes according to their clan, 
customs and beliefs. 

There was an elderly man In this tribe of 
Indians wondering how he could build a home 
quickly because he liked to wander around to hunt. 
Also he thought of the weather - which material 
could he use that would protect him from the 
weather a; id that was plentiful and handy? 

That night he went to sleep and was very tired 
of thinking what to do for his people. All of a 
sudden, he heard a voice calling out to him saying, 
"Come on brother!" It was a buffalo. Then came a 
deer. They both said, "Follow us Into the forest, 
also into the mountains." So he did. 

The Indian stood and watched. The buffalo 
rubbed its horns against the tree and said, "Cut 
down the straight trees. Strip the bark off until the 
tree is bare. Now 'eed me the bark. Now use this 
bark which Is left to tie your poles. Then spread 
them In a circle with an opening at the top. Now 
take off our skins or hides and sew them together 
in a circle and spread them around the poles." The 
Indian said, "How will I do this?" 



7 lo 

124 4 ^ U 



Then the buffalo said, M Here is my other 
brother, the deer. Use his horns to punch holes 
and use the sinew of our spines to sew with until 
you have covered each pole. Leave an opening at 
the top so you may breathe and look at the stars at 
night and see the North Star of our brother, the 
bear. The bear will guide you at night and also 
may light your pathway. 

Use my horns to stake the bottom sides of the 
skin on the poles. But leave an opening facing east 
so you can always come out in the morning and 
pray to our Creator. Now my brother, as you go 
and where you roam, just think of us. Do not 
destroy us or kill us for nothing. We are your food, 
clothing and home. We will always be with you 
wherever you go even to the end. Bless us all 
times in your prayers and you will gain wisdom and 
power for your people." 

The old man woke up real early the next 
morning, rejoicing and anxious to call to his 
warriors, chiefs, and different tribes to tell them of 
his vision or dream. He said, "I had a wonderful 
dream about our brothers, the buffalo and the deer. 
Hurry! Come, we must go into the forest and 



mountains. Take our bows, arrows and also our 
horses. We have to hunt some buffaloes and deer 
and bring them back to skin the animals for food 
and clothes. 

I will also show you and tell you how to build 
our new homes which we will use from now on. 
We will be aWe to move about fast. Go into the 
forest and pick some straight poles. Strip the bark 
so we may use the strips to tie the poles at the top. 
Now we'll form a 'circle' with the poles then stake 
them down with buffalo horns. 

The women will sew the skins with a deer 
horn and use sinew for thread until we have 
covered the poles in a circle, leading an opening at 
the top and also an opening at the bottom facing 
east. Then when you get up in the morning you 
will come out and pray to our Creator. This is what 
my brothers said. Now go spread the word to our 
people far and near, also to different tribes. 11 

So today, each tribe uses the tipi for 
ceremonial purposes, camping and powwows. They 
are carefully packed and blessed. 

The tipi has been used all over the world by 
different tribes. An Indian's dream came true.

INTRODUCTION ~ ECONOMICS UNIT 
"That Was Then, This Is Mow 11 

By Dorothy Pensoneau 



The objective for this unit was to make each 
student a part of the economic system so that he 
would become a more competent consumer, voter 
and worker. 

At Horace Mann Elementary School in 
Shawnee [in 1977], approximately 58 per cent of 
the students were of Indian descent. Oklahoma 
Indians with an income below poverty level 
compose 32 percent of the Indian population. They 
also have more unemployment and more school 
dropouts than any other American ethnic group. 

We as educators must meet the needs of our 
communities and students by showing them how to 
operate in a multi-ethnic society. To meet that 
need, this economic unit emphasizes the local 
Potawatomi Indian ethnic group. 

Mrs. Dorothy Pensoneau, chose one of her 
fifth grade classes to teach how the economy 
interacts with the Potawatomi Indian. Through 
fiimstrips, research, legends and Indian 
newspapers, her 18 students learned the history of 
the Potawatomi Indians for whom the county was 
named. The students gained an insight into the 
feelings of the Potawatomi by collecting Indian 
poems. An anthology of the Potawatomi poems 
and the students' poems about their attitude toward 
Indians was prepared for future classroom use. 

The economy of the Potawatomi Indians is 
based on a combination of horticulture, hunting, 
fishing, gathering and trade. Students became 
aware of the following problems hindering the 
Potawatomie's economic development: their 
geographical location, education, job opportunities 
and division of the tribe. 

Another goal was to show how everyone is a 
consumer and (should be) a producer by 
demonstrating how economics deals with problems 
of a society. A discussion on food, clothing and 
shelter revealed that the students felt their basic 
needs were being met either by family or 
government agencies (free breakfast and lunch 
program). The personal list of needs and wants 
was expanded to the student's family and 
classroom. As the 18 students examined the 
classroom, they came up with some needs: 
plug-ins, new desks and carpet. Carpet took 
priority over all of them because the students 
wanted to sit on the floor and read. 

How could eighteen students - most of them 
from low-income families - buy carpet for the 



classroom? First, the carpet cost was determined 
by measuring the room and getting estimates from 
carpet companies. The estimate was $400 for a 
serviceable carpet. Students began scanning 
newspaper advertisements for sales on carpet. 
"Every day someone would remark that a certain 
store was having a sale on carpet," Mrs. Pensoneau 
related. 

in November, the Weekly Reader had a story 
on how God's Eyes were used by Indians as gifts 
to their friends for good health. That was the idea 
the class had been waiting for. The cultural 
design's construction directions were included in 
the story. Mrs. Pensoneau commented, This was 
the awakening of a fifth grade class. The Indian 
students related to this article and were ready to 
teach the non-Indian children how to make these. 
Indian parents became involved in supplying 
designs of various tribes. Thus one of the most 
fantastic projects I have ever been involved in 
began." 

With the created need (carpet) and the product 
idea's directions, the students investigated how to 
raise capital to finance material costs. Capital 
could be raised by borrowing or selling stock. "We 
didn't know quite how to go about this (raising 
capital)," Mrs. Pensoneau remembered. "So we 
called in a community resource person 
recommended by the Chamber of Commerce to 
give us a talk on economics." 

The class decided to raise capital by selling 
stock for 25 cents a share. Certificates of stock 
wer? issued to those investing in the company, and 
the students found enough stockholders to provide 
$27.15 for buying the inventory. "We decided what 
our mind could conceive and believe, we could 
achieve," Mrs. Pensoneau said, "So, this became 
our motto." 

The next problem was to set up an assembly 
line. After rearranging the classroom, the students 
developed a production area using old typing 
tables as rows for the assembly line; a store using 
a bookcase at one end of the assembly line for a 
product display; an inventory area using boxes, and 
inspector workbenches using a card table. The 
following equipment was acquired: saw, scissors, 
glue and tape. 

To purchase yard supplies at the best price, 
the students read the newspaper ads and called 
stores. "We became wiser consumers after we tried 



ERLC

using some cotton yarn and found out it wouldn't 
work," Mrs. Pensoneau said. After this experience, 
the students learned to check weight, ounces, 
brand and ply as well as color of yarn. To make the 
product more appealing to customers, the students 
sun/eyed each child's home color schemes which 
showed avocado, orange, blue-green and browns 
were top choices. Yarn in those colors was 
purchased. 

The teacher could not devote much time to 
running the business venture, so the students had 
to set up a company organization. In discussing 
the best leader for the company, the class 
examined the following leadership qualities: attitude 
toward people, willingness to accept management 
responsibility, control emotions, attitude toward self, 
judgment, organization and motivation. The class 
then elected officers with Greg Cullison as 
president. 

At this point, the class voted on the name of 
the company, choosing "OJO," which means God's 
Eye in Spanish. The president assigned each 
student to a job and told what was expected of 
each one. "Greg had capabilities of managing I 
had not dreamed of," Mrs. Pensoneau said. "He 
became tough when necessary, listed and enforced 
safety rules, and kept talking to a minimum. Greg 
was flexible when necessary: certain students had 
to be shifted in various jobs. Greg kept the 
communication line open all the time. He truly was 
a fantastic manager as well as the other officers." 

In support of her comments, Mrs. Pensoneau 
related this incident: "One day the supply boy 
decided Greg had too much authority. Greg asked 
him, 'Haveyou taken care of your job of keeping 
supplies? 1 Charles, the supply boy, said, 'Most of 
the time.' Greg told him to go back and check on 
his job. When Charles checked his supplies, he 
had several balls of yarn that were unraveled and in 
the wrong place. Greg said, Thafs why you are 
not president. You did not assume your 
responsibility. 1 " 

Production was in full force for the Christmas 
season with a high demand for red-and-green Ojo 
ornaments. 

Students discussed money its role, care and 
the responsibility for making correct change. A 
distribution system was organized with students 
(sales people making personal contact and 



displaying the Ojos to the other classrooms once a 
day to sell them). Demand for Ojos was so great 
that children had to come to Mrs. Pensoneau's 
room before school or at lunch in order to buy an 
Ojo. Mrs. Pensoneau's students worked during 
lunch and after school. Mrs. Pensoneau capitalized 
on the selling experience by discussing supply and 
demand. Two sixth-grade students gave the 
students a little competition, but this made the 
quality better, she said. 

After Christmas, the class took only special 
orders on products ranging in price from 10 cents 
to 5 cents. The largest order was placed by the 
DECA Club which purchased 400 Ojos to take to 
Washington, D.C., for a national DECA convention. 

Although the class made a profit of 4 cents per 
share, they could not buy carpeting from their total 
profit of $146.90. After much discussion, the 
students decided to build a tree house in the 
classroom for a reading center (also called loft or 
reading center). 'They particularly wanted to leave 
something of value to the school," Mrs. Pensoneau 
said. 

Plans were drawn, and lumber and labor costs 
were figured. One of the fathers worked with four 
of the students to build the reading center. Rules 
on the use of the tree house were made by the 18 
fifth graders. 

The community learned about the project 
through student salesmen, a PTA program, booths 
at teachers' meetings, and programs for senior 
citizens, the Rotary Club and Kiwanis Club. 

"It truly has been a fantastic year because all 
students became involved," Mrs. Pensoneau said. 
'The greatest reward was to see the development 
of the 18 students' attitudes toward work and 
cooperation to achieve their goal. 

"Yes, they are aware of the past, but they can 
plan a future because That was Then, and This is 
Now.'" 



This unit is a flexible curriculum guide that can 
be adapted to individual classes depending on the 
teacher's time to set objectives and to present the 
material. The teacher should adapt the presenta- 
tion to a classes' grade level and students' 
attention span, intellectual capabilities, cultural 
background and knowledge of the Indians.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
ON THE POTAWATOMI INDIANS 



History 

Traditional history records the Potawatomi, 
Chippewa and Ottawa as one tribe living on the 
upper shores of Lake Huron. By 1700, the 
Potawatomi had moved southward into Illinois and 
had taken over the greater part of the country of 
the annihilated Illinois tribes. Potawatomie land 
claims extended into what is now Indiana. 

In 1833, the Potawatomi ceded much of their 
land to the United States. As a result, most of the 
tribes were living west of the Mississippi River by 
1840. Those that settled in Iowa became known as 
the Prairie Band and those in Kansas as the 
Potawatomi of the Woods. 

In an effort to unite the tribe, a reservation was 
provided for them in Kansas. Here the Potawatomi 
were subjected to grossly unfair treatment by 
settlers. 

In 1861, land allotment was accepted by the 
Kansas Potawatomi who then became known as 
Potawatomi. The Prairie Band refused allotments. 
Withdrawing from tribal relations, they were 
assigned a reservation in Jackson County, Kansas, 
where their descendants are living today 

The majority of the Kansas Potawatomi held 
their allotments to purchase a new reservation in 
Indian Territory with the goal of reestablishing tribal 
relations. 

The new reservation in Indian Territory 
extended from the Canadian River to the North 
Canadian River between the Seminole Nation and 
the Indian Meridian. Today, these members of the 
Algonquian linguistic family remain in the center 
part of the state of Oklahoma near the cities of 
Shawnee, Tecumseh, Maud and Wanette in 
Potawatomi County and Lexington in Cleveland 
County. 

Life Style 

By the 1700s, the Potawatomi Indians were 
well known to the French on the St. Lawrence. 
From the accounts of early French travelers and 
from the investigations of later writers, the 
Potawatomi adapted to their wilderness 
environment. The Potawatomi economy was based 
upon a combination of horticulture, hunting, 
gathering and trade. From the gardens 
surrounding the villages, the Potawatomi women 



cultivated such crops as beans, peas, squash, 
pumpkin, melons and tobacco. They also raised an 
abundance of corn which was traded to the French 
and the Chippewas and other northern tribes. Wild 
rice was harvested along with nuts, roots and 
berries. Crops from their fields were supplemented 
by vegetables gathered from lakes and forests. 

The vegetables in their diet were relieved with 
fish and game. The lakes and streams of the Green 
Bay region abounded in fish which was either 
speared or caught in nets. Much of the fishing was 
done from pine dugouts or birch-bark canoes. 
These vessels also were used to hunt the flocks of 
water fowl that migrated through the bay region in 
the autumn. In surrounding forests and nearby 
prairies, Potawatomi hunters killed deer, bears, 
buffalo and smaller game. During the winters, 
many Potawatomi families left the larger villages to 
establish small hunting camps in unpopulated 
areas. 

Many of the animals which the Potawatomi 
killed for food also furnished skins for clothing. 
Deerskin was fashioned into shirts, leggins and 
moccasins for men and into loose dresses and 
moccasins for women. In the winter, buffalo 
ornamented both deerskin and buffalo clothing with 
dyed porcupine quills or shells and glass beads. 
As the Potawatomi traded with the French, they 
replaced their traditional deerskin costume with 
cotton shirts and ieggins and with dresses of 
brightly colored materials. 

Potawatomi men unally shaved their heads 
except for a scalp lock. When going to war, 
warriors adorned themselves with red and black 
paint. Both sexes painted their faces and bodies 
for ceremonial occasions. 

Potawatomi lived in wigwams which were 
dome-shaped structures of woven reed mats 
attached to a frame built of poles. The mats were 
easily detached so they could carry them when 
moving, inside could be found such Implements of 
everyday life as extra clothing, storage, vessels and 
cooking utensils. Potawatomi women made 
baskets and bags from the bark of such trees as 
the white cedar, and the Indians' other containers 
were made of elm and hickory bark or of animal 
skins. Prior to French contact, Potawatomi women 
used mussel shells as spoons and ladles, but by 
the end of the 1700s, such common trade items as 
iron kettles and metal utensils were utilized.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON 
ECONOMICS FOR POTAWATOMI INDIANS 



I. The importance of economics and the 
nature of understanding economics. 

A. Why is economics important to the 
Potawatomi Indians? 

1 . It deals with multiplicity of every day 
problems affecting their lives 

a. unemployment 

b. alcoholism is an escape from 
boredom, lack of education 

c. dropout of school 

d. suicide rates increase with age 

2. The economy of the Potawatomi 
Indians affect the total society. Their 
unemployment problem drains the 
community's welfare fund. 

3. Every student has the responsibility 
to a society to understand the 
consequences of their economic III. 
actions based on the decisions they 
make. 

4. Teaching and training in economic 
analysis causes the person to think 
objectively and rationally about 
problems. 

5. Every problem has a solution. Once 
the problem is detected, it can be 
solved. 

B. What is economics? 

1 . Economics is concerned with society 
as a whole and with the activities of 
various groups who make up society, 
including each consumer and 
producer. 

2. Economics is a social science and 
seeks to solve problems in a rational 
way by identifying goals, alternative 
ways of reaching them and conse- 
quences of each decision. 

3. Economic understanding means one 
possesses certain skills, including the 
ability to interpret statistics, certain 
tools of analysis (economic theory) 
and a sense of the historical evolution 
of human events. 

II. The major economic problem in all 
societies: wants, scarce resources, the 
need for decision making and the need for 
an economic system. 



ERLC 



A. Economic wants [in 1977]. 

1 . People's wants vary because of 
internal influences (family, income, 
goals, values and life styles) and the 
external influences (advertising, other 
communication media) that affect 
their behavior. 

2. Economic lives of the Potawatomi 
changed as they moved from various 
geographical locations. 

3. Ask an Indian resource person about 
the Indians' attitude toward material 
satisfactions. 

4. Potawatomi Indians' choices are limit- 
ed because of their unemployment 
and low income. 

5. Wants and needs are not the same. 

What is an economic system? 

A. An economic system is the mechanism by 
which labor, resources and skills are 
brought together to produce and 
distribute the enormous amount of things 
people need and want. 

B. Three basic questions to ask: 

1 . What goods and services will be pro- 
duced? 

2. How will they be produced, who will 
produce them and what resources 
will be used? 

3. Who will use these goods and 
services? 

C. We have a market economy which 
involves decision making by the 
consumer, producers and government. 

D. In Indian Territory days, the government 
exercised little control in the decisions 
made by the tribe. 

1. We have a mixed economy in which 
three groups play a major role. 

a. Consumers look for the best 
value in return for what they 
spend. 

b. Producer seeks the best income 
for what they offer. 

c. Government (federal, state and 
local) seeks to promote the 
safety and welfare of the public 
and provides services in the 
public interest. 

142 



i. Health benefits (CHR - 
Community Health Repre- 
sentatives) 

ii. Work programs (JTPA - 
Job Training Partnership 
Act) 

iii. Environmental services 
What makes it work? 

A. You, in your role as a consumer, play the 
key role in making our economy work. 

1. Consumer-based needs were met by 
the Potawatomis even though it took 
many hours of hard work. 

2. Indian men united together for the 
hunt to provide food, clothing and 
shelter. 

3. A lack of unity hindered the Potawat- 
omi from improving their economic 
standards. 

B. Some workers produce goods; others 
produce services. All are called 
producers. 

1. Individual self-sufficiency was 
characteristic of the earlier 
Potawatomi Indians. 

2. Today we rely on others to produce 
what we need and we pay for those 
needs with our wages and salary. 

3. Workers are producers. They apply 
their basic skills and energies to 
change resources into goods and 
services. 

a. How does the work force look 
today? 

b. Compare the Oklahoma Indian 
work force with the Potawatomi/ 
Indian work force. 

4. People starting business are 
producers. 

a. Grants can be obtained for this 
purpose from the government to 
help Potawatomi Indian economy 
grow. 

5. Managers are producers because 



they plan, organize and implement 
their plans. 

a. Mini-training courses are offered 
to Potawatomi Indians for 
managing businesses. 
6. Investors are producers because they 
supply the money needed to build 
and operate facilities, and to 
purchase equipment and raw 
materials. 

a. Banks, savings and loan 
associations, and the stock 
market put the savings of people 
into operation. 

V. The Government part of our economic 
system. 

A. The government helps with decisions to 
uphold the Preamble of the Constitution. 

B. There are five basic areas in which 
government on national, state and local 
levels are involved. 

1. Protect the rights and freedoms of 
individuals - economic, political, and 
religious. 

2. Provide services and goods to benefit 
each of us - highways, education, 
and national defense. 

3. Regulation to promote fair economic 
competition, and protection of health 
and safety. 

4. Promote economic growth and 
stabilization through diversity of 
economic policies. 

5. Give direct support tojndividuals who 
cant meet basic needs. 

C. Expenditures are fantastic. Functions 
cost money which is raised by: 

1. Taxing individuals and businesses. 

2. Borrowing 

VI. The American economic system is the 
result of the interaction between human 
and material resources and man's belief in 
life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

SUGGESTED ACTIVITIES: 

The students may learn how: 

â€¢ Economics deals with the problems of a 
society. The Potawatomle Indians are a 
part of society. Write a paper on the 
aconomic problems of the Potawatomi. 

â€¢ Unemployment is a concern with the 
Potawatomi Indians. Lack of education 
hinders the Indians from becoming an 
efficient producer. Write a paper on how 
unemployment and lack of education hinder 
a person from being a good producer and 
consumer. 

â€¢ Economics seeks to solve problems in a 
rational way by identifying goals, alternative 
ways of reaching them and consequences 
of each decision. Write a paper explaining 
how the Potawatomi Indians can solve their 
economic problems (refer to geographical 
location). 



â€¢ Interview an Indian resource person on the 
causes and effects of school dropouts. 

â€¢ Write a factual statement using figures on 
unemployment and comparing the different 
tribes. 

â€¢ Ask a community resource person to 
explain economics. Write a synopsis of 
how economics affect the student and his 
family. Economic wants vary because of 
internal and external influences that affect 
behavior. Write a paper on how the 
Potawatomie Indians are going to have to 
modify their values to become producers. 

â€¢ Analyze in a written report the Potawatontfs 
cultural items unique to white man's society 
that Potawatomis could produce. Describe 
a process for building a company to 
produce this item(s). Check newspaper 
ads for ideas on products and 
merchandising.

AREA: 

OBJECTIVES: 



Social Studies 

To learn of homes, transportation, food and clothing of Plains Indians. 

Homes ~ The tipi was the main type of home because they moved so 
often. Some Indians drew pictures on their tipis about family stories. The 
buffalo was the main source of hide for the tipi. 

Transportation - Indians traveled by foot when as they didnt always 
have horses on which to do their hunting. Dogs were used when the 
Plains Indians moved, by pulling a travois. Horses were used a great 
deal. 

Food - The Plains Indians ate meat from buffalo, deer, squirrel, and 
birds. They ate foods that grew wild and prepared pemmican which is 
pounded meat mixed with melted fat and dried berries. 

Clothing - They used skins of buffalo and deer.

Pottery 
2-6 

Arts and Crafts 

To acquaint students with techniques and materials of Indian pottery making. 

Research the methods Indians used to develop different colors of paint and dye 
and how Indians mixed their clay. Homeroom mothers can be recruited to help 
with this project. 

Place two pieces of 1/2" X 1" X 12" wood sticks eight (8) inches apart. Place 
a lump of clay the size of a fist between the sticks and roll out with a rolling 
pin. Use the sticks as a guide to make sure the clay is the same thickness 
throughout. Place the clay inside an oiled buttertub. Smooth with wet fingers. 
If the clay dries too fast, it will crack, so put it in a plastic bag with holes. After 
it is dry enough to come loose from the skies of the butter tub, take the pottery 
out and fifl cracks with slips. Put back in bag and leave for 3 or 4 days until 
dry, then sand the pottery with coarse sand paper. Draw designs with pencil, 
paint the designs with underglaze and fire in kiln. Paint with glaze and fire 
again.

POTTERY-MAKING INSTRUCTIONS 



Coiled Pottery. Because of its simplicity, the coil 
system of making pottery is an excellent one with 
which to start your first experiments. Either kind of 
clay may be used - the self-hardening type or the 
kind that is hardened by firing. Despite its 
simplicity, beautifully finished vases, bowls, and 
other types of pottery can be made by this method. 

Start out with drawing a profile of the vase, 
bowl, or other object that you are going to make. 
You should make the drawing ten percent larger 
than the finished pot is to be to allow for shrinkage 
due to water evaporating from the clay when it 
dries out. 

The first step is to make the base of the pot. 
This can be cut from a slab of clay, as shown in 
illustration A, or can be shaped up into circular 
form of the right diameter by wrapping a coil 
around and around. It is a good idea to make the 
base on a piece of strong paper or a moistened 
plaster work bat, which will prevent the clay from 
sticking to your work table. It is also well to cut out 
a circle of paper of the size of the base to serve as 
a guide. 

If you are using a day that is to be fired, make 
the base by cutting it from a rolled out slab of 
thoroughly wedged clay. This will reduce the 
danger of airholes which might cause explosions 
during firing. 



Making a coiled base is a little simpler if you 
taper the end of the coil that Is to be In the middle. 
Draw the damp sponge along the coil to moisten it 
slightly and prevent its cracking. Then form the 
tapered end into a smaller circular mass and wrap 
the coil around and around it. Press the coils 
closely together so that no airholes will be left 
between them. 

Now smooth out the clay by rubbing your 
fingers over the coils. Smooth both the top and 
bottom of the base this way. Then trim the base 
into perfect circular forms, using your paper guide 
and, if needed, a knife. 

Now make a cardboard template by tracing 
one side of the drawing on a piece of cardboard 
and cutting along the line showing the shape of the 
pot. This gives you a template of the same shape 
as the outside contour of the pot. 

The next step is to build up the sides of the 
pot. Before putting the first coil in place, roughen 
the rim of the base by checking or small cutting, 
scratching shallow lines with a modeling tool or 
some other pointed instrument. Taper the end with 
a small brush. When you have used up the first 
coil, and start using the second one, join the two 
together by splitting the end of one and tapering 
the end of the other. Then moisten the clay and 
model the two pieces together.

Building the Pot 



The pot Is to built up of coils of soft clay. To 
make the colls, roll a slab of clay about 1/4" thick. 
Cut a 1/2" strip from this slab and roll it gently 
under your palms until it is a smooth coil. If clay 
that must be fired Is being used, there must be no 
cracks in the coil, as these might form airholes in 
the finished pot. 



The right consistency for the day is 
determined by the reaction of a coil when it Is bent. 
If it cracks, it is too stiff and more water must be 
added. Coils generally range from 3/8" In diameter 
for small articles to 1" in diameter for the largest 
sizes. The best rule is to make each coil just 
before it Is to be used. It Is advisable to have a 



ERLC 



141 

153 



damp sponge on hand to moisten your fingers as 
you make the coils and build the pot. 

As you build up the sides of the pot, and later 
as you smooth the clay, use the your template at 
each step to make sure that the pot is assuming 
the finished shape you planned. This is done by 
holding the finished template at each step to make

Slip Where Necessary 



widening or pressing coils, whichever may be 
needed. 

When the pot is about one-half built up, 
smooth the clay both Inside and out by rubbing 
your fingers on it. You may wish to leave the coils 
unrubbed.

D. The Finished Pot 



If the pot is to curve in, carry the coil to the 
inside of the one below it. If it is to curve out, carry 
the coH to the outside of the preceding one. Work 
with your fingers on the inside and outside as you 
do the coHing. 

The pot is completed by smoothing its upper 
half and trueing up the shape ail around by the use 
of the template. If there are irregular parts that 
needing correction after the clay has dried, you can 
smooth them into shape with coarse sandpaper. 

If you wish to make a lid, make it in the same 



way as the base and add a knob of clay. 

If self-hardening ciay has been used, you can 
paint the finished pot with any design that is 
appropriate to its size and shape. If the pot Is to 
be fired, it may be decorated with a design painted 
with underglaze colors or may be given an all-over 
coating of colored glaze.

"Cypress Tree" 



The cypress tree is located on the west bank 
of Mountain Fork River at the Old Bethabara 
Crossing. It is estimated to be more than 2,000 
years old. The tree is more than 100 feet tall with 
a circumference of 45-feet, making it one of the 
largest known cypresses in this country. A 



lightening rod has been fixed in its already 
shattered top to preserve it from future storms. It 
is located near the home of Choctaw Chief 
Jefferson Gardner on U.S. 70, built in 1884 near 
Eagletown. 



The Big Cypress" 



For many days they had marched westward. 
Mississippi, their old home, was far behind. Even 
when they left, the white man's axe was destroying 
forever their old hunting grounds, and his plow 
turned up the bones of their loved ones. 

Slowly they waded across the blue, rippling 
waters of the Mountain Fork River. Camp was 
made for the night. Their long journey was ended. 
They were now in their new homeland. It was 
impossible to forget the old home beyond the 
father of waters or the unmarked graves of those 
whose strength had not been equal to the long trail. 
Still they tried to forget all those things. They must 
not pause to look backward. The Choctaw never 
looked backward! 

The evening meal was, over. Night came 
swiftly after the golden curtains of the setting sun 
had faded. Many campfires gave light to the camp. 
The insects serenaded the new arrivals with concert 
after concert. The wise old owls came and 
chattered scolding welcomes from the safe, dark 
tops of the tall trees. 

A horn sounded above the voices of the night. 
It was the call to the council. Slowly they left their 
campfires and gathered around the large council 
fire. Soon their voices blended in singing songs of 
hope and gratitude to a loving heavenly father. 
Prayers were offered, and they then sat in reverent 
silence meditating the task of building homes in the 
new land. The insects played in muffled tones. 



The owls were silent. A gentle breeze stirred the 
lace-like foliage of the giant cypress trees. The 
pines merely nodded to each other. The Choctaw 
remained seated in the reverent silence around the 
dying embers of the council fire. 

From the top of a cypress came a voice as 
pleasant as the music of many waters. 

The Choctaw are now in the new homeland. 
The long journey is over. Let the Choctaw build 
cabins and enjoy this new hunting ground. As a 
monument to the heroic suffering and fortitude of 
the Choctaw on this big journey, this cypress shall 
become the largest tree between the great eastern 
mountains and the mighty mountains toward the 
going down of the sun. The Great Spirit has 
spoken." 

This great tree, now famous, is known as the 
largest tree in Oklahoma. 



(Often the great story of a people is 
caught up in a legend that not only 
relates the story of that people, but also 
reflects their innermost thoughts and 
feelings, revealing their close 
communion with God and harmony with 
the universe. Such a story is 'The Big 
Cypress, 0 told by the Choctaw as told to 
Dr. R. M. Firebaugh by Edmund Gardner, 
a Choctaw Indian, 1935.)

SOCIAL STUDIES 
OKLAHOMA AND AMERICAN INDIAN HISTORY 
INTRODUCTION 



The first Americans to discover what is now 
Oklahoma were the early American Indian tribes. 
They lived on this land and called it home for 
centuries before the first explorers came. Yet, 
Indian history is omitted from the study of 
Oklahoma, or it is treated so superficially that it 
does not adequately show the Native Americans' 

Developers 



contributions to the discovery and development of 
this land which became Oklahoma. 

For this reason we have developed a social 
studies component for the study of Oklahoma and 
American Indian History which will help students 
understand many of the varied cultures which are 
indigenous to this state.

PHILOSOPHY 



The history of people is a continual evolvement 
of their culture entwined with events and conditions 
of the total environment. Through the study of 
certain American Indian tribes, an enriched 
perspective may be attained to enlighten one's 
learning and understanding of the original American 
people. 



With basic knowledge of the development of 
certain American Indian tribes, one may learn that 
the distinctiveness of tribal heritage has had 
significant impact on the history of our country. 

The history of the American Indian is 
impressive - the uniqueness of tribes is depicted 
through their lifestyles, colorful and practical, and 



ERLC 



147 

159 



their relations, full of conflict and tragedy. Factual 
portrayal is imperative in clarification of historical 
events pertaining to the tribes and their relations 
with other cultures. 

The American Indian is due proper recognition. 
Tribes have contributed tremendously to the wealth 
and growth of this nation. The study of Oklahoma 
and American history should include broader 
perspectives of the varied and interesting cultures 



who are part of the total American society. History 
shows people in their forms of development and 
will always provide insight into our existence. 

The wealth of resources and documentation on 
the American Indian is evident. This social studies 
component has been developed to provide valuable 
guidelines for further study of the American Indian 
in history. 



GOALS 

1. To develop respect and a healthy concept of the American Indian. 

2. To learn about the Indian history in Oklahoma. 



OBJECTIVES 

1. To familiarize the student with pre-historical concepts of the first people in America. 

2. To introduce the student to the ancestral background of early American Indians who 
were indigenous to Oklahoma. 

3. To describe how the lives of the Indian tribes in Oklahoma were affected by their contact 
with early explorers, traders, and settlers. 

4. To study brief, historical backgrounds on several tribal nations, specifically the Plains and 
Five Tribes regarding: 

a. Linguistic family 

b. Location 

c. Characteristics 

d. Removal 

5. To study important United States legislation pertaining to American Indian Affairs. 

6. To review current issues of American Indians during contemporary history. 

7. To explore types of activities which may provide broader perspectives and fuller 
participation of all students in the study of Indian culture.

UNIT ONE 



HISTORICAL BACKGROUND 



I. ORIGINS OF THE ANCESTRAL INDIANS 

Thousands of years ago, there were no people 
in the Americas. Many believe that the continent 
was first Inhabited as a result of Asian migrations. 
Between Siberia and Alaska, during Pleistocene 
Glacial Age or the Ice Age, a land bridge or bridges 
existed. During this period, more snow fell in the 
winter than melted In the summer, and many 
enormous glaciers were formed. Some were 
almost two miles thick. The sea levels were lower 
than today, because a large part of the world's 
water was involved in the glaciers. For thousands 



of years, the Bering Strait was dry land with grass 
and flowers. The land bridge disappeared, and the 
Bering Strait took its present form. 

Twenty-five to thirty-five thousand years ago, 
people who lived by hunting followed animals into 
North America. People IMng in Europe or Asia at 
this time were mostly hunters. The animals they 
hunted were driven out of Europe toward Asia 
during the Ice Age. Many animals then began to 
move north and east across the land bridge and 
south into the warmer climate of North America. 




The Bering Strait land 
bridge during the last 
glacial period and the ice- 
free corridor that provided 
access from Siberia to 
Alaska and then to the 
North and South American 
continents.

The people probably traveled in small bands, or 
family groups, as those dependent upon hunting 
usually do. It is doubtful there were a number of 
migratory movements of people across the Bering 
Strait over a long period of time, as they followed 
the movement of animals they hunted. 

The majority of these people were believed to 
be from the Mongolian race. Successive waves of 
migrations across the land bridge were almost 
entirely people of Asia. We, therefore, find present 
day American Indians racially classified as 
Mongolians. Studies of linguistic diffusion suggest 
more than one theory of population diffusion. From 
this and archeological evidence, some believe there 
was a migration into the southwest area of the 
North American continent that then spread out to 
populate other areas of both North and South 
America. Others believe there was a general 
spread east, southeast, and south from the Bering 
Strait. 

There are other theories on the origins of the 
Indians. These have not acquired the kind of 
scientific evidence which supports the Siberian- 
Alaskan land bridge theory. It should be noted that 
many American Indian tribes have their own 
concepts and stories about the beginning of their 
people. These traditional accounts of origin very 



often coincide with the physical evidence. They are 
all due the respect and solemnity of any religious or 
cultural belief. 

When the Native Americans journeyed across 
the land, the old groups separated and new ones 
were formed. Some families or clans stopped In 
one place, some In another, and some who 
stopped and settled down to stay right where they 
were. As the original units began to speak more 
and more its own way. Some spoke quite 
differently from others to begin with, but groups 
which had understood one another initially, 
gradually became more separated In speech. 
Some continued to speak with slight differences, so 
they could understand what new acquaintances 
said. Time and isolation increased differences In 
speech that were there in the beginning, and 
eventually a time came when it was hard to tell 
whether certain Indian languages were related to 
one another or not.

II. A BRIEF SURVEY OF INDIAN CULTURES IN 
NORTH AMERICA 

Virtual isolation after the Ice Age promoted the 
evolution of a unique Native American race and 
culture. Throughout South, Central, and North 
America, there are archaeological remnants of 
many advanced civilizations, as well as those 
encountered here by the first European explorers to 
this hemisphere. By 1492 there was a variety of 
distinct cultural areas. 

The Northwest Coast, stretching along the 
coastline from southern Alaska to northern 
California, is the home of one group. Here the 
main industry was fishing for salmon and whales. 
Bountiful natural resources allowed great leisure for 
the development of highly refined art forms and 
elaborate societies. 

From British Columbia down to the Baja 
Peninsula, there were numerous cultural groups 
with many similarities. They are noted for their 
pacificism and exquisite basketry. They wore little 
clothing and were housed In simple grass homes. 
They existed by fishing and hunting small game 
and gathering a wide variety of their bountiful 



plants. A main source of food in some areas was 
the acorn. 

The Southwest includes southern Utah, 
Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, and northern 
Mexico. These were apparently the first North 
Americans to farm. Farming began in Mexico and 
spread north. They irrigated fields and many lived 
in the fortress, apartment-like dwellings, now called 
pueblos. Pottery making became a part of their 
advancement. Many tribes of this area are noted 
for their extremely fine basketry, and the Spanish 
influences encouraged the development of weaving 
and silversmithing. Fine textiles - rugs, blankets, 
and garments - along with the southwest style 
sterling and turquoise jewelry, has brought prestige 
to these people. 

The Inter-mountain or Great Basin region 
includes most of Nevada and the plateau of 
Washington, Oregon, Idaho and parts of Canada. 
The basin area was very barren. Groups In this 
area often lived at a subsistence level, affording 
little time for the development of extensive arts and 



ERLC 



150 

162 



crafts. Toward the plateau to the north there were 
broad inter-triba relations and the development of 
cultures very slmlar to that of the Plains. 

The Plains extended from central Canada 
through the middle of the United States into Texas. 
They served as a great "hallway - for many tribes 



that crossed it. Some settled permanently on the 
Plains. The ^Introduction of the horse to North 
America (a pre-hlstorlc horse once roamed hare) by 
the Spanish, brought radical change. The 
movement of people on horseback In pursuit of the 
buffalo developed a lifestyle and culture which has 




ERLC

151 163 



become one of the stereotypes of Indian people. 
These were the people of the tipi, feather bonnets, 
buckskins, and beads; the Sioux, Cheyenne, Crow 
and Blackfeet of the Northern Plains, and the 
Pawnee, Kiowa and Comanche of the Southern 
Plains. They relied primarily upon the buffalo from 
which they secured almost all their needs. Food, 
fuel, clothing, homes, tools, and utensils were 
produced from the buffalo. 

The Woodland tribes are generally divided into 
three main areas: Northeast Woodlands, Great 
Lakes, and Southeast Woodlands. Many of the 
marginal Prairie groups are included as Woodland 
people, since they are culturally, linguistically, and 
even tribady related to specific Woodland groups. 
From Florida to Quebec and west to the 
Mississippi River Basin, these people were primarily 
farmers and hunters. They raised seasonal crops 
of maize, melons, beans, squash, and pumpkin; 
and harvested hundreds of wild plants such as wild 
rice, tubers of water lily, wild onions, nuts, berries, 
choke cherries, edible parts of cattail, wild turnips 
maple sugar, and wild plums. Hunting, trapping, 
and fishing provided a wide variety of meats; 
including squirrel, muskrat, deer, rabbit, bear, 
turkey, ducks and geese, and a variety of fresh 
and salt water fish. They dried and stored fruits 
and vegetables. 

These Woodland groups drew from the vast 
natural resources at hand to produce a proliferation 
of arts, crafts, and mundane articles. The profound 
effect of trade goods on both material production 
and politics is possibly more apparent there than 



anywhere else in the country. Trade materials of 
the white man, such as glass beads, yarn goods, 
and yarn brought the development of entirely new 
technologies in production, as well as new art 
forms. The Indian traded fur to the white men. 
This demand for furs in Europe and trade materials 
in America had far-reaching repercussions on 
Indian people. Firearms were an Important 
commodity demanded by the Indian people. The 
balance of power shifted among tribal groups, 
depending primarily upon which group had secured 
superior weaponry. 

The events in history from 1492 to the present, 
the politics, economics, colonization, Indian wars, 
and tribal removals had far-reaching effects. Few 
would disagree that the history of Oklahoma 
reflects some of the most profound results to come 
from these events. Indian people, from every 
cultural area in what was to become the United 
States were removed from their native lands and 
relocated in Oklahoma. Some eventually returned 
to their native lands, but most remained in their 
assigned territory.

III. THE INDIANS OF OKLAHOMA - 
BACKGROUND 



A. Prehistoric Tribes 

There is abundant evidence to prove that 
certain parts of Oklahoma were inhabited by people 
of the Indian race long before the discovery of 
America by Columbus. The traces of their former 
presence and the relics and remains of their simple 
arts and industries may be found in many parts of 
the state. It is altogether probable that there were 
several distinct stocks or tribes. 

The Earth-House People 

The prehistoric stock which was by far the 
most numerous, if the conclusion is to be reached 
by ruins and remains which give evidence of its 



activities, was one which during a period of many 
generations' duration inhabited the region now 
embraced by over twenty counties in the eastern 
and southeastern parts of the state, as well as the 
entire state of Arkansas and parts of several other 
adjacent states. The implements and utensils of 
these people indicate that they were well advanced 
in the scale of civilization. They especially excelled 
in the art of making pottery. They dwelt In strongly 
built, timber-framed, dome-shaped houses, which 
were covered with sod or turf. When the 
supporting poles and posts of one of these houses 
became so far decayed as to render it unsafe, it 
was abandoned and another house of the same 
general character was built, usually within 
convenient distance. When such a structure finally 



ERLC 



152 



164 



collapsed, the heavy layer of earth with which its 
walls and roof were covered naturally fell in the 
form of a low, circular mound. These mounds still 
remain to this day in numbers so vast as to cast 
serious doubt in the minds of many as to the 
possibility of their being of human origin. Evidence 
as to this is conclusive. The wide distribution and 
common occurrence of these earth house mounds 
affords abundant opportunity for archaeological 
investigation and exploration. 

Cave and Ledge People 

A prehistoric stock entirely distinct from that 
whose monuments remain in the form of the prairie 
mounds was a tribe of people who made their 
homes or abodes under the shelter of projecting 
rock ledges and in the open mouths of caves. The 
people of this stock lived in a more restricted area 
in the northeastern part of the state, although 
further Investigation may result in showing a more 
extensive habitat. They v, _,re not numerous, and it 
is probable that they lived almost exclusively by 
hunting and fishing. These facts are abundantly 
evidenced by the kitchen refuse, such as bones 
broken to extract the marrow and the shells of 
several species of bivalves, and also by their 
implements, utensils and weapons. 

The Mound Builders 

In the valleys of the Red, Arkansas, Grand, 
Illinois Rivers, and other Oklahoma rivers, there are 
large mounds similar to those found in the valleys 
of the Ohio, Mississippi, and Missouri Rivers, and it 
seems not improbable that they were built by the 
same race of prehistoric people. These mounds 
are in various forms, some being conical, some 
pyramidal, both being truncated more often than 
complete. The several pyramidal mounds thus far 
described, both rectangular and square, were 
apparently built with due regard for cardinal points. 
It is probable that they are more ancient than the 
earth-house mounds, which generally abound in 
the same localities. Whether they are exceeded 
in antiquity by the remains of human occupancy in 
the caves and under the ledges has not been 
ascertained. 

Other Prehistoric Peoples 

Evidences of prehistoric life and activity are far 
less numerous in the central and western parts of 
the state, although It is possible that future 



developments in this line may result in bringing to 
light much more than has been suspected. A flint 
arrow-tip was taken from a sand pit, six feet 
beneath the surface of the ground in the Valley of 
the Deep Fork of the Canadian, near Oklahoma 
City. A granite metate, or mealing stone was 
excavated from a depth nearly as great on a hillside 
near Colony, in Washita County. In neither of these 
Instances was the overlying layer of soil of such a 
character as to indicate that it could have been 
readily disturbed or transported by the action of 
wind or water, so it seems evident that they are 
relics of a very ancient life. Throughout the western 
part of the state, flint implements and other remains 
of prehistoric life may be most commonly found in 
the immediate vicinity of springs of water, which 
quite naturally afforded the most convenient villages 
and camp sites. 

B. Surviving Indigenous Tribes 

Although a number of Indian tribes which are 
still in existence may be classed as having been 
indigenous to Oklahoma, most of them ranged far 
over the borders of neighboring states from time to 
time. In the prehistoric period, as well as in more 
recent times, Indian tribes were wont to change 
their habitats, usually because of pressure of 
superior force on the part of some other tribe, and 
at times there were other impelling motives such as 
practical economics involving the need to follow the 
hunt or the need for a band to sub-divide when It 
became too large to be an economically efficient 
unit. 

The Caddoan Tribes 

The Caddo tribe, which now represents a 
consolidation of several closely related subtribes or 
bands, originally inhabited the valleys of the Sabine 
and Red Rivers, in Texas and Louisiana, and 
extending northward into the southeastern confines 
of Oklahoma. In the region above this tribe, along 
the Valley of the Red River, was the Keechl Tribe, 
although its range extended southward to the 
Valley of the Trinity River In Texas. Still farther west 
in the vicinity of the Wichita Mountains and in the 
Valley of the Upper Red River and those of its 
principal tributaries lived the Wichita and kindred 
tribes, the Waco and TowakonL The people of 
these tribes were always more or less sedentary In 
their habits, living in fixed villages and depending 
upon the cultivation of the soil for a large part of 
their sustenance. 



153 165 



The Siouan Tribes 

The Osage and Quapaw tribes are closely 
related, their language being the same with slight 
variations. As a part of the Great Sioux or Dakota 
stock, their ancestors migrated from the East and 
it is believed that they arrived in the Trans- 
Mississippi country about 600 years ago. The 
Osage lived in Missouri, eastern Kansas, northern 
Arkansas, and northeastern Oklahoma. The 
Quapaw lived south of the Osage, along the Valley 
of the Arkansas and In the eastern part of 
Oklahoma. The Osage retained a distinct tradition 
to the effect that their ancestors had driven out and 
disposed the Caddoan tribes when they came into 
the Arkansas Valley. Both the Osage and Quapaw 
sold their lands in Oklahoma to the government, 
and afterwards each accepted reservations in this 
state. 

The Shoshonean Tribes 

The Comanche were an off-shoot of the 
Shoshone of Wyoming and Idaho, with whom they 
maintained fraternal relations until a comparatively 
recent period. They are supposed to have drifted 
out on the Great Plains about the time of the first 
Spanish explorations and they are known to have 
occupied or over-run the region between the 
Arkansas River and the Lower Rio Grande for at 
least two centuries past. They were a type of the 
nomadic Indian of the Plains, in that they lived 
entirely by the chase and roamed over a vast 
region in search of game and in making war. A 
relatively small area in the Valley of the Upper 
Cimarron, in that part of its course is 
semi mountainous, made it possible for the Ute to 
penetrate farther into the buffalo range in that 
vicinity than elsewhere along the eastern base of 
the Rocky Nountains, while at the same time they 
were in a region whose topography enabled them 
to easily act upon the defensive when attacked by 
their hereditary enemies of the Plains tribes. 

The Kiowa and Plains Apache 

Like the Comanche, the Kiowa were from the 
Rocky Mountains and were living in the region at 
the source of the Missouri River at the beginning of 
the historic period. Thence, they had drifted out on 
the Great Plains in the vicinity of the Black Hills of 
South Dakota. About the time of the American 
Revolution, the Kiowa were driven south of the 
Platte River by the Cheyenne, who in turn were 



giving way before the pressure of superior numbers 
on the part of the Sioux. Within a few years, the 
Kiowa began to range south of the Arkansas River, 
where they came into conflict with the Comanche. 
Eventually, about 1795, they made peace with the 
Comanche and entered into an alliance with them 
which has been maintained ever since; the two 
tribes acting in unison in ail matters of common 
interest, such as the making of war and entering 
into treaties. 

With the Kiowa, who have no known linguistic 
affiliations with any tribe, came a small band of 
Indians of Athapascan stock, who, because they 
spoke a language similar to that of the Apache of 
New Mexico and Arizona, were called the Apache, 
though it is evident that they have been separated 
from any other tribe of that stock for hundreds of 
years. They nave always lived and acted with the 
Kiowa. 

in addition to the foregoing tribes, there were 
probably several others which ranged into 
Oklahoma at rare intervals, but such incursions 
were so infrequent and so brief that the inclusion of 
such bands in the list of indigenous tribes would 
scarcely be warranted. It is worthy of remark, 
however, that all of the indigenous tribes, with one 
exception, are stil! residents of the state. The last of 
the Ute left the Cimarron Valley about the time that 
the big buffalo herds disappeared from that region, 
leaving to join the main body of their tribe in 
southwestern Colorado.

C. Modern Tribes with Indigenous 
Background 

CADDO 

The name Caddo is a derivative of 
Kadohadacho, signifying 'real chiefs ,M who formed 
a confederacy with six subdivisions. Caddoans 
formed another confederacy in southern Oklahoma 
and northern Texas called the Hasinai Confederacy. 

The ancestry of the Caddoans may not be 
scientifically traceable back to the first families of 
the Great Southern Plains, but they had lived there 
for several thousand years when white men first 
encountered them. 

Location : The Caddo settled in southern 




154 



166 



Location : The Caddo settled in southern 
Oklahoma and along the Red River into Arkansas, 
Louisiana, and Texas. 

Background: Caddoan culture reached its 
highest development at the beginning of the 
Christian Era. The specific cause of their decline, 
which began during this period, has not been 
determined. They had severe epidemics and 
experienced devastating losses in warfare with 
other tribes of the Southern Plains. 

Their culture was more advanced and their 
economy more diversified than any other 
prehistoric tribes In this vast region. They were 
both expert hunters and successful agriculturists. 
They lived in towns and some of their communities 
were unusually large. Abundant food supply, 
inherent industriousness, and an ability to absorb 
beneficial practices and new ideas brought them 
prosperity that endured for countless centuries. 

They were among the earliest potters, 
cultivators and weavers of the Great Southern 
Plains. Their cultural patterns reflect that they may 
have originated in Mexico, Circum-Caribbean, 
Mississippi, and southwest of the Pueblos. The 
Caddoan culture extends in several directions. 

The Caddo had a great talent for creating 
organizational systems of political, economical, 
social, and cultural structures that enabled them to 
endure for thousands of years on the Great 
Southern Plains. "Most early writers on tribes of the 
Southwest were favorably impressed by the Caddo, 
describing them as sociable, industrious, intelligent, 
lively, courageous and brave in war, and faithful to 
their word. They were especially known for their 
friendly welcome to visitors, offering the best 
accommodations in their houses and plentiful food. 

In 1846, the Caddo negotiated for lands along 
the Brazos River in Texas and by 1858 had made 
great progress living within the boundaries set by 
this treaty. The aftermath of the wars brought 
hostility of the white men toward Indians. White 
settlers attacked a camp of the Caddo within the 
set boundaries. The result was the removal of the 
Caddo Nation to Indian Territory in 1858. 

"In 1859, the Caddo were moved to the 
Washita River. They were left there impoverished 
and without protection from the surrounding tribes. 
As late as 1860, tribes on the Washita were still 
being threatened by Texans. 

"During the Civil War, the Caddo fought on the 
Confederate side and were one of the last 
Confederate Indian allies to surrender at the end of 
the war. After the war, the Caddo returned to their 
reservation and began to establish their families, 



build homes, and plant crops on the Wichita-Caddo 
Reservation in Oklahoma."

WICHITA 

"A southern confederacy of Caddoan tribes, 
the confederacy also included the Taovayas, 
Tawakoni, Waco, and Kichai." 

Location : The Wichita were located in 
northeastern Kansas, northern Oklahoma, and 
along the Red and Arkansas Rivers." Like the 
Caddo, they had inhabited this area for an 
undetermined period of years before the white men 
encountered them. 

Background : 'The first mention of the Wichita 
tribe by this name in the government records was 
the Camp Holmes Treaty of 1835." The Wichita 
were the only tribe on the Great Plains that 
constructed large dome-shaped, thatched-straw 
shelters, which Coronado described in his 
chronicles as the type of houses the tribe lived in 
on his expedition In Kansas In 1541, which, 
therefore, identified the Wichita in this area at that 
period. "Wichita tradition indicates their migration 
was north to south due to warfare with the 
Comanche, Apache, and Osage." 

They have been described by other tribes and 
explorers as the tribe being tattooed from head to 
foot with many intricate designs. They were 
hunters and agriculturists, the men being the 
protectors, hunters and warriors. The women did 
the farming, built the shelters, and performed 
household duties. "Wichita tools and implements 
were made from bone, stone, some wood, and 
pottery. They had some articles that were woven." 

"By 1850, the Wichita had permanent villages 
in the Wichita Mountain area." "In 1894, the Wichita 
and Caddo tribes were allotted lands in severalty, 
which they held by right of occupancy only."

OSAGE 

The Osage are of the Dhegiha division of the 
Siouan linguistic family, in remote pre-history, they 
were at one time in the Ohio Valley before settling 
on their vast domain within Missouri, Kansas, 
Arkansas, and Oklahoma regions. Their location 
was the major factor for their being virtually 
untouc'iod by the influx of white men, with the 
exception of the French traders and a few Spanish 
traders, until the 1800's. The greatest influence of 
technical change was brought about by trading with 
the French. 

Location : The Osage resided in southern 
Missouri, southeastern Kansas, northwestern 
Arkansas and northern Oklahoma. 

Background : The Osage were divided into two 
groups: the peace people and the war people, with 
groups living in bands, each governed by a chief. 
As a tribe, they had a central governing system 
consisting of a council and two divisional chiefs. At 
the beginning of historic time, they became known 
as the Great Osages and the Little Osages to the 
French traders. In 1673, Marquette placed their 
location on a map, but he did not contact the 
Osage. He was told of their villages by another 
tribe. 

The men were the protectors of the villages, 
hunters and formidable warriors. The women 
planted gardens of corn, pumpkin, squash, and 
beans, and performed other domestic tasks of the 
village life. 

The warriors were aggressive and powerful, 
and were continuously engaging in raids and 



warfare upon tribes of the Plains and east of the 
Mississippi. In the 1700's and 1800's, other tribes 
allied against the Osage. Tribes moving west from 
the southeast were encouraged by officials to join 
tribes to wage war against them. Finally, through 
peace treaties, most animosities were quelled. 

Their permanent villages were on the Osage 
and Missouri Rivers with summer villages near the 
hunting grounds in Kansas and Oklahoma. In 
1 802, there were permanent villages in their domain 
in Oklahoma located on the Arkansas and Verdigris 
Rivers. 

In 1808, the Osage signed a treaty with the 
United States ceding ail their lands west of the 
Mississippi and northeastern Arkansas. They 
moved their villages to their land in Kansas and 
lived there until they were moved to the Osage 
Reservation in Oklahoma. 

H ln 1825, the Osage ceded the northern half of 
Oklahoma to the United States who wanted the 
land for the removal of the eastern tribes. In 1835, 
the Osage, along with seven other tribes, signed a 
treaty at Camp Holmes for peace among Oklahoma 
tribes."

2. Research and study how the natural environment of the various regions affected the lifestyles of tribes. 

a. Students may report on specific tribes within one particular region; i.e., Woodlands, and compare 
the lifestyles of tribes in this region. 

b. Students may report on specific tribes from several recions; i.e., Plains, Southwest, and 
Woodlands, and contrast the lifestyles of tribes from these different regions. 



UNIT TWO 



TRIBAL EXPERIENCES WITH THE EXPLORERS 



I. DISCOVERIES IN OKLAHOMA, B.C. 

Archaeologists have uncovered definite 
evidence of people who lived in Oklahoma long 
ago. New evidence finds European and African 
influences in the Oklahoma area as far back as 800 
B.C. 

Notable finds have been made of ancient 
inscriptions left by Libyans, Celts, and Phoenicians 
who ascended the Mississippi, Arkansas, and 
Cimarron rivers. 

The coming of the Libyan explorers and 
colonists brought to the American scene North 
African cultural aspects. The North African 
voyagers began to explore the New World 
between 1000-800 B.C. Inscriptions found in North 
America reflect that Libyan mariners explored and 
colonized various regions and influenced tribal 
groups whom they came in contact. 

The cultural heritage of the American Indian 



people is reflected in the complex linguistic 
relationships of tho spoken languages today. The 
earliest languages came from Asia, via the west 
coast, and there has been a continuing input of 
Asiatic words from the Pacific as repeated 
incursions have taken place. On the Atlantic side, 
ancient Libyan, Egyptian, Phoenician, Celtic, and 
Basque colonists brought dialects of which some 
descendant tongues can still be recognized. 

Within Oklahoma a wealth of archaeological 
discoveries indicate many early explorations 
occurred centuries Before Christ. These findings 
cast more light on the earlier historical life of man.

II. SPANISH EXPLORATIONS 



A. Spanish Influences In Oklahoma 

In October of 1492 Christopher Columbus, with 
the blessings of King Ferdinand and Queen 
Isabella, set sail for the Orient. He discovered the 
West Indies by landing at San Salvador. After four 
years of exploration Columbus established Spanish 
outposts at both Cuba and Haiti. 

Hearing fantastic tales of great golden cities 
and wealth inland from the Arawak natives, but 
finding none, Columbus was sent back to Spain 
discouraged and disheartened. Ferdinand of 
Aragon died in January of 1516 and was 
succeeded by Charles V who was interested in the 
stories of wealth from the West. In 1519, he 
granted the Governor of Cuba, Velasquez, 
permission to send one of his officers to lead an 
expedition inland. His name was Hernando Cortez. 

Cortez had assisted Velasquez in conquering 
Cuba and had won recognition as a daring soldier 
and wise leader. The restless Cortez led several 
expeditions to explore this region. In one 
expedition, Cortez landed at Veracruz, Mexico 
where he came in contact with the Aztec Indians. 
After a short period of time the Aztec Nation was 
ravaged and destroyed and Cortez was removed 



from power. 

The king appointed Antonio Mendoza, a close 
personal friend, to be the first Viceroy of Mexico. 
Mendoza, upon reaching Mexico, divided it into 
several provinces. Each province had a governor. 
In the most northern of these provinces, New 
Galica, Francisco Vasquez de Coronado was made 
Governor. It was here that Coronado heard of a 
vast unknown region of plain desert and high 
mountains occupied by people with incredible 
wealth of gold and silver. 

On February 23, 1540, Francisco Vasquez de 
Coronado began an expedition that resulted in 
early European acquaintance with Oklahoma. He 
marched his army northward from the Mexican 
town, Compostela, to search for gold. His force 
consisted of about thirteen hundred men; but at 
Culiacan he selected eighty horsemen and twenty- 
five foot soldiers for the march across the rough, 
arid district to the north. With Friar Marcos as 
guide, the party reached Cibola in seventy-three 
days. The Spaniards captured the first of the fabled 
"Seven Golden Cities of Cibola" on July 7, 1540. 
Cibola was six hundred miles west of the site where 
Oklahoma City now stands, and four thousand 
miles southwest of Grand Mesa. 



ERLC 



T74 



The Spanish invaders found no gold, silver or 
precious metal of Cibola, but they did find the 
Pueblo Indians. The Pueblos were a peaceful 
people who lived in adobe and stone houses; in 
some cases these were four stories high. 
Coronado, having seized their food and some of 
their homes, faced hard fighting with the Indians, 
but the Pueblos were no match for the steel-clad 
Spaniards. 

The Spaniards moved on to a city located near 
the Rio Grande called Tiguex. It was here that 
Coronado heard rumors about Quivira, a city of 
gold and silver. With a new Indian guide, 
Coronado led his men south into Texas looking for 
Quivira. He crossed flat plains and desert seeing 
nothing but a few Indians, probably Comanche or 
Apache. 

After thirty-seven days of marching, Coronado 
and his men found that they were going in the 
wrong direction. They turned north and marched 
forty-two days through Oklahoma into Kansas 
reaching Quivira near the Arkansas River. There 
they found the Quivira Indians (Wichita) living in 
their conical grass houses, cultivating gardens and 
hunting buffalo. Coronado found no gold and 
returned to Mexico in the summer of 1542. 



The next journey north from Mexico came in 
1598 when Juan de Onate led a colony to New 
Mexico on the Rio Grande. A few years later Santa 
Fe was founded, and made capital of the province 
of New Mexico. 

At the same time of Coronado's Journey,, 
another Spanish leader was exploring the 
northeastern section of Oklahoma. This was 
Hernando De Soto who made his journey in 1539. 

Both De Soto and Coronado were disappointed 
in finding neither riches nor great cities. However, 
these two men gave Spain a claim to the valley of 
the Mississippi River of which Oklahoma is a part.

B. Spanish Claims In The United States 

For more than two hundred years after the 
voyages of Christopher Columbus to America, 
Spain was engaged in the conquest of new lands 
and the consolidation of her claims. With the rise 
of English sea power and the growth of privateering 
during the second half of the sixteenth century, 
Spain's profits In the New World were threatened. 
French colonial enterprise early in the seventeenth 
century established another rival of Spain, 
particularly In the Mississippi Valley and on the 
northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico. 



Great military expeditions under Francisco 
Vasquez de Coronado, Hernando DeSoto, Juan de 
Onate, and other Spanish conquerors led to claims 
upon vast areas north of Mexico and the Gulf. In a 
large portion of the North American continent the 
claims of Spain, France, and England overlapped. 
Spain at various times asserted a strong claim to 
the western coast all the way north to Alaska, to the 
Mississippi Basin, and to the entire Gulf Coast. She 
held Florida against all rivals until 1819 - with the 
exception of twenty years - and In the treaties of 
1763 was recognized by France and England as 
the owner of Louisiana, west of the Mississippi.

III. FRENCH EXPLORATIONS 

A. French Influences in Oklahoma 

The French came to America because of the 
excellent fishing waters off the coast of New 
Foundland and with the hope of developing a 
profitable fur trade. 

In 1 534, Jacques Cartier explored New 
Foundland and discovered the St. Lawrence River. 
Because of Career's favorable comments of the 
quality of the land and the possible profit from furs, 
Samuel de Champlain was sent to follow up on the 
explorations. In 1609, Champlain built a fort and 
town on a lofty hill overlooking the St. Lawrence 
River. He named this town Quebec. 

Later in 1673 Louis Joitet, a soldier, and Father 
Marquette, a Jesuit Priest, wore sent on a mission 
to explore a great river known to the Indians as the 
"Mesabi River.* Marquette and Joliet found the 
great Mississippi and floated down it for days. 
They found strange birds, animals and came in 
contact with a few Indians. Due to the fear of 



finding Spaniards, Joiiet and Marquette decided to 
turn back. 

Robert de La Salle in 1682 decided to complete 
the journey started by Joliet, He and his men 
travelled the complete length of the Mississippi 
reaching the Gulf of Mexico. La Salle called this 
land Louisiana in honor of Louis XIV. 

The first French explorer to enter present day 
Oklahoma was Bernard de la Harpe. Acting under 
the directions of colonial authority he led an 
expedition through Oklahoma. In 1718, La Harpe 
received a grant of land above Natchitoches on the 
Red River for the purpose of opening trade with 
Indians of that region. He travelled through eastern 
Oklahoma and western Arkansas, making careful 
observations of the valleys of the Red, Ouachita. 
Arkansas, Grand, and Canadian rivers. In his 
journal La Harpe mentioned a visit to lead mines 
north of the Arkansas River and gave an account of 
Indian trade in metals with Spaniards. 

Hundreds of French coureurs do bois came 

177 



upstream to Oklahoma in search of peltries. Many 
of these men were illiterate, and meager records of 
sales are the chief historical accounts of their 
activities. They brought few French wives into the 
wilderness, and their marriages to Indian mates 
generally followed native customs. Second- 
generation woods-rangers were likely to regard 
themselves as Indians rather than Frenchmen and 
to make use of the tribal language of their mothers. 
French names for streams, mountains, and villages 
came Into use, however, as a natural result of the 
trade In French goods. By 1759, many Indians 
along the Red River were well equipped with 
French guns and ammunition. The French 
governor of Louisiana, Kerleric, regarded the 
Caddoan and other tribes of the area as subjects of 
France. 



Gradually records emerged and were 
assembled. It Is known that French traders had 
some acquaintance with the Caddoans before 1 700 
and that a lively trade was begun with the Wichita 
villages through La Harpe's efforts In 1719, and that 
the Twin Villages - on the Red River were given the 
names San Bernardo and San Teodoro by 
Athanase de Mezieres In 1778. This Louisiana 
Frenchman was regarded as the "foremost Indian 
agent and diplomat of the Louisiana-Texas frontier," 
who became a subject of Spain with the transfer of 
Louisiana Territory to that nation. 

Ferdinandlna was a trading post west of the 
Arkansas River In what Is now Kay County, 
Oklahoma, near the site of the Chilocco Indian 
School. This place was regarded by Joseph 
Thobum as the "first white settlement in Oklahoma".

- though he attached littie significance to the term, 
probably because he understood thoroughly the 
mixed character of the population in trading posts 
frequented by the courers de bois. 

The Chouteau brothers of St. Louis, Missouri 
had the privilege of trading rights with the Osage 
Indians. Due to constant Spanish interference by 
Manual Lisa, a Creole Spaniard, Pierre Chouteau 
convinced the Osage to move out of Missouri into 
Oklahoma. In Oklahoma the Osage settled near 
the Neosho (or Grand) and the Verdigris rivers. 



With the Osage separated from Spanish 
Influence, Pierre Chouteau established a trading 
post near the vicinity of the Arkansas River In 1802. 
It continued to be occupied and operated by the 
Chouteau family until the Osage withdrew from that 
part of the country and the Cherokee took their 
place. 

The most conclusive evidence as to the 
thoroughness with which the greater part of 
Oklahoma was visited and explored by the French 
is to be found in the names of towns, rivers, creeks,

mountains and hHis throughout Oklahoma. The 
names o? Point de Sucre (Sugarloaf), Cavaniol (or 
Cavaral) and the San Bois Mountains are plainly of 
French origin, as are those of the Poteau, Illinois, 
Canadian, Grand, Verdigris, Grand Saline (Salt Fork 
of Arkansas) and Faux Ouachita (Washita) rivers. 

Several French geographical names have been 
corrupted with the course of time. For instance, 
the Osage called a stream in the north central part 
of the state Ne-Scua-Tonga, which literally means 
"River Salt Big." The first French explorers named 
it Grand Saline and later the Americans called it the 
Salt Fork.

B. French Claims In The United States 

France, like England, started late in the 
exploration of the new lands of the Western 
Hemisphere. The first permanent French settlement 
in North America was in Quebec In 1609, which 
was contemporary with English beginnings in 
Virginia in 1607-19. A remarkable group of 
explorers sent out by Henry IV, Louis XIII, and 
Louis XVI elevated colonial France to a position of 
rivalry with the British. In the great armed conflicts 
over possession of America north of the Gulf of 
Mexico and the Rio Grande, the basic struggle was 
between France and England. Between 1689 and 
1763, colonial wars recessed only for the recovery 
of strength and regrouping of allies. 

England's claims, based chiefly upon 
exploration of the Atlantic coast and rising national 
confidence in sea power, were set down in charters 
to commercial companies. Vast stretches of 
unexplored territory all the way from the Atlantic to 
the Pacific were covered by these charters. 

French claims were based upon the 
explorations and settlements of pioneers: Samuel 
de Champlain and Sieur de Monts, founders of 
Quebec, and their successors.

IV. AMERICAN EXPLORERS 1806- 1821 



Earliest of tne major explorers in Oklahoma 
under the authonty of the United States was 
Lieutenant James B. Wilkinson in 1806. The party 
left St. Louis under the command of Lieutenant 
Zebuion Pike, traveling up the Missouri and Osage 
Rivers and northwest into Kansas. From Pawnee 
Village they turned west to the Great Bend of the 
Arkansas. 

Ueutenant Wilkinson began the descent of the 
stream in October with five soldiers. By making 
side trips, he visited the sites of Pawhuska and 
Claremore, but each time returned to the Arkansas 
and on December 29 he reached the site of 
Webber Fails. Lieutenant Wilkinson completed the 
descent of the Arkansas and continued to New 
Orleans with the journal of his expedition. 

In 181 1, Colonel George Sibley, Indian agent in 
Missouri, returned a party of Osages to the Platte 
River and headed south, crossing the Arkansas in 
Kansas. He explored the upper Chikaskia and 
followed the Salt Fork of the Arkansas River 
southward into northern Oklahoma that became 
known as the Great Salt Plains. 



Major Stephen H. Long, in his search for a 
suitable place for a fort on the Arkansas River in 
1817, explored the Kiamichi Valley. His route from 
Arkopdis (site of Little Rock) extended through the 
site of Hot Springs, across the upper Missouri Fork 
and to the mouth of the Kiamichi. From that point 
on the Red River he followed the Kiamichi and 
Poteau Rivers and to Belle Point on the Arkansas, 
which became the location of Fort Smith. Major 
Long named the place for his commander, General 
Thomas A, Smith. 

The Thomas Nuttali expedition reached 
Oklahoma by way of the Arkansas River In April, 
181 a Nuttali, a botanist, traveled south with Major 
William Bradford and a party of soldiers from Fort 
Smith. His journal describes the streams and 
mountains of southeastern Oklahoma. After his 
return to Fort Smith, Nuttali explored along the 
Arkansas, Grand, Verdigris, Canadian, North 
Canadian, Deep Fork, and Cimarron rivers. His 
record, filled with details of river travel and descrip- 
tions of Indian bands, has unique value for students 
of history and geography.

The great Long-Bell expedition to the Rocky 
Mountains started at Pittsburgh under Major 
Stephen H. Long on May 5, 1819. Their route took 
them down the Ohio, north to the Missouri and up 



that stream to the Platte, westward to the Rocky 
Mountains, and southward toward Pikes Peak. 
Captain Bell returned along the Arkansas, but 
Major Long continued south to the headwaters of

the Canadian - which he supposed to be the Red 
Riven 

The botanist, Edwin James, left a detailed 
report of the expedition down the Canadian, 
through the Texas panhandle and Oklahoma. 
Major Long realized that he was not on the Red 
River when he reached the Arkansas on September 
10, 1820. Captain Bell's party rejoined Major Long 
at Fort Smith. 

In May, 1821, Thomas James traveled with 
John McKnight on a journey to New Mexico. After 
leaving the Cimarron, the party crossed the North 
Canadian in western Oklahoma and reached Santa 



Fe in December, 1821. 

The Hugh Glenn-Jacob Fowier expedition of 
1821 was a trading enterprise. The party of twenty 
men left Fort Smith on September 6, made brief 
stops at Bean and Saunders' salt works on the 
Illinois River, Colonel Glenn's trading post on the 
Verdigris, and Chief Clermont's Osage Village. 
West of the Arkansas River the traders began to 
exchange goods with Kiowa, Cheyenne, and 
Arapaho. At Taos, with trade goods exhausted and 
pack animals loaded with pelts, the party turned 
back. 



V. AMERICAN EXPl ?HERS 1832 - 1853 

The Washington Irving expedition through 
Oklahoma in 1832 included Henry Ellsworth of the 
Stokes Commission and Charles J. Latrobe, author 
of The Rambler in North America. Accompanied by 
Captain Bena's Rangers, the party covered parts of 
the Arkansas, Cimarron, and North Canadian 
valleys, all of which had been traversed previously. 
No person, however, had described the region and 
its inhabitants in detail and with such iively, 
charming narrative as Irving did. 



The Dragoon Expedition of 1834 under General 
Henry Leavenworth was a major effort to establish 
peace on the Southern Plains. Five hundred 
dragoons under Colonel Henry Dodge, with 
additional Indian scouts and interpreters and two 
infantry companies from Fort Towson, made up the 
party. George Catlin, the distinguished painter of 
Indian life, was permitted to ride along with them. 

The dragoons marched towards Edwards' Post 
on June 15, established Camp Holmes, crossed the

Canadian River, and reached the lower Washita on 
July 4. Beyond the Washita, General Leavenworth 
died in a hospital camp. Colonel Dodge marched 
the dragoons west to Old Comanche Village and to 
Toyash Village on the North Fork of the Red. From 
the', point he returned to Fort Gibson, reaching the 
post on August 15. 

Josiah Gregg, one of the great Santa Fe 
traders, began his expedition of 1839 at Van Buren, 
Arkansas. Goods for New Mexico were carried in 
fourteen wagons. Gregg traveled on the north side 
of the Canadian beyond Camp Mason, crossed that 
stream between the sites of Bridgeport and Taloga, 
and continued west to Santa Fe and south to 
Chihuahua. He returned in 1840, traveling 2000 
miles with 28 wagons and a large flock of sheep 
and goats. 



Captain Nathan Boone of Missouri led an 
expedition from Fort Gibson to the Great Salt Plains 
in 1843. The route was along the Arkansas River to 
the site of Osage, northwest to Salt Fork, and north 
of the 37th parallel. Returning, Boone crossed the 
Cimarron, marched south to the Canadian, and 
followed that stream to North Fork Town. 

In 1849 a band of California emigrants was 
escorted through Oklahoma by Captain R. B. 
Marcy. Four years later Marcy explored a part of 
southwestern Oklahoma in his search for the 
headwaters of the Red River.

UNIT THREE 



TRIBAL NATIONS: PLAINS AND FIVE CIVILIZED TRIBES 



I. PLAINS TRIBES - AN OVERVIEW 



A. The Great Plains was peopled by a large 
number of tribes whose culture was 
severely threatened and changed in the 
nineteenth century because of the 
westward expansion of the Anglo- 
Americans. The resulting conflicts were 
often Woody, as earlier ideas of keeping 
the Anglos and Indians separated from 
each other -vanished. Anglo-Americans 
continued to insist that the Plains could 



and would be inhabited by the white man. 
Because of their superior number and 
technology, the white man prevailed, and the 
ultimate result was a disappointing end to the 
traditional life and culture of a proud people. 
Their lives, however, continue to be enriched 
by a great heritage. This is chronicled in 
excellent fashion in Chapter X of The Southern 
Plains Tribes: A Study of History and Culture 
by Dick Swift. 



B. There are three regions of the Plains: 



1. Northern Plains 

2. Middle Plains 

3. Southern Plains

II. SURVEY OF SEVERAL PLAINS TRIBES 
QUAPAW 

The Quapaw belong to the Siouan linguistic 
family. Other tribes related closely to the Quapaw 
are the Osage, Kansa (Kaw), Ponca, and Omaha. 
These tribes all separated in pre-historical time. 

Location : Their earliest known homeland was 
on the Ohio River. They migrated south to the 
Mississippi River and the lower Arkansas River. 
Southern Oklahoma was claimed by the Quapaw 
and ceded to the United States in 1818. 

Background : The Quapaw were hunters, 
gatherers, and farmers. They made earthen 
pottery, used for cooking and as plates, and wove 
large cane baskets for storage. They were a 
people with a peaceful and liberal disposition. The 
villages were built on high earth mounds, and 
constructed of dome-shaped, bark-roof covered 
shelters which housed several families.... An 
interesting fact about the Quapaw, after their 
removal from Arkansas to the Oklahoma reservation 
in 1887, occurred when their land was being 
allotted by a government bureau. They became 
dissatisfied over the delays and decided to take 
control and direct their own allotment, the first time 
a tribe had done this."

PAWNEE 

The Pawnee are of the Caddoan linguistic 
family. Elements of the Pawnee's language, 
customs, and tradition can be traced to the 
Southeast and Southwest. Traditional history 
located the Pawnee in southern Oklahoma 
migrating north until they settled on the Platte River 
in Nebraska from pre-historic time until their 
removal in 1800 l s. 

Location : The Pawnee resided on the Platte 
River in Nebraska and in northern Kansas. 

Background : The Pawnee had developed a 
very complex religious system and highly organized 
social and political systems. They lived in earth 
lodges and were hunters, food gatherers, and 
agriculturists. M The origin of the name, Pawnee, is 
uncertain. 

In the middle of the I7th century, the Pawnee 
were being savagely raided by tribes to the east 
that had acquired weapons from the French. A 
great number of Pawnee were captured by other 
tribes and sold into slavery to traders. Tribes to the 
west and south of them sold them into slavery to 
the Spanish. 

The use of the horse made an immense 
change in their lifestyle, and by 1630, they had 
acquired a large number of horses. French traders 
were established among the Pawnee before 1750. 
The trade goods and diseases brought to the 
Pawnee influenced their lives and the number of 
tribal members. A tribe acquired power and 
prestige by the strength of a large tribe. 

M ln the treaties with the United States of 1833, 
1848, and 1857, the Pawnee ceded all their lands, 
with the exception of land set aside for a 
reservation in Nebraska. They stayed there until

KIOWA 

The Kiowa have been linguistically linked with 
both the Tanoan and the Shoshonean stocks; 
previously, they had been considered a separate 
linguistic family. It is uncertain as to what regions 
they called their homeland before being located in 
the Black Hills as late as 1780. They started 
migrating south until settling in the Wichita 
Mountains of Oklahoma. 

Location : The Kiowa were located in western 
Montana until 1780, and at one time in the Black 
Hills of South Dakota. 

Background The Kiowa came to the Great 
Southern Plains from the north. Their migration 
was hastened by the aid of the horse. It has been 
said that they had developed great horsemanship 
and quickly adapted the use of the horse to their 
nomadic ways. Before they left the north, the 
Kiowa and Kiowa-Apache are assumed to have 
joined forces. The specific date of this association 
is unknown. It is generally accepted that since the 
Kicwa were large numerically as compared to the 
Kiowa-Apache, the Kiowa-Apache joined them for 
protection. 

Kiowa tradition and the anthropologists are not 
in agreement as to their origin, nor have the 
physical descriptions of the Kiowa, written by the 
white men who first encountered them, been in 
accord. 

'Throughout early history, they were noted to 
be very powerful and fierce warriors on the plains, 
traveling great distances on raiding parties, or to 
make war on other tribes. They were well 
organized politically, socially, economically, and 
culturally. The tribe was made up of six divisions 
when they moved south and east into the Plains." 
They lived in tipis and depended on the success of 
the hunting parties and food gatherers for food, 
clothing, implements, and shelter. This caused 
great value to be placed on the horse. The Kiowa 
fought many wars on the plains with Comanche, 
Caddo, Wichita, Osage, Pawnee, Cheyenne, and 
Arapaho. Later, they began peaceful negotiations 



with several of these tribes in the early 1800s. 

The Kiowa had established friendly 
relationships with the Comanche, Wichita, 
Cheyenne, and Arapaho tribes. The Kiowa, 
sometimes joined by other allies, made raids Into 
Texas and New Mexico. The United States, 
pressured by settlers In these areas, sent the U. S. 
Army to the area for protection from these tribes. 
Several forts were built: Fort Atkinson, Fort Sill, Fort 
Supply and others as the opening against hostile 
Indians of the Southern Plains commenced. 

The first treaty the Kiowa made with the United 
States In 1837 established peace with the Osage 
and Creek for equal hunting rights, and the United 
States citizens were allowed access through the 
Plains region. 

In 1853, the Kiowa, Comanche, and 
Kiowa-Apache signed a treaty with the United 
States at Fort Atkinson, Kansas. The treaty 
established peaceful access of travel through this 
region for white people going west. 

In 1865, they signed a treaty that resulted in the 
Kiowa and Comanche settling on a reservation In 
western Texas and in southwestern Oklahoma. 

In 1867, the Kiowa signed the Medicine Lodge 
Treaty which set forth the boundary lines for a 
reservation In Oklahoma."

KIOWA-APACHE 

The Kiowa-Apache are of the Athapascan 
linguistic family, but had no political connection 
with Apache tribes." Although they have always 
retained their identity and spoke the dialect of the 
Athapascan language, their entire history and 
migration on the plains are the same as the Kiowa. 

Location : The Kiowa-Apache resided In 
western Montana until 1780, and at one time in the 
Black Hills of South Dakota. 

Background : The Kiowa-Apache made alliance 
with the Kiowa tribe at an unknown date while both 
tribes lived in the Northern Plains. They 
kept their tribal customs and traditions when they 
migrated with the Kiowa to the Southern Plains. 

The Kiowa-Apache signed their first treaty with 
the United States in 1837, at Fort Gibson, OK. H 

"In 1867, they signed the Medicine Lodge 
Treaty in Kansas."

CHEYENNE 

The Cheyenne belong to the Aigonquian 
linguistic family. The name Cheyenne was given to 
them by the Sioux. "In a later period, they became 
closely associated with the Arapaho. There are two 
divisions of the Cheyenne: Northern Cheyenne and 
Southern Cheyenne. This separation of the tribe 
took place in Colorado." They hunted and raided 
into Kansas and Oklahoma areas. 

Location : "In earlier days the Cheyenne 
resided in North Dakota and the upper Missouri 
River. They lived in Colorado in 1851, located on 
the Arkansas River. M They later moved into 
Oklahoma on the Washita River before 1868. 

Background : The Cheyenne are one of the 
more prominent tribes of the Southern Plains. 
Before arriving on the plains, they lived in 
permanent villages, hunted wild game, and were 
farmers and potters." They are known for their 
expertise in tipi construction and decoration. "As 
they moved further into the plains, it became 
essential to adopt new ways. The Cheyenne were 
a nomadic tribe who came to be known as 
formidable warriors of the Great Plains." 

The first accomplishments their young men 
learned were to be courageous and vigorous 
warriors. The men were dedicated to protecting 
their villages, providing food, and eliminating the 
enemy. 

The Cheyenne were known for their fine 
physical appearance and their colorfully decorated 
clothing." Their political structure was complicated 
and rigid with chiefs forming a council which 
governed the tribe. The Dog Soldiers were 
structured warrior organizations that kept law and 
order. The women participated in hunts; their role 
was to drive animals within range of the hunters. 
These hunting parties were conducted on foot. 

The Cheyenne were recorded in 1680 by La 
Salle when the tribe visited the fort on the Illinois 
River " 

"Modern Cheyenne history began from their 
meeting as recorded by the Lewis and Clark 
Expedition of 1804 in the Black Hills of South 
Dakota." 

"In 1825, the Cheyenne signed their first peace 



treaty with the United States in Montana." 

"Part of the Cheyenne settled on the Arkansas 
River in Colorado and became known as the 
Southern Cheyenne. The division located on the 
Platte and Yellowstone Rivers became known as 
the Northern Cheyenne." 

"In 1861, the Cheyenne and Southern Arapaho 
signed a treaty with the United States at Fort Wise, 
Kansas ceding lands in Nebraska, Kansas, 
Colorado, and Wyoming.... In 1867, they signed 
the Medicine Lodge Treaty providing for their 
reservation in Indian Territory."

ARAPAHO 

â€¢The Arapaho, westernmost tribe of the 
Aigonquian linguistic family, were closely affiliated 
with the Cheyenne." The Arapaho and Cheyenne 
were in Colorado in the 1800's. Both tribes had a 
division. Some of the people went north and others 
went south, becoming the Northern Arapaho and 
Southern Arapaho, like the Cheyenne. Northern 
and Southern Arapaho have kept close association. 

Location : The Southern Arapaho in pre- history 
were located at the Red River of Minnesota; moving 
southward around 1700. Like other Plains tribes, 
they raided as far south as Mexico. They retreated 
to the Great Southern Plains in 1851. 

Background : M At one time the Arapaho were 
called the 'Bison Path People/ and later were 
associated with the Gros Ventre tribe.... They 
separated from the Gros Ventre in the early 1600's, 
becoming known as the Arapaho by the Pawnee. 
Before coming to the plains they were hunters, 
farmers, and gatherers. They later adopted the 
nomadic lifestyle of the Plains tribes." They were 
known as expert hunters and courageous warriors, 
but were also kind with tolerant temperament. They 
lived in tipi villages, governed by a chief and 
military societies. The Sun Dance was their 
important annual religious ceremony with which 
they attached great significance and meaning to 
visions and dreams. 

"In 1861, the Arapaho ceded lands in 
Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, and Wyoming except 
land for a reservation in Colorado." They had made 
peace with most tribes on the plains by this period. 
'The Medicine Lodge Treaty created a new 



175 158 



reservation on the Arkansas River that bordered 
Kansas. This location was unacceptable to the 
tribe, who was later allotted reservation land farther 
south within Indian Territory where they are 
presently located."

COMANCHE 

T h 9 Comanche are of the linguistic family with 
the Shoshone of the Rocky Mountains and the 
Great Basin area. They acquired the name 
Comanche in records and journals after 1700. 
They were referred to by other names by 
surrounding tribes. One of the most recoynized 
was the Padouca, which is believed to have been 
the name of one band of Comanche. They were 
well established on the Middle Plains by the 
1700's. 

Location : The Comanche lived in eastern 
Colorado, western Kansas and New Mexico. 

Background : The Comanche, after acquisition 
of the horse from the Spaniards, became the 
greatest horsemen of the Plains. Combining the 
horse with a nomadic lifestyle, great strength and 
being heavily armed, they created great concern for 
the white man and other tribes of the Plains. 

They were hunters, gatherers, and notorious 
raiders of the Plains, the Southwest, and Texas. 
They raided primarily for horses, especially since 
horses were considered very valuable to their way 
of life." 



'The Comanche moved southward and waged 
war with the Plains tribes for many years. In 1 724, 
DuBourgmont visited a Comanche village in central 
Kansas." 

"About 1790, the Comanche and Kiowa made 
a peace agreement. They became notorious for 
their raids on the settlers in Kansas, Oklahoma, and 
Texas." 

The Comanche signed their first treaty with the 
United States at Camp Holmes on the Canadian 
River in Oklahoma in August, 1835." 

"In I867, they signed the Medicine Lodge Treaty 
which set forth boundaries for their reservation land 
within the Indian Territory." 

"For nearly two centuries they were at war with 
the Spanish and American expeditions, and Indians 
alike. After years of defending their way of life, this 
powerful tribal nation did not submit to the more 
powerful United States until 1875. This occurred 
only after the buffalo had been destroyed, other 
game had vanished, and when the army had 
captured and killed their horses and burned their 
homes." 

The Comanche ruled the Great Plains, Texas 
and the Southwest during the eighteenth and 
nineteenth centuries. They were powerful, 
particularly due to their superior horsemanship, 
their fearlessness in war, raids, and their conquests 
over others. In retrospect, the Comanche have 
been referred to as the notorious "Lords of the 
South Plains."

FIVE CIVILIZED TRIBES - AN OVERVIEW 



A. Five great tribes of Indians from time 
immemorial occupied the land known as 
the Southern States. In earlier days, white 
settlers from the East, coveting this 
beautiful country, began pushing their 
settlements into it. Treaties were 
negotiated from time to time by which the 
whites became established in the country 
of the Indians, who were thus subjected to 
a progressive divesture of their country 
and corresponding limitations of their 
habitable domain. As the movement 
gathered momentum, the resistance of the 
Indians began to take form and 
manifested itself by an intelligent 
demonstration of their rights. This 
unequal conflict of interests resulted in the 



inevitable decision of the Indian Removal Bill 
of 1830. 

These Indians, the Choctaw, Chickasaw, 
Cherokee, Creek and Seminole, through their 
contact with the white settlers and 
missionaries, the struggle to retain their 
homes, and their innate intelligence, had 
acquired the rudiments of the white man's 
culture and were making ama/.ing progress In 
civilized ways when this achievement was 
wrecked by the ruthless expulsion from their 
home during the decade following the year 
1830.

IV. SURVEY OF THE FIVE CIVILIZED TRIBES 

CHEROKEE 

The Cherokee are listed as an Iroquoian 
linguistic family, which indicates that they probably 
lived in the Great Lakes region in pre-history before 
moving to the southeast in the Appalachian 
highlands. 

Location : The Cherokee are from southwest 
Virginia, western North and South Carolina, eastern 
Tennessee, northern Georgia, and northeastern 
Alabama. 

Background : 'The Cherokee were a large tribe 
that was divided into clans with a chief and council 
which was open to ail tribal members. The 
Cherokee taught respect of tribal customs, 
traditions, individual freedom, and did not require a 
strong political structure. 

They were excellent hunters, fishermen, 
traders, and farmers who lived in conical-shaped 
dwellings covered with bark and skin during the 
hunting seasons. Several families lived together in 
white clay, permanent dwellings in villages along 
streams and waterways." The Cherokee made 
baskets which were similar in characteristics of the 
basketweavers of Orinoco and Amazon Basins. 

After the white men came, the Cherokee fought 
for forty years trying to protect their land, and 
finally lost to the overwhelming influx of the white 
mens* numbers and weapons. "During the French 
and Indian Wars of 1756, between France and 
England, the Cherokee allied with the English in the 
beginning. In 1776, the tribe gave up large tracts 
of land.... From 1785-1902 the Cherokee signed 25 
treaties and agreements with the United States 
government, 18 of which provided outright 
concessions of tribal land to the United States." 

"In 1808-09, a small portion of the Cherokee 
tribe was living on the White River, presently called 
the Arkansas River, in Indian Territory." After many 
legislative actions and treaties, negotiations 
climaxed with the Removal Act. The Cherokee 
were moved to Oklahoma. "Final removal began 
May 26, 1838, and more than 4,000 died before 
reaching their destination in the spring of 1839. 
The Cherokee who refused to move to Indian 
Territory were finally granted formal title to the 
Qualla Reservation and other smaller tracts of land 
in North Carolina in 1876."

CREEK 

The Creek, once known as the Muscogee tribe, 
are of the Muskhogean linguistic family, which also 
include the Chickasaw and Choctaw, all of whom 
controlled the southern seuion of the United States 
region. The meaning of the name Muscogee is 
unknown, The first white traders located them 
along the creeks and rivers and referred to them as 
the tribe along the creeks, and they eventually 
became known as the Creek tribe, 

Location : The Creek resided in South Carolina, 
Alabama, and Georgia. 

Background : The Creek were among the last 
people to maintain their temple mounds into later 
historical times. The villages wew constructed 
around a public square; structures were covered 
with grass and plastered with clay inside and out. 
The summer houses were built with wooden sides 
raised aloft on four posts and had floors of cane. 
The Creeks were hunters, gatherers, and farmers. 
Their clothing was made from skins. 

The Creek (Muscogee) created an 
organizational structure of many other tribes who 
affiliated as a league of nations known as the Creek 
Confereracy. It was not a permanent central 
government. The individual townsites had their own 
chiefs who formed a national council that met 
twice, annually. The council entered into policy- 
making which did not find any town or any 
individual who chose to dissent- Harmony in unity 
became their strength, Their tribal organization was 
based on the status system structured on 
achievement first, and heredity second; there were 
no definite social classes. 

The Creek divided into two divisions: the 
Upper Creek and the Lower Creek. M In 1700, other 
tribes weakened by frontier expansion and war 
joined the Creek Confederacy. In 1777, William 
Bartram visited the Creek Nation and located 55 
*owns." 

By the 1700's the Creek had been infiltrated by 
white frontiersmen and their influences had made 
many changes in the lifestyle of the Creek. 

"In the War of 1812, the Creek National Council 
decided to remain neutral." In 1813, Creek war 
parties became involved with settlers on the east 
and to the south which caused a separation within 

192 



the tribe resulting in the inter-tribal Red Stick War. 
The members of the Red Sticks later began 
attacking white settlements over land infringement. 
The government troops under the direction of 
Andrew Jackson conquered the warring Creek. 
Under surrender, they were forced to cede all lands 
In southern Georgia to the United States in 1814. 

The ceding of land was opposed by the 
majority of the tribe, and the Creek National 
Council agreed that no other land be ceded to the 
United States. The law carried a death penalty to 
any offender. In 1825, a head chief, William 
Mcintosh, and other tribal chiefs of the minority 
signed the Indian Springs Treaty ceding tribal lands. 
The National Council stalled negotiations of the 
treaty to offset tribal uprising and carried out the 
death penalty for William Mcintosh." Some of his 
followers were also assassinated. 

In 1826, opposition from the majority of the 
tribe resulted in negotiations against the Indian 
Springs Treaty. They entered into new negotiations 
fcr another treaty, and the outcome was the 
nullification of the Indian Springs Treaty and the 
ceding of lands in Georgia to the United States. 
Mcintosh followers were to be given land west of 
the Mississippi in Indian Territory to be paid by the 
government. 

In 1827, Creek leaders came west to select 
land for this transaction. They chose land between 
the Verdigris and Grand Rivers in northeast Indian 
Territory. 

The first Creeks to come west under the 1826 
treaty were 733 Mcintosh followers. By 1830, there 
were 3,000 Creeks in Indian Territory. They had 
been promised farming supplies and equipment, 
but delays by the government brought about many 
hardships along with warring raids by the Plains 
tribes who inhabited this area, and looked upon 
them as intruders. 

In 1832, Creek leaders signed another treaty 
with the United States and ceded all tribal lands 
east of the Mississippi, which called for the 
immediate possession by the government upon 
removal of tribal members to the west, with the 
stipulation that any tribal members wishing to 
remain would be granted allotted land in Alabama. 
This was only the beginning of problems through 
treaties, negotiations, agreements, settlers' land 
grabbing, and inter-tribal unrest that lasted until the 
late 1800's. M By 1837, there were 15,000 Creeks in 
the vicinity of Fort Gibson, Oklahoma."

CHOCTAW 

The Choctaw are of the Muskhogean linguistic 
family. According to tradition, they came from the 
west to the southeast in pre-history. When white 
men contacted the Choctaw, they had settled in the 
southern region of the United States. 

Location : The Choctaw were located in central 
and southern Mississippi and in southern Alabama. 

Background : The Choctaw were hunters, 
fishermen, gatherers, and agriculturists. They wore 
clothing made from skins, furs, feathers, and bark. 
They lived In log dwellings with bark roofs, in 
settlements divided into three tribal sub-divisions: 
the Okla falaya (western), Okla pannap (eastern), 
and Kunsah (central). 

The Choctaw were by nature probably the 
most peaceful Indians in the Southeast, yet they 
were continually involved in defensive wars. Their 
most persistent attackers were the Chickasaw and 
Creek. The Choctaw were not aggressive, yet they 
were not timid. When war was forced upon them, 
they were capable fighters. 

There were rivalries between the French and 
English over trading with the tribes. The Choctaw 
allied with the French when a series of wars came 
about. In 1736, the English and their allies, the 
Chickasaw, defeated the French and Choctaw. 

"During the American Revolution, the Choctaw 
fought on the American side." After the war, 
treaties were signed with the Choctaw who came 
under the American government which assigned 
them land boundaries and established trade 
relations in 1765. 

Before the 1800*s the western Choctaw people 
living on the border of Louisiana and Arkansas 
found it necessary to send hunting parties into 
Oklahoma because of the scarcity of game in their 
domain. 

After the treaty of 1819 between Spain and the 
United States, the government began to exert 
pressure on the Choctaw to be moved to the west. 
The Choctaw were among the first southeastern 
tribes to be assigned land in Oklahoma in the 
Treaty of 1820. The treaty, signed in September, 
1830, provided for the final removal of the Choctaw 
Nation to Oklahoma. They were the first tribe to be 
moved in mass which occurred between 1831 and 
1834." 

The Choctaw cession of lands (10 million 
acres) to the United States occurred as a result of 



180 



the Treaty of 1830, which included the following 
terms: 

1. The Choctaw Nation of Red People is given all 
jurisdiction and government of all persons and 
property that may be within their limits west, so 
that no Territory or State shall ever have a right 
to pass a law for the government of the 
Choctaw Nation of Red People and their 
descendants; that no part of the land granted 
to them shall ever be embraced in any 
Territory or State. 

2. Congress may consider of, and decide 
application of the Choctaw for a delegate in 
the Congress of the United States. (Congress 
never granted representation.) 

3. Sums to be paid by the United States to the 
tribe in the form of annuities to be used for: (a) 
maintaining the Choctaw government, (b) 
educating Choctaw youths, (c) building a 
National Council House and dwellings for the 
three district chiefs, (d) lands in Mississippi to 
be allotted to Choctaw people who remain, 
and citizenship in Mississippi, and (e) Federal 
investigation of land frauds in Mississippi by 
white people against the Choctaw." 

The Constitution of the Choctaw Nation of 
Oklahoma was written and adopted on June 3, 
1834. They built a temporary council house ana 
established twelve schools for the education of their 
youth in 1838. 

During the Civil War of the United States, the 
Choctaw and Chickasaw signed a treaty with the 
Confederacy to send troops to fight on their side 
against the Union Army. At the end of the war, the 
United States Government made a treaty with the 
Choctaw and Chickasaw, re-establishing the 
Choctaw Nation.

CHICKASAW 

The origin of the Chickasaw name, as well as 
the origin of the tribe, remains unknown. They are 
of the Muskhogean linguistic family and are one of 



the Five Civilized Tribes from southeastern United 
States. 

Location : The Chickasaw were located in 
Mississippi, Tennessee, and parts of Kentucky and 
Alabama. 

Background : The Chickasaw economy was 
based on hunting, fishing, and food gathering. 
They wore clothing made of skins and fur robes of 
bearskin. The dwellings were constructed of two 
types, for use in the winter and summer months. 
The winter house was circular-shaped with an 
earthen floor. A wooden frame was covered with 
poles, and the structure was covered with clay and 
thatched. The roofs were made of cane. The 
summer house was rectangular shaped with a 
gable roof of bark and grass. The side walls were 
plastered with clay. The house was partitioned with 
porches attached to the house. 

The Chickasaw were very independent 
individuals. Their independence extended Into 
every phase of their daily lives. They did not live in 
compact villages. Their towns sometimes extended 
several miles along the streams. 

They had established territorial boundaries and 
protected their domain, but being very aggressive 
people, raiding and conquering other tribes was a 
mark of achievement. They were clever and 
formidable warriors. 

They developed a calendar made of knots and 
cords and notched sticks and devised a means of 
dividing the year into four seasons by lunar cycles. 

The Chickasaw were divided into clan systems 
with a clan chief. The towns were self-governing 
and confederated as a single governing body of the 
whole tribe for means of protection and welfare, 
with a principal chief as the tribal leader. 

In 1541, De Soto made many objectionable 
demands upon the tribe. They sought tribal 
members to be used as slaves and demanded that 
they supply the expedition with livestock and 
shelter, hence, the tribe rebelled and attacked and 
burned the Spanish compound. De Soto moved 
his troops and made preparation to leave the 
Chickasaw province. 

For one hundred fifty years there was little 
indication of direct contact with the white men. 

In 1682, the La Salle Expedition contacted the 
Chickasaw while searching for a lost Frenchman 
named Prudhomle. 

The English traders arrived in the Chickasaw 
province In 1698. 

In the 1700's there was rivalry between the 
traders over trading rights with the southern tribes. 
This resulted In many wars, and the Chickasaw 
allied with the English. 



ERLC 



In 1719, the Chickasaw carried out the English 
trade interest on the Arkansas River in Oklahoma 
witt tribes in this area. 

In 1832, plans were made for the Chickasaw 
removal into Oklahoma. They ceded all their lands 
ea$ of the Mississippi to the United Statos. No 
suiuble land in the west had been found a;> late as 
1836. In 1837-38, the Chickasaw removal was in 
progress. The boundary line of their new land was 
to the west of their old neighbors, the Choctaw. 

During the Civil War, Chickasaw troops served 
in the Confederate Army.

SEMINOLE 

The Seminole, classified among the 
Muskhogean, are a people made of mainly the 
Oconee tribe and people from the Creek. The 
Seminoie opposed removal to Indian Territory and 
came into conflict with the colonists. The word, 
Seminole, is what the Creek called the people who 
separated from the main tribe and located 
elsewhere. 

Location : The Seminole were located in 
Florida and Georgia. 

Background : The Seminole, after leaving the 
main tribe, moved into Florida and built homes and 
began farming. The slaves of the colonists ran 
away and settled among the Seminole causing 
trouble between the Seminole and whites which 
fostered the Seminole War of 1819. The United 
States troops were under the command of Andrew 
Jackson. In 1819, a treaty was signed in which 



Spain ceded Florida to the United States. Now the 
settlers demanded the land the Seminole inhabited 
in Florida; a treaty was signed with the tribe and 
the Seminole were assigned land that contained 
mostly swamp. 

'The Indian Removal Act, signed by President 
Andrew Jackson in May, 1830, was followed by 
treaties with the eastern tribes for cession of land 
and their removal and settlement in the Indian 
Territory/ 

A Seminole delegation was sent to Indian 
Territory to approve lands that were to be theirs. 
Two treaties were signed, both stating that the 
Seminole approved the land, and they would merge 
with the Creek. They were opposed to the location 
of land in Indian Territory because they would be 
drawn into war with the Plains tribes who were 
already at war with each other. 

Their concerns were not recognized and the 
treaties of Payne's landing and Fort Gibson were 
ratified by the United States. 

In three years the Seminole were to start 
moving to Indian Territory. At the end of the three 
years, there was objection to the removal which 
prompted the beginning of the second Seminole 
War which lasted almost seven years. 

The war ended in 1842. "The Seminole were 
promised that several hundred members could 
remain in Florida under certain conditions. They 
stayed in the Florida swamps, but never 
surrendered." 

By 1849 the Seminole settlement had been 
located in Indian Territory. 

In 1856 the Seminole agreed to a treaty with 
conditions stating they would have their own 
government and laws, and would be provided land 
within the Creek Nation, but would not merge with 
the Creek Nation.

22. What were the unique circumstances surrounding the Seminole Indian Removal? 

The Seminole were expected to move to Indian Territory and merge with the Creek, They were 
opposed to the location of land in Indian Territory because they would be drawn into war with 
the Plains tribes, already at war with each other. When the time came to be moved, they 
objected which prompted the beginning of the second Seminole War, lasting seven years. The 
war ended in 1842 and the Seminole were promised that several hundred members could stay 
in Florida under certain conditions. They stayed in the Florida swamps, but never surrendered. 
By 1849 the Seminole settlement had been located in Indian Territory, and later established their 
own government and laws within the territory of the Creek Nation, but did not merge with the 
Creek Nation. 



Suggested Activities 

1 . Fifteen specific tribes have been covered as to LINGUISTIC FAMILY, LOCATION, BACKGROUND, and 
REMOVAL There are more tribes in Oklahoma which have not been presented, i.e., Sac and Fox, 
Shawnee, Kickapoo, Iowa, Ponca, Tonkawa, Kaw, Peoria, Modoc, Seneca, Cayuga, Ottawa, Delaware, 
Potawatomi, Euchee, and Apache, for example. 

Ask students to research the above information regarding other tribes not covered in this section. Ask 
students to present an oral report on what they learned about the tribes. Discuss the uniqueness as 
well as similarities of the Oklahoma tribal groups. 

2. After presenting the historical, cultural, and political background of the tribes, the teacher may pursue 
the issues surrounding the lives of Indians. Have students form into groups-designating a tribe they 
would be interested in representing, and discuss: 

How did the tribe get along with other tribes? (Alliances, battles, and similar customs) 

What were the characteristics of the lifestyle of the tribe, i.e., shelter, ceremonies, 

relations with the white man, permanent or temporary villages, geographical domain, etc. 

How did U. S. legislation affect the the tribe? 

a. Review the treaties - purposes and results. 

b. Re-enact the tribal "feelings" on removal. (Students would need to take the perspective of 
how a people would feel being in their homeland and then forced to move to strange 
territory.) 

c. What could the tribe(s) have done under the circumstances? Were there other alternatives? 
Discuss the possibilities. 

After the class "tribal" groups have discussed the above issues, ask a leader from each group of "tribal 
representatives" to report to the whole class about the ideas shared and discussed. 

3. An interesting approach to learning more on tribes Is to study about tribal leaders. Students might write 
biographies on a tribal leader of their choice, depicting tribal customs and practices and the role of a 
leader in making decisions regarding the tribes relations with the Anglo Americans.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON 
CREEK HISTORY 



The Creeks, whose country included all of 
Alabama and Georgia, was the nation for whom the 
linguistic stock was named. According to language 
experts, the Creeks in the Southeast region of the 
United States were of the Muskhogean linguistic 
stock. The word "Maskoke" {Muskogee) means 
creek or stream in the Creek language. So the 
word Creek is interpreted to mean "People of the 
Creek or Stream." 

Actually there was no Creek Tribe, in the sense 
that we can speak of Cherokee or Choctaw Tribes. 
The common language family led to the banding 
together of 37 small tribes and the formation of the 
Creek Confederacy. These tribes included the 
Alabama, Natchez, Koasati, Tuskegee and others. 
Other language families, including the Yuchi and a 
band of Algonkian-speaking Shawnees were 
annexed into the Conferacy. At one time the Creek 
Confederacy contained 50 to 60 towns with a 
population of 15,000 to 18,000. The tribes banded 
together for mutual protection against the 
Spaniards in Florida and were capable of throwing 
6,000 warriors into combat. 

The Creek group consisted of two main 
divisions: the Upper Creeks on the Coosa and 
Tallapoosa Rivers with 39 villages, and the Lower 
Creeks on the Chattahoochee and Flint Rivers of 
about 20 villages. The local home rule was in 
Georgia. 

Every village had about 30 houses arranged to 
form an open square around a central building, 
ceremonial square, and a play field. The tribal 
business such as war, peace, planting, hunting and 
settling disputes between individuals of the town 
was conducted in the central building. 

Each town was composed of different clan 
groups. The town chief, known as the Mekko, was 
the highest ranking official and belonged to the 
Bear or Wind clan. He was chosen to preside for 
life so long as he served the people well. He 
received representatives from other tribes and 
acted as an ambassador in transactions outside the 
tribe. 

Three warriors (tas-tan-agee) chosen from 
clans were second in rank to the chief. They 
formed the chiefs council and assisted in making 
decisions which affected the tribesmen of the town. 

Besides the clan and natural division of the 
tribe into Upper and Lower towns, two divisions 
known as "White" towns and "Red" towns existed. 
The White towns, representing wisdom and peace, 



ERIC 



attracted the town chiefs to live there. These towns 
also became a place of refuge for escaped 
prisoners. The Red towns represented war. 

Many of the European countries who were 
trying to establish a foothold in this country 
transacted business with the Creeks because they 
were one of the more powerful tribes to be 
reckoned with - if not the most powerful. The 
British, Spanish, and French all sought alliance with 
the Creeks. The European nations' strategy was to 
gain the confidence of the Creeks while vying for 
Indian land. The Creeks were on equal power 
levels with the Europeans before the 13 colonies 
were formed. Master diplomats, the Creeks 
skillfully played one nation against the others. 
Despite their efforts, the Creeks were eventually 
forced to move from the Carolinas to Georgia and 
Alabama. 

During the American Revolution, the Creeks 
sided wit 1 the Tories and fought on the side of 
Englanu. When the colonists prevailed and 
England withdrew, the Creeks found themselves 
confronted with a new enemy, the white American 
pioneers. 

Fourteen years after the 13 colonies formed 
the United States, the Treaty of 1790 distinguished 
the boundary between the United States citizens 
and the Creek Nation. By 1805, this meant a loss 
to the Creeks of millions of acres, and their leaders 
became Increasingly alarmed at the prospect of 
losing all their lands. 

In 1811, Chief William Mcintosh secured 
approval of a law forbidding the sale of any more 
tribal land under penalty of death. This law was 
inactive until 1825. Tecumseh, the Shawnee chief, 
visited the Creeks in 1811 and sought their 
cooperation in forming a confederacy of ail Indian 
tribes to check the advancing frontier of the United 
States. 

At the beginning of the War of 1 81 2, the Creek 
Council decided to stay neutral, but subsequent 
activities by Creek war parties brought on a split 
within the tribe. Most of the Indians seemed to 
favor siding with the English. They were called the 
Red Sticks, and their fatal blunder was to attack a 
United States fort and raid a nearby settlement. 
These attacks caused the men of Georgia, 
Tennessee and Mississippi Territory to spring to 
arms and later Insist on the Indian Removal to 
Indian Territory. 

The 1 81 4 Treaty of Fort Jackson ceded part of 



the Creek lands to the United States. The Creeks 
still held much of the western part of Georgia, the 
largest state east of the Mississippi River. On 
March 27, 1 81 4, 2,000 American forces and friendly 
Indians led by Andrew Jackson slaughtered nearly 
1,000 Creek warriors in the Battle of Horseshoe 
Bend on the Tallapoosa River. Jackson's men 
adopted a "scorched earth" policy as they pursued 
the Creeks, and by August, 8,200 Creeks were 
dependent on the United States for food. 

A peace treaty signed in February 1825 at 
Indian Springs, Georgia, by the Upper Creek chief, 
William Mcintosh, ceded Creek lands in southern 
Georgia to the United States in exchange for land, 
acre for acre on the Arkansas River, "commencing 
at the mouth of the Canadian Fork for quantity." 
The treaty further provided the payment by the 
United States government of $400,000 for the 
expenses of the removal of the Creek tribe to what 
is now Oklahoma. Trouble was forestalled when 
Chief Mcintosh was sentenced to death. A party of 
warriors designated to carry out the sentence set 
fire to the chiefs house, and shot him to death 
when he tried to escape. Several of the chiefs 
followers were assassinated but his son, Chiily 
Mcintosh, made a successful escape. 

The resulting uproar led to another treaty 
signed in Washington, D.C. in 1826, which provided 
Mcintosh's followers the privilege of moving to a 
new location west of the Mississippi where the 
United States agreed to purchase land for them. 
The Treaty of Indian Springs was declared null and 
void, and most of the Georgia lands were ceded to 
the United States in January 1826, as provided in a 
treaty signed in Washington, D.C, by the Upper 
Creek leaders including Menawa and Opothleyahola 

This was the beginning of the Creek Removals. 
There were a total of three Creek removals to 
Indian Territory. There were 2,500 Indians in the 
first group led by Lower Creek Chief Chilly 
Mcintosh. The second involved 1,000 Creeks under 
Joe Hard ridge in 1829, and the major removal was 
ordered by President Andrew Jackson in 1836. 

President Andrew Jackson supported the 
principle of Indian removal. The Congress of the 
United States passed the Indian Removal Bill on 
May 28, 1830, which empowered the President to 
exchange lands with any Indian tribe residing in the 
various states. After many days of bitter debate, 
attempted bribery and severe pressure, the Indian 
leaders signed the treaties. Boundaries of the new 
lands west of the Mississippi River came to be 
known as Indian Territory. 

In 1832, the Creeks signed the Treaty of 



Washington which ceded to the United States all 
their lands east of the Mississippi River. The 
exception was the Individual section which they 
were to occupy for five years unless the Creeks 
sold the land sooner. The treaty gave the Individual 
Creek the right to remain on his land if he chose, 
but his decision had to be approved by President 
Jackson. The sole effect of this treaty was that the 
Creek land title was transferred to the United States 
without compensation to the Indian. Under this 
treaty, the United States was to pay the expense of 
moving the Indians to the West as soon as they 
were ready to immigrate. 

The date of departure for ail groups was set 
for fall of the year 1832. This provision was made 
in the treaty so that crops couid be harvested. So 
tortured were the Indians over their removal that 
there was very little planting or harvesting done. 

The move was made in the depth of severe 
winters. Most of the Indians left with no more 
clothing than they wore and several were forced to 
beg from the settlers they passed because the food 
supply was inadequate. Travel was slow, tedious 
and dangerous. Rains, snow and sleet made travel 
impossible. Many Indians, due to inadequate 
shelter and clothing, simply froze to death. Camp 
was often broken at mid-morning with the Indians 
reluctant to leave their camp fires. Only a few miles 
could be covered in a day. It was estimated that 
one out of five of the emigrants died from disease, 
freezing and starvation, and at least half of the 
survivors suffered greatly from exposure and 
disease. Chief Opothleyahola led 20,000 Creeks on 
this long march across the continent. Because so 
many Indians died en route, the march was called 
'The Trail of Tears." 

Many problems faced the Creeks when they 
arrived. They were famished and empty-handed. 
An industrious people, the Creeks established their 
communal fire and began to construct dwellings 
made of deer skins and elm bark. Their stoves 
inside were made of dried mud, and meals were 
eaten from mud bowls and pots baked until hard. 
Creek communities developed along the main rivers 
in the Creek Nation. The Upper Creeks, consisting 
mostly of full blood Creeks Inhabited the 
communities along the Deep Fork and North Fork 
of the Canadian River. The mixed bloods of Lower 
Creeks established their towns along the Arkansas 
and Verdigris Rivers in the Northeast corner of the 
Creek Nation. 

After the Creeks arrived, the tribal council was 
reorganized. Wekiwa Hulwe or High Spring was 
the site of the first council house which was 



9 

ERLC 



191

constructed in 1840. 

A brief constitution was written and adopted by 
a vote of the people on October 12, 1867. There 
were three governing bodies under this Creek 
constitution: executive, legislative, and judicial. 
The executive was the governing head for four 
years and he was one of the principal chiefs of the 
nation. The legislative or national council was 
composed of tUe House of Kings (senate) and the 
House of Warriors (house of representatives). The 
1867 Constitution divided the Creek Nation into six 
districts: Coweta, Muskogee, Eufaula, Wewoka, 
Deep Fork and Okmulgee. There were 44 tribal 
towns and three towns for the Freedmen (former 
Creek slaves who became Creek citizens), all of 
which were represented in the National Council 
according to their population. The function of law 
enforcement was given to the principal chief with 
his appointed secretary. The law enforcement staff 
was composed of a captain and four privates 
known as the Lighthorsemen. 

Just as the Creek people began to reestablish 
their civilization, the Civil War erupted. Choosing 
sides caused a split in the tribe; the full bloods feit 
the war was none of their business, but the 
younger, more aristocratic mixed bloods felt the 
Creek should side with the Confederate states. The 
younger group won because it had more money 
and influence. The majority of the Creeks went with 
the Southern forces, while the rest became 
refugees and most had to flee their homes. 

After the Civil War, Okmulgee was designated 
the capitol. Okmulgee was not only the capitol of 
the Creek Nation but was well known as the 
meeting place of delegates from many Indian 
nations and tribes making up the General Council 
of the Indian Territory (1870-72). 

In 1887, Congress passed the Dawes Allotment 
Act which allowed the individual allotment of Indian 
lands and which caused the gradual decline of 
tribal government. The Congressional decree in 
1890 decided that adult Creeks of both sexes and 
their children be given a definite allotment of land 
within the Creek Nation. This decision included 
their Creek Freedmen who were to share in these 
land allotments. The necessary laws were passed 
to accomplish this act. The Dawes Commission 
was the bureaucratic body which was appointed to 
do this work. Government surveyors were sent to 
the Indian Territory to section the Creek land in 
1895. Each Creek Indian and each Creek 
Freedman was provided 160 acres of land In 1899 
after the survey was completed in 1897. The 
complete Index of all members of the tribe and the 



Freedmen became the Creek Roll. The Creeks 
were not allowed to sell their land prior to 
statehood without the permission of the Federal 
Indian Department (Bureau of Indian Affairs). 

During the period that the Dawes Commission 
was at work closing out the tribal government, as 
well as that of each of the other Five Civilized 
Tribes (1894-1907), many Creek leaders were 
prominent and active In affairs that brought 
statehood for Oklahoma. The device of the "Great 
Seal of the Muscogee Nation, I.T. M the sheaf of 
wheat and the plow - is in the lower right-hand ray 
of the five-pointed star that forms the central design 
of the State of Oklahoma. 

Samuel Checote was twice elected Principal 
Chief of the Creeks from 1867 to 1875. Born in 
Alabama in 1819, he arrived in Indian Territory 
when he was 10. At the outbreak of the Civil War, 
he enlisted in the first regiment of Creek Mounted 
Volunteers for the Confederacy. As Lieutenant 
Colonel, he served with distinction. During the 
reconstruction days after the war, he proved to be 
an influence for good government, unity and 
education. 

Locher Harjo was chief in 1876; Ward 
Coachman finished his term serving until 1879. 
After the present Council House was completed In 
1878, Samuel Checote was elected for his third 
term serving from 1879 to 1883. While he was 
chief, the stone Council House was the center of 
activities for the Five Tribes. For 12 years, he 
served his people. He died In Okmulgee In 1884. 
A marker In his honor Is on the Council House 
Grounds. 

Joseph M. Perryman was elected Principal 
Chief from 1883 to 1887. During his term Creek 
literature flourished. Bacone College was founded 
by the Baptists at Muskogee. 

Legus C. Perryman was elected chief from 
1887 to 1891. He was removed on June 1895, and 
Edward Buliette served for the remainder of the 
year. 

Isparhecher was elected Principal Chief from 
1895 to 1899. During his term, the Creek Nation 
faced such problems as white immigration, the 
foreign cattlemen invading the Creek Nation, white 
man corporations that controlled much of the coal 
deposits, and the federal department which 
continued to give more power to the Dawes 
Commission. 

The General Council adopted the "Okmulgee 
Constitution" which was regarded as the basis for 
the eventual creation of an Indian state. 

Subsequently, Pleasant Porter, a Creek chief, 



9 

ERLC 



192 



20 



( 



presided over the Sequoyah Convention, but it took 
a union of Indian and Oklahoma territories to bring 
statehood to Oklahoma. 

Pleasant Porter served as Principal Chief from 
1899 until his death September 3, 1907. He dealt 
with approaching statehood, the Dawes 
Commission, land allotments and the Sequoyah 
Convention where he proposed an Indian state. As 
he pushed Creek interests to authorities in the 
nation's capitol, President McKinley referred to him 
as "the greatest living Indian." 

Out of the wreckage of their former lives, the 
Creeks built the new Nation. Resides building 
homes, schools and courts of justice, the Creeks 
drew up a constitution and built a new national 
capitol. They buiit it so well that when Oklahoma 
was admitted to the Union in 1907, honor was 
bestowed on the Creek Nation, and her ^jople 
became citizens. 

In 1906, the Enabling Act combined the two 
territories into the State of Oklahoma. After March 
4, 1906, the Creek Nation ceased to function. For 
the next 30 years, the Creek Nation was virtually 
non-existent until the passage of the 1934 Indian 
Reorganization Act and the 1936 Oklahoma Indian 
Welfare Act. 

Moty Tiger, appointed chief by President 



Teddy Roosevelt on September 5, 1907, finished 
the term left by Porter and was the first appointive 
chief after statehood. Chief Moty Tiger had been a 
member of the National Tribal Council for more 
than 20 years when he became chief. He was a 
delegate to the Sequoyah Convention In 1905 when 
the Indians tried to establish the state of Sequoyah, 
and became a Methodist minister In later years. He 
led the adjustment of his people to a new form of 
government and a new way of life. 

The Creek towns began to send representa- 
tives to a monthly meeting in the old capitol at 
Okmulgee or at the New Town Church northwest of 
Okmulgee to deliberate on tribal matters. In the fall 
of 1934, delegates from each tribal town met for the 
first tribal election of the Principal Chief since the 
election of Pleasant Porter before statehood. 

The Council was reorganized during the early 
1 960's. Leaders from the existing tribal towns were 
involved as Council members. Quarterly Council 
meetings were held at the old Okmulgee Council 
House. The principal chiefs for the Creek Nation 
were appointed by the Secretary of the Interior until 
a law was passed enabling the Five Civilized Tribes 
to elect their own leaders. In October 1971, the 
Creek Nation elected Claude A. Cox as their first 
Principal Chief. 





EARLY DAYS LIFE-STYLES 



Creek Festivities: The cultural activities of the 
Creek people were held on sacred ceremonial 
grounds known as "stomp dance grounds." Creek 
social dances began at sunset when the moon was 
full. Hours were spent practicing songs and steps 
and making their traditional clothing. Children were 
taught dances as part of their education. Each 
dance had its own song accompanied by drum, 
rattle, and flute. The flute was made of reed cane 
and the rattles were made of turtle shells. 

Stomp dances were held to celebrate various 
occasions, such as planting time, the coming of the 
medicine man, marriage, and hunting seasons. 
There were also songs and dances that served as 
prayers to the animals since the Creeks believed all 
creations and life beings were attributes from the 
"Master-of-Breath." To begin a stomp dance, a 
leader walked around a fire. Other men followed, 
forming a circle around the fire moving in a 
counter-clockwise direction. The dancers sang in 
a continual chant directed by the leader. The 
rhythm of the feet sounded like a stomp on the 
ground. The women Â» "ve turtle shells tied together 
and filled with small pebbles strapped to their legs. 
By shuffling their feet, the women created the 
rhythm. The circle of dancers was made up of a 
man, woman, man, woman, and so on. 

Because corn, or maize, was the most 
important food to the Creeks and had a great 
significance for the life of the tribe, it was natural 
that many ceremonies were connected with it. The 
most festive occasion for the Creeks was the Green 
Corn Ceremony. This was the celebration of the 
first ripening of the corn in summer and served as 
the tribe's new year. The complex rites of the 
Green Corn Ceremony lasted for about eight days. 

Songs, dances, and games were played during 
the week. The square and the camp sites were 
cleaned. A specially appointed firemaker would 
arrange four logs crosswise and build a new fire. 
The fire was considered to have considerable 
sacred power. The women would take some of the 
new fire's coals and kindle a pile of logs on their 
own hearth which had also been cleaned. The men 
and women drank a black herb mixture that 
cleaned and purified their bodies. They then fasted 
before the new corn was tasted for the first time. 
After the purification process, preparation for the 
dances was made and the feasting began. 

The women had their own dance called the 
"Ribbon Dance." They dressed in colorful dresses 
covered with many ribbons. All the women would 



have to fast until the leaders of the dance could be 
chosen. The women leaders were chosen from the 
elders first. The women leaders carried sticks 
painted red on the ends. These were waved in 
rhythm. Sometimes the sticks were replaced by 
knives also painted red. 

Religion. The religious ceremonials centered 
around the celebration of the corn harvest. The 
cultivation of corn was one of their chief 
occupations, so Creek religious activities were 
highly concerned with this important product. The 
Creek people sing and dance around a fire 
seasonally for their sacred ceremonies. These 
people were known as Stomp Dancers. 

The native Creek beliefs were that all creations 
and nearly all reasons for being alive were simply 
attributed to the "Master-of-Breath" or 
"Hesaketvmese" They believed a good life would 
be rewarded. However, some witchcraft was mixed 
in with their beliefs. Converting their religious 
concepts to Christianity posed few problems 
because of the single-god belief. 

They also had prophets who they believed 
conferred with the supernatural in diagnosing 
disease and predicting the future. The Creeks 
highly regarded the prophets because they believed 
their special powers came from the one above. 

In the 1700's, the Stomp Dancers would not let 
the Creeks convert to Christianity. The early 
Christian Indians had to hide or be punished for the 
new religion and life they had accepted. Many of 
them broke away from much of the Creek culture. 

Today the Creek people in Oklahoma still 
belong to the two factions: the traditional and 
those professing Christianity. The latter are 
predominantly Methodists and Baptists. 

Funerals. The burial customs of the Creeks were 
simple but very meaningful to them. Funerals were 
sometimes held in the homes since the family burial 
grounds were near the home site. The body of the 
deceased was kept four days before being taken to 
the burial ground. The body was never left 
unattended. On the eve of the funeral day, an all- 
night wake service was held. If the person had 
been a Christian, then sermons, songs, and prayers 
were delivered for the deceased. 

On the morning of the funeral, grave diggers 
would begin very early. Family members would put 
the individual's favorite clothes and small amounts 
of food and tobacco in the casket. Creek parents 



209 



would rub their hands over the face of the 
deceased and then rub the faces of their children in 
order to keep them from grieving. At the end of 
four days, the body was taken to Creek burial 
grounds and lowered into the grave. A fire was 
built at the head of the grave and tended for four 
days by relatives until the soul was believed to have 
reached the passage to the sky. 

After the burial, the family always washed 
themselves with an herbal medicine from the 
medicine man. The Creeks believed this washing 
helped relieve the pain of their loss and cleansed 
the grave area. 

After four days, women would go to the home 
of the deceased and clean the house. The men 
would build a little house over the grave. Even 
today, many of the traditional Creeks still build 
these little houses over their graves. The Christian 
Creeks have eliminated most of their traditional 
burial customs, but they still continue to have their 
all-night services now held in a church. Most of 
these churches have cemeteries where the 
members can be buried. 

Games. The Indian Stick Bail Game is played 
during the last dance of the season or during the 
stomp ground's winter dance in late September or 
October when the weather is cool. The game is 
commonly played on or adjacent to the Stomp 
Dance grounds. 

There are two types of stick ball games. One 
is the social game or fun game pitting men against 
the women. Each man uses two ball sticks about 
3-1 /2 feet long with one end shaped like a cup or 
pocket. The sticks are usually hand carved from 
hickory wood. The hard, tough ball was smaller 
than a tennis ball and was made by the medicine 
men using rolled up animal skin. Since it had to be 
thrown long distances and suffered much wear and 
tear, the b*!! needed to be heavy. 

i he women used their hands, but the men 
were never allowed to touch the ball with their 
hands. The goal was usually a cow's skull on a tall 
pole. Some stomp grounds used the image of a 
fish on the pole. Points were scored by hitting the 
cow's skull (or fish). Played before or after the 
Stomp Dance the game looked like a wild scramble 
as the men and women competed for the ball. The 
team with the most points won. Two people kept 
score. 

The Match Game was played by opposing 
clans or opposing Stomp Dance groups. One team 
represented the Rising Sun or the East, and the 
other represented the Setting Sun or West. The 



number of players sometimes totaled 30 on each 
side. The ball field resembled a football field in size 
w'th two goal posts. The goals were two upright 
poles about 7 to 8 feet tall placed 3 to 4 feet apart 
with a cross bar, placed at opposite ends of the 
player area. 

The object of the game was to send the ball 
between the goals either by throwing it with the 
sticks or by carrying it in the sticks' pocket to score? 
a point. Each point was scored by sticking a peg 
in the ground. Rules of the game called for 
penalties if the ball was touched by the hands. The 
ball was often difficult to get off the ground. The 
game was played with the man-to-man defense. 
Wrestling was an outstanding feature of the stick 
ball game unless previously arranged ground rules 
prohibited it. If one man on the opposing team 
was hurt, the other team member who was 
guarding him had to leave the game. Spectators 
usually joined in the game without sticks but with 
much gusto cheering for the East or the West. 
They never called out a person's name. The first 
team to reach a certain number of scored points 
was declared the winner. 

Prior to a game, dances and feasts were held 
to increase enthusiasm. Women would sing special 
stickball songs that would encourage their teams to 
victory. When the contests started, the players 
lined up on the field with a series of whoops that 
continued throughout the game. The players wore 
only breech cloths and painted their bodies to suit 
their desires. 

Clans. In the early history of the Creek Nation, 
their entire population was divided into clans. The 
clan functioned as a social and political unit 
because the tribal organization was built around 
families. According to the Creeks, the Master-of- 
Breath created the clans, and the animal identity 
was given as each passed before him. They 
believed that man and wild animals could speak 
with each other and be understood. 

The names of the various clans were taken 
from totem animals such as Bear, Panther, Wind, 
Deer, Bird, Fox, Snake, Beaver, Alligator, Mink, 
Skunk, Buzzard, Rabbit, and Raccoon. Each clan 
had a special design for its animal clan 
identification which was usually found outside their 
log houses on a pole. It was considered a serious 
offense for one to kill or eat an animal resembling 
those on his totem, and any person making 
unfavorable criticism against another person's clan 
was fined by the offended clan. 

Clan descent came from the mother's side of

the family because the mother was regarded as 
head of the household. Marriage relationships, like 
other aspects of Creek life, were influenced by the 
clan laws. Marriage within a clan of the tribe was 
forbidden. All males belonging to one clan referred 
to each other as brothers, and the females were 
addressed as sisters. When the husband lived with 
his wife's family, he could not become head of her 
clan. Traditionally, the woman owned the belong- 
ings and property. In today's changing times, if a 
Creek man marries a non-Indian woman or a 
woman from another tribe, the children born to this 
couple belong to their father's clan. 

Children. The children of the Creek Indians were 
taught to respect their elders and to listen to their 
wisdom. As they grew up, the children could 
neither interrupt when adults were visiting or 
conversing with other people nor speak unless 
spoken to. They were not allowed to sit in on adult 
conversations. When visitors came, the children 
would shake hands with them, acknowledge them 
and depart. Parents were very strict with children 
who disobeyed this common courtesy. 

Usually boys were given names in a special 
ceremony when they reached the age of 12. In the 
event the children became orphaned, relatives 
would take them rather than have them separated 
from their family ties. The children's duties from 
birth to five years were to help the women. 

Marriage. Young men and women exercised some 
degree of choice regarding marriage although the 
advice of the woman's female relatives was usually 
sought, and permission or her maternal uncles 
might be required. A Creek husband seeking a wife 
sent suitable presents to her mother, aunts and 
grandmother after consultation with the girl's 
maternal uncles. 

If the presents werp accepted, a simple 
marriage ceremony was quickly arranged. 
Afterward, the man came to the bride's tribe to live, 
took the necessary steps for raising a garden and 
a crop of field corn, and began to conduct his 
affairs in a manner suitable to his new responsi- 
bilities. The marriage was in a trial stage until the 
husband built a house and harvested a crop. 

Divorces were very rare in families with 
children. Polygamy was a common practice 
among Creeks. Usually, a husband obtained his 
first wife's consent before marrying a second time, 
and in many cases the later wife was a sister of the 
first spouse. 



Food and Cooking. Near by each dwelling, the 
Creek women maintained a small garden plot for 
their family. Their main food supply, however, was 
grown in a much larger field which belonged to the 
entire town. 

Corn, beans, squash, pumpkins, and melons 
were plentiful. Wild fruits were also available for 
their use. They dried meat, corn, pumpkin, 
peaches, and apples. When beef was dried, they 
sliced the meat into very thin slices and placed it 
on clean cloths in the hot sun on the roof of the 
house. They turned this jerked meat over several 
times a day. The fruit was also dried in the 
summer either by hanging it on sturdy cord or 
drying it in the same manner as the beef on top of 
the house. Most of the dried food was stored in 
bags for the winter. 

Hickory nuts and acorns were pounded and 
the mashed nut meat was placed into boiling water. 
The oil was then skimrned off the top and used in 
much of their cooking, especially In preparing 
hominy and corn cakes. Deer was the main meat 
eaten; but, they also fished. 

Sweet corn was preserved by boiling it until 
tender. Then the kernels were cut off the cob. 
This, too, was processed in the same manner as 
the meat and fruit. The corn was cooked with lye 
or mixed with ashes and beaten to make hominy 
grits or meal. Their most important food was 
*ofkey which was beaten corn cooked with water 
and lye. This would even be consumed after 
setting two or three days and turning sour. 

Another Creek dish was N blue dumplings" 
which was made of beaten corn and with bluish 
burned shells of the field pea added. Abuske or 
"cold flour" was a drink enjoyed by the Creeks. It 
was made by stirring a meal made of parched corn 
into a glass of water and sweetening it to their 
taste. 

Beyond the houses stretched the clan-owned 
farmland. Fields were planted with maize, squash, 
pumpkins, beans, and after the Europeans 
introduced them, melons, rice and potatoes. 
Women did most of the tending of crops. 

Men were hunters and fishermen. They 
hunted deer, bear, beaver, otter, raccoon, and 
squirrel with a black hickory or locust bow, and 
cane arrows. They were adept In the use of the 
cane blow gun and the white man's firearms. They 
were good fishermen, too. They used hook and 
line, spear, and a hand net. They practiced the art 
of fish poisoning. They stored a fixed portion of 
their food in a public granary. Therefore, they were 



211 

196 



protected during war emergencies and against poor 
yields. Travelers through their country could also 
be fed at the expense of the entire community. 

Medicine. The Creek Indian doctor always faced 
East In a special place where he prepared 
medicine. He cared for physical illness and 
alleviated pain and emotional suffering caused by 
the loss of loved ones and other mental anxieties. 

Many of the Indian doctors were taught by 
their fathers, so each one varied In his practice. 
They learned many songs and chants that were 
used while preparing medicine and also learned the 
different kinds of herbs, leaves and roots he 
needed. The Creek doctor fasted time and time 
again. He also practiced purification at all times for 
he regarded this to be sacred. Since it was sacred, 
he was very careful about when and where he went 
to look for the roots, herbs and leaves. 

Indian doctors used the following materials in 
mixing their potions: sassafras root, devil shoe 
string, tobacco blossoms, mullen leaves, wild 
cherry bark, milkweed, red cedar, blackberry root, 
charred coals, red root, black root, dogwood, pine, 
willow, sumac, poke, persimmon, corn, jimsen 
weed, ash tree buds or bark and spider web. 

These various medicines were used for 
diarrhea, dysentery, burns and scalds, fever, pain of 
Insect bites and stings, urinary infections and 
ailments, worms In children, chest colds and 
chronic disease of the liver. Some medicine men 
made medicine to consecrate ceremonial grounds 
each year when the Creeks prepared for the 
summer activities, especially the Green Corn 
Festivals and the stick ball game. 

Clothing. A winter animal-skin dress was a typical, 
two-piece Creek outfit. The skirt was calf length 
and included leggings, moccasins and an over- 
blouse. Both the skirt and blouse were fringed. 
Leggings protected the Indians from briars and 
snakes. Gradually In the 1600's, the Creek women 
began to fashion their dress out of satiny cloth 
material brought by the early explorers. Glass and 
sliver beads decorated their dresses. 



In the 1700's, the Creek dress was patterned 
after the white, colonial women. This type of dress 
was made of cotton. The blouse had a yoke with a 
gathered bust to the waist and a band attached to 
it. The skirt was also gathered at the waist with 
three or more ruffles bordering along the bottom of 
the skirt. An apron with deep pockets was usually 
worn over the dress. The women wound their hair 
around their heads fastened with a silver brooch 
and attached silk ribbons of several colors that 
hung down almost to the ground. 

The men wore ruffled sh rts, a breechcloth with 
fringed ends that hung from the belt, and leggings 
decorated with silver bells, lace or beads. The shirt 
was belted at the waist with a wool sash decorated 
with tassels and beads. A broad-beaded band 
worn over one shoulder held a tobacco pouch. 
Sometimes short cloaks woven of feathers were 
worn. 

Both the men and women wore moccasins 
made of soft deerskin and embroidered with beads. 
The boys only wore one piece of clothing called a 
"sweep/ This was merely a long shirt that almost 
touched the heels. A belt was occasionally worn 
with the sweep. 

Language. The Creek language belongs to the 
Muskhogean language family. Other languages In 
this group include the Chickasaw, Choctaw, 
Tuskegee, Alabama, Natches, Miccosukee, and 
Seminole. People speaking a dialect of the Creek 
language In one area may have difficulty 
understanding Creeks In another area. 

About 1840, missionaries devised a writing 
system for the Creek language. The language had 
not been recorded before this time. The first 
publications were the Bible and other religious 
works. 

Four forms of communicating were spoken: 
language, silence (body language), picture writing 
and symbols. The early Creek words were peculiar 
In that they appeared In the bilingual dictionaries 
with few vowels. The Creeks used one word to 
express several English words. Most of the words 
contained the letter "k. H

TULSA 



Legend has it that Yahola took hot coals from 
the tribal ceremonial fires in Alabama and used 
them to kindle a new fire each night on the long trip 
west. Ultimately, Yahola is said to have reached 
Tulsey Town (Tulsa) and lighted a fire beside a 
groat oak with the coals brought from Alabama. 
Until he died In 1858, Yahola presided over the 
councils In Tulsâ‚¬7 Town. 

Apparently the exact date of the establishment 
of the village of Locharpoke on the site of Tulsa is 
not known. It could have been as early as 1828, 
but more likely it came in the 1830's. By 1850, it 
was known as Tulsey Town and had a population 
of 150. 

The Creeks lived in one- or two-room log 
cabins rather than tipis, for the Creeks were one of 
the "Five Civilized Tribes." Their favorite gathering 
place was a large oak tree at 1730 S. Cheyenne 
Avenue which Tulsans refer to today as the Creek 
Council Oak. The site was preferred because the 
people could watch the canoes and rafts on the 
river, the basic artery of travel. The dense forest 
growth in the rich bottoms along the river created 
what Mcintosh called "an impenetrable vastness" 
which stood as a bar to travel by land unless one 
was content to stay on the higher lands of the 
prairie. 

Stomp dances were held at the council tree 
site. The residents of Tulsey Town invited 
neighboring tribes to come. 

The Creek Nation lay south of what is now 



Edison Street and Admiral Place, and Tulsey Town 
was at the north edge. North of that line and west 
of what is now Elwood Avenue was the Osage 
Nation. To the east of the Osage boundary and 
north of the Creek boundary lay the Cherokee 
Nation. 

The Osages, Cherokees, Shawnees, Quapaws, 
and members of other tribes came to Tulsey Town 
for the stomp dances and the Creek ball games. 
The Indians came and camped for days. Amid 
such socializing, many intertribal marriages 
resulted. 

After the Civil War, the known history of Tulsey 
Town for several years revolved around the 
Perryman family. George Perryman, a livestock 
grower, hauled lumber from Coffeyville and built a 
house. In 1878, the house became Tulsa's first 
post office with Perryman's brother, J.M. Perryman, 
as the first postmaster. Another brother, Legus 
Perryman, was chief of the Creeks for several 
years. 

The foundation of modern Tulsa was laid in 
January 1882 when a contract was signed for 
extension of the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad from 
Vinita to near the Arkansas River in order to better 
compete for the area's cattle business. The 
terminus was to be on the Cherokee side of the 
Cherokee-Creek line, but H.C. Hall, the railroad 
contractor, found that more liberal business 
concessions could be obtained from the Creeks 
than from the Cherokees. The terminus was

therefore moved a half mile west into the Creek 
Nation. J. M. Perryman and "Has" Reed of 
Coffeyviiie opened a store near the terminus, and 
Perryman moved the post office into It. 

Only Creek citizens and those who were 
married to Creeks could iegaiiy do business in the 



Creek Nation, so the town at the end of the tracks 
grew very slowly with only 300 settlers in 1895. 
The townsite was surveyed in 1900. In this 
framework, Creek women and their husbands 
became the first citizens of the future city of Tulsa, 
Oklahoma. 




THE CREEK SEAL 



The Great Seal of the Creeks or Muscogees, 
the name that they used in referring to themselves, 
shows a sheaf of wheat and a plow in the center of 
the device surrounded by the words, "Great Seal of 
the Muscogee Nation, IT." 

Adopted by the national council after the war 
between the states, this seal was a modern 
symbolism of the industry of the Creeks as 
agriculturists from earliest days. After coming to 
the Indian Territory, the successful growing of small 
grain, especially wheat and some oats and rice, 
besides large crops of corn in the rich lands 
bordering the Canadian and Arkansas rivers and 
their tributaries, brought prosperity to the Creeks. 
Connected with ancient tribal customs, the "Green 
Com Dance" was celebrated in summer as a 
thanksgiving and rejoicing in the new crops and 
marked the beginning of the new year in the nation. 
The sheaf of wheat and the plow in the center of 



center of the device had a broader significance 
reflecting Christian influence of the Creek chiefs 
and leaders. The Methodist and Presbyterian 
denominations were particularly strong In the 
nation. From the adoption of the written 
constitution of the Muscogee nation In 1867 to the 
close of this government just before Statehood, 
these two church organizations counted 
outstanding leaders and principal chiefs as 
members. 

A biblical interpretation of the sheaf of wheat In 
the Muscogee seal may be found in Josephs 
dream (Genesis 37:7): "For, behold, we were 
binding sheaves in the field, and lo, my sheaf arose, 
and also stood upright..." 

An interpretation for the plow may be found in 
the prophecy (Amos 9:13): "Behold, the days 
come, saith the Lord, that the plowman shall 
overtake the reaper..."

LEGENDS 



The Story Teller 

In the early days, the Creeks maintained and 
developed the highly skilled storytelling technique 
for recording their history because they had no 
written language, The storyteller was one of the 
most important men in the village. He was so 
highly respected for his knowledge that he was very 
seldom allowed to go into battle for fear of his 
death which would mean the loss of a village 
historian. 

Each generation In every village had a youth 
selected to become the future storyteller. He was 
usually chosen from the young men who had the 
best memory and who liked to tell of things which 
had happened to them. He was trained by the old 
storyteller and would memorize the history of his 
people so that he could instruct the young people 
in the village. When he grew old, he would train 
another youth and so on. In this manner, the 
history of the people was never forgotten. 

The storyteller also served as the village 
entertainer on many occasions. If he was very 
good, he could keep the village amused with the 
colorful tales of lore and the many legends which 
existed about the animals of the forest. In many 
ways, this was how the young men and women 
learned of the marvels of the earth and its bounty. 

Natural Phenomena 

There are several classes of myths among the 
Creeks. The first, origin of the earth, is related to 
the animal spirits. The other class had to do with 
a time when the Master-of-Breath took charge. The 
Creeks believed that they were made from the red 
earth of the old Creek Nation. The white man, they 
belived, was made from the foam of the sea. The 
majority of the tales refer to animals on the earth. 

How the Clans Came To Be 

In the beginning, there were no Indian people 
on the new lands. A great fog clothed the whole 
land in darkness. As the first Indian people be'jan 
to crawl out of a hole in the earth, they were forced 
by the fog to gather in grc jps for their protection. 
The groups wandered over the land praying to the 
Master-of-Breath until, finally, the Wind blew the fog 
away. The first group of Indians who could see the 
land were very thankful and they called themselves 
the Wind Clan (group or family). 



Each group of Indians took the name of the 
first thing they saw as the fog was blown away. 
Other clans that were named were the Panther, 
Deer, Bird, Bear, Raccoon, Beaver, Mink, Otter, 
Fox', Mud Potato, Alligator, Skunk, Rabbtt, and 
Snake. However, the Wind Clan was always 
considered the first clan and the aristocracy of all 
the clans. 

The Master-of-Breath spoke to them: "You are 
the beginning of each one of your families and 
clans. Live up to your name. Never eat of your 
own clan, for it is your brother. You must never 
marry Into your own clan. This will destroy your 
clan if you do. When an Indian brave marries, he 
must always move with his wife to her clan. There 
he must live and raise his family. The children will 
become members of their mother's clan. Follow 
these ways and the Muskhogeans will always be a 
powerful face. When you forget, your clans will die 
as a people." 

How the Earth was Made 

At last the excitement had died down. The 
news that Crawfish had brought back . the 
Council from the new lands below was important. 
Birds, he explained, could live on the new lands; 
animals could find their food for their survival. 

The mighty Eagle walked to the center of the 
fire and began to speak: "We are all filled with joy 
in our hearts to find that we cannot only send fish, 
but also birds and animals. Now we must prepare 
the lands for the coming of the new creatures, for 
they cannot live on the lands as they are now. I 
have an idea; I will ask permission from the Great 
Council to help create better land below. * 

"Yes, yes," the Council cried, M lt Is our wish that 
the lands be a good place to live." The Eagle 
walked to the Crawfish and took the wet soil from 
between his claws. Round and round he rolled the 
soil between his claws. Round and round he rolled 
the soil between his powerful legs. Then, with a 
mighty flapping of his huge wings, he soared high 
above the Council. 

"What is he doing with the earth in his legs? 
Does he Intend to steal It?" they cried. Then, with 
a mighty swish, he hurled the red ball of soil 
earthward. The soil traveled so fast that It looked 
like a shooting star falling from the sky. A mighty 
roar sounded when the ball hit the oceans, making 
a large wave that parted the water. The red soil 
spread out and flattened so much that the earth 



ERLC 



was made In one move. 

At first, the lands were very wet; so the Eagle 
flew over them and dried them with his mighty 
wings. Soon the lands were dry enough to let the 
animal migration begin. 

The Thunder Helper 

Once there was a boy who had no mother or 
father. All day long he would take long walks and 
play by himself. 

One day as the boy was walking along the 
creek, he heard a noise like thunder. When he 
looked up, he saw a Tie-snake and the Thunder 
having a fight. 

The Tie-snake called to the boy saying, "Kill the 
Thunder, and I will tell you everything I know. I 
know all the things that are under the earth." 

Just as the boy was putting an arrow to his 
bow, he heard a loud noise. It was the Thunder 
speaking to him, "Boy, boy, don't pay any attention 
to the Tie-snake. I, Thunder, can help you to be 
brave, strong and wise. Shoot your arrow at the 
Tie-Snake." 

The boy shot at the Tie-snake, killed him, and 
the Tie-snake fell Into the creek. 

Now the Thunder made the boy strong, brave 
and wise, but the Thunder told the boy never, 
never, never, never to tell anyone that the Thunder 
had made him strong, brave and wise. 

The boy became the best hunter and the best 
runner in the village. He was good and kind to all 
of the people. When he talked, the people listened. 

In the cold time, the people were very hungry, 
for there was no food and very little corn. Many 
days passed, and the boy stood before them and 
said, "Last night the owl In the tree talked to me. 
The owl told me to come to his tree. He told me 
there was a bear sleeping In a hole In the ground." 

The young men of the village laughed at him 
for saying the owl had talked to him; but the old 
men did not laugh, for they were wise in many 
things. They knew the boy was wise too. 

One of the young men did not laugh. He told 
the boy he would go hunt the bear with him. He 
knew the people were hungry and needed meat to 
eat. 

The young man and boy went to the tree with 
the owl In it. By the tree, in a hole in the ground, 
they found the bear sleeping. They killed the bear 
and took it back to the village. The people were 
happy to have much meat to eat. 

Now, when the boy said something, the people 
found what he said was true. 



The time came when the men of the village 
went to fight. Many men were killed. The women 
were so afraid; they knew the enemy would come 
and burn their village. The boy stood before the 
women and said, "Do not be afraid. I will go and 
kill the enemy. They will not burn our village." 

The boy went into the wood and found the 
men of the village. He said to them, "Stay where 
you are. I will go to meet the enemy and kill them. 
Never again will the enemy try to burn our village." 

The men watched the boy as he went to meet 
the enemy. They saw the thunder and the 
lightning. The thunder and lightning came down 
upon the enemy. All the enemy were killed. 

The men waited in the woods for a long time. 
The boy never came back. No one In the village 
ever saw him again. 

When the old men hear the thunder and see 
the lightning, they know what to think. They are 
now wise in many things. They are sure that they 
hear the boy call in the thunder, and when the 
lightning Illuminates the sky, the old men are sure 
they can see the face of the boy. 

'The Thunder Helper laughs," the old men say, 
and then they go to sleep unafraid. 

How the Indian Got the Medicine 

Now it came to pass that the first Indian who 
became iil did so after he had killed the Deer. The 
spirit of the Deer was angry. The Deer Spirit told 
the Indian, M l gave you the first sickness for killing 
me. I also have the cure for this disease. Bring 
your wisest brave to me, and I will tell him how to 
cure the Deer Sickness." 

A search was made of all the Indians. They 
sought the Indian with the greatest mind. The 
Council took the chosen one to the place In the 
dark forest where the Deer Spirit spoke: "Only the 
man selected to receive the secret of the medicine 
may stay." 

The Deer told the brave that he would have to 
go deep Into the forests and must remain alone. 
He must not eat for many moons. He must not 
speak to any man. "When this is done," the Spirit 
ordered, "return to me." 

After the days of starvation in the forests, the 
man heard a voice speaking to him. "You have 
been chosen to keep the medicine for all your 
brothers. You will be their Medicine Man." 

The Spirit spoke the following words: Tor 
each animal will give man a disease, and each 
animal has a cure for that disease. You must find 
those cures. Take these secrets that you find and 



ERIC 



202 

217 



keep them together. This will be most powerful and 
valuable. You must guard i ; Many will try to steal 
it. Bundle it up. Each time t re Is a new sickness, 
I will give you a sign at the new fire. This sign will 
help you cure the new sickness. The animals will 
bring the cures." 

"Each year bring this wonderful medicine back 
to the Green Corn Dance and open all magical 
cures to your people. When you grow old, you 
must take a young brave and teach him how to 
know the cures to help his brother. Give him the 
tests to make sure that he will make a good 
medicine man. Many false men will want to get the 
medicine," *h<i Deer Spirit said. 

"I will give you a part of my breath. Go and 
Wow on the sick. Give them the medicine of the 
herbs and roots that I tell you. This will make them 
well." 

The first medicine man returned to the Deer 
and cut the tip of his antler. This was the first 
magic object In the sacred medicine bundle of the 
Muskhogean. 

Rabbit Outwits Psnther 

Rabbit and Panther were friends. They were 
traveling together. After a while, they came to a 
place where there was a creek with a bad name. 
It was "Dogogaga hatch!" Now, Rabbit wanted to 
go on and said that, since the creek had a bad 
name, it would not be good to camp there for the 
night. He said, This creek has a bad name." 

"Why Is that? M asked Panther. 

"Because everybody who camps here at night 
gets burned up!" Rabbit told him. 

"Well, I think it will be all right," remarked 
Panther. "We will camp here anyway." 

Rabbit did not want to, so he said to Panther. 
But, at last they made ready their camp for the 
night, as Panther would go no farther. When it got 
late, they prepared to sleep. They had talked all 
the evening about the evil place and other things. 

Now Rabbit asked Panther, "What kind of noise 
do you make when you are asleep?" (He meant 
how did he snore?) 

Why, I say "Nutslagum! Nutslagum! 
Nutslagum! M said Panther. Then he asked Rabbit 
what kind of a noise he made when he slept. 

"I say, "Nuts! Nuts! Nuts!" replied Rabbit. 

Now, they went to bed, and In a short time, 
Rabbit pretended he was asleep. He began to 
snore, saying, "Nuts! Nuts! Nuts!" and Panther 
thought that he was surely asleep, so he went to 
sleep himself, snoring "Nutslagum!" 



Now, when the Panther was sound asleep, 
Rabbit got up, took a piece of bark and shoveled 
many coals from the fire on it. Then he threw the 
coals on Panther and fell down quickly, lying as 
though he had been asleep all the time. Panther 
jumped up howling with pain and woke Rabbit. 
Panthej told Rabbit that he was right, that he had 
been nearly burned to death. Rabbit would only 
say, "I told you so. I told you so." 

Pretty soon, they settled down to sleep agfcin. 
As soon as Rabbit heard Panther snoring, he 
thought that Panther was asleep and got up and 
played the same trick on him again. But, this time 
Panther was only pretending to be asleeo 2r*j ne 
caught Rabbit in the act and jumped up to kill him. 

Rabbit barely escaped Panther's claws and ran 
as fast as he could. Panther gave chase. Several 
times he nsariy caught him, but Rabbit managed to 
keep ahead of the furious beast. But, soon he 
began to lose strength. To save himself, he made 
an ocean spring up between himself and the angry 
Panther. Panther could not get across the water. 
And that is why there Is an ocean. 

Why the Rabbit's Head is Flat 

A rabbit was trying to get some girls to date 
him. He asked and asked, but no one wanted to 
go out with him. 

Finally, two girls decided to play a trick on him. 
They decided to accept his date and began making 
some plans. Rabbit was very happy to finally find 
somecne to date. He went to the girls' house, and 
as it got late, the girls asked him to spend the 
night. 

"Oh, you don't have room for me. I see only 
one bed," he said. 

"You can sleep with us," they said. "You can 
get in the middle." Their plan was working. He 
finally consented to spend the night, sleeping 
between the two girls. They kept scooting closer 
and closer together as they had planned, crowding 
him, until finally they pushed so hard for so long 
that his head became narrow. That Is how the 
rabbit got a flat head.

Log Cabin 



Early homes and shelters of the Creeks. The mud and grass house, the 
thatch and brush arbor were the types of dwellings the Creeks had before 
their removal from the Southeast. The log cabin came into existence by 
the influence of the early pioneers and this type of home was used after 
the removal during the Indian territorial days before statehood.

CREEK WORDS CONSTRUCTED 
ACCORDING TO MEANING 



Creeks did not have words for some things so 
they simply talked about an object by describing it. 
For Instance, children were not given names but 
were referred to as daughter or son of so and so. 
Boys were given names after lengthy observations 
by their elders. At a special ceremony at age 11, 
the name was given if the boy had earned it By 
fasting. Many times women never received names 



except after they were married when they were 
called "wife of so and so." 

Notice that the words for the days of the week, 
the months and the direction actually describe the 
day or month rather than just naming it. Notice 
that the words for directions are colors.

literal meanings:

ART - FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS 
(Yarn Painting â€” Grades 1, 2, and 3) 



INTRODUCTION: 
OBJECTIVES: 



MATERIALS: 



PROCEDURE: 



BACKGROUND: 



Yarn painting is giuing yarn on cardboard to make scenes or designs. This 
is an ideal project for studying Indian design. 

For a subject - start with their pets, an Indian family, or a scene with which 
the children are familiar. Study Indian designs which incorporate these, 
inventing ways to lay the yarn, so that it makes a smooth (or rough, if 
desired) finish. Suggesting some interesting texture Is the area for originality 
and creativity. 

cardboard 

yam in different colors 
Elmer's glue 

1. Students are encouraged to make original designs of people, animals, 
or scenes. These are drawn on the cardboard with pencil. Or, they 
can work out their plan directly with yarn. 

2. Elmer's giue is applied over small areas at a time. This is important so 
that the adhesive does not dry out where the yarn is being applied. 

For motivation, children are shown a finished sample of Indian designs and 
the object of the lesson is explained. 




INDIAN MASKS 




Buffalo Mask Spirit Mask 




ART - CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND SIMILARITY 
(Paper Mask Making Grades 4, 5, and 6) 

OBJECTIVES: 1. To provide students with visual illustrations of differences and similarities in 

Indian and non-Indian cu\lv j$, study maps showing the groupings of Indian 
tribes in different parts of Oklahoma. 

2. Learn how Indian tribes are identified; how they differ with each other; how 
they differ from non-Indian people in Oklahoma today; and the ways in which 
Indians have the same life style today as other citizens of our State. 




MATERIALS: 

wheat or cooked flour paste 
heavy paper towels 
newspaper 

PROCEDURE: 

1. Make a two inch fold lengthwise into three double 
sheets of newspaper (stacked). Fold the entire paper. 
(See Figure 1 .) 

a. Wrap the fold around the wearer's chin, face and 
the top of the head. (See Figure 2.) 

b. Overlap the edges and secure with paper strips. 
(See Figure 3.) 

c. Apply wheat or cooked flour pasta 

2. Lay the ring of paper on a flat surface and fill with 
wadded newspaper. The paper should extend a little 
beyond the rim, to avoid a sunken face. (See Figure 4.) 

a. A bulging nose or eyes may be made and 
attached with paper strips. (See Figure 5.) 

b. Hold In shape with large bits of newspaper, applied 
with paste. 

3. Cover entire form with three or four layers of 
overlapping paper strips (the last one being heavy paper 
toweling). 

BACKGROUND: 

Study pictures of Indian ceremonials, or attend powwows, of 
various Indian tribes. Sketch the masks of the dancers. 
Pattern your masks after specific masks and learn their 
meaning.

ART - CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND SIMILARITY 

(Positive-Negative Mask Making - Grades 4, 5, and 6) 



OBJECTIVES: 



MATERIALS: 



1 . Use the students' environmental experiences as a source of subject matter. 

2. Examine students' Ideas of Indian culture. 

3. Study the Indian's love of nature as expressed in ceremonials. 

4. Copy masks used in these dances. 

blunt pencil 
styrofoarn wig head 
Magic marker 



PROCEDURE: 

1. Discussion of purpose of positive-negative 
effects and decorative facial designs. 

2. Idea plan. Draw two full head shapes of paper, 
side by side, for front and back of head. 

3. Divide head shapes In hatf vertically, placing the 
general shape of the facial features found on a 
wig head In place - these may vary depending 
on the design of the wig head. 

4. Work In a positive-negative manner so the areas 
of design remain even In placement, and 
accurate. Example: Eyes and brows on left 
solid, eyes and brows on right outlines, leave 
thin white area when outlining. 

5. Transferring to wig head - use a blunt pencil, 
pressing lightly, and ruler to divide the head in 
half vertically. 

a. Large areas of design may be drawn out on 
paper and cut out and used as a pattern so 
both halves are alike (this is good if pattern 
or shape is going to be reapeated in more 
than one area. 

b. Using a blunt pencil "map out areas on wig 
head following same positive-negative 
pattern (stress accuracy of balanced effect). 

c. Use Magic marker to fill in solid areas of 
pattern design and to outline white areas. 
Fill In around the white areas last. (DO not 

put hand on an area where magic marker has just 
been used, ft will smear easily).

ART - CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND SIMILARITY 
(Papier Mache Figures - Grades 7, 8, and 9) 



OBJECTIVES: 1. To study art history and costume design, a unit can be exciting and 

"fun" If Indian dress, especially the clothing of the dancers of different 
tribes, is examined before the project Is begun. 

2, This project can teach the craft of papier mache, drawing, painting, 
clothing and history. 

MATERIALS: pencils 

white construction paper (12 M x 18") 

decorative materials from home (ribbons, buttons, fur, yarn, beads, scraps 

of suede and wool) 
acrylic paints 
shellac 

4" wood cube 



PROCEDURE: 1. Each student can make a pencil drawing on 12 M x 18" white 

construction paper of any Indian clothing that interests him/her. 

2. Next make a papier mache doll In the position of the drawing 
(approximately 12" high). These can be painted and shellacked and 
yarn hair can be pasted on the heads. The dolls can now be dressed 
In class with materials brought from home (ribbons, buttons, fur, braid, 
beads, etc.) and shared with each other. 

3. These completed dolls can be mounted on a 4 M block of wood, The 
students can then paint their drawing like their finished figure. In this 
way, the students can copy the designs and colors of the materials 
used. The paintings can be outlined in ink, 



BACKGROUND: Use books from the school and public libraries shov/ing Indian chiefs or 

Indian dancers. Study the various clothing to learn the meaning of each type 
of headdress, jewelry, outfits. 

In addition to studying art books, visiting museums, attending cultural 
festivals and performing art events will provide the student with visual 
illustrations of differences and similarities in Indian and non-lndlar cultures. 

By studying the clothing of various cultures, we find that many items are 
borrowed back and forth until their origin is lost, 

Plains Indian women adapted much of their dress from the Civil War era 
fashions worn by the wives of officers stationed at military posts in the 
southwest. Today we find some of these being re-adapted by non-Indian 
designers.

ART - CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND SIMILARITY 
(Plaster Carving and Sculpture - Grades 7, 8, and 9) 



OBJECTIVES: 1. Most middle school (grades 7-9) art students have a strong desire to 

carve forms, but too often they are afraid of failure. The objectives here 
are to develop a project where there are no failures and to make the 
carving process an interesting and stimulating experience. 

2. Plaster carving can be a big success, with this method. It looks and 
sounds so easy that everyone wants to try it. As a result, every student 
who really tries can turn out excellent and unusual carved pieces. 



MATERIAL: styrofoam cups (various sizes) 

sealers (gesso, varnish, or shellac) 
tempora or acrylic paints 
plaster of paris 



PROCEDURE: 1. Styrofoam cups (different sizes) are filled with plaster of paris. When 

set, the cups are torn away, a conical shape which can be used right 
side up, upside down, or horizontally. Each student is free to make a 
choice. 



2. The form should dry thoroughly before a sealer is used. This may be 
accomplished by using gesso, varnish or shellac. Be sure to use 
sealers that are compatible with the type of paint that you use. 

3. Other effects can be achieved with tempera and acrylic polmer paints. 
Commercial spray paint and finishes also offer further possibilities. 
Some prefer not to seal and paint but leave the form in its original state, 



BACKGROUND: Now on exhibit in the American Hall of Fame park area at Anadarko are 

eighteen handsome, sculpted portraits in bronze of Indians noted in 
American history. The sculptors Include famous artists in this country, 
Unveiling ceremonies of some of these sculpted portraits have been held in 
different parts of this country with large audiences present: the Black Beaver 
statue and the Allen Wright bronzes In the state capitol at Oklahoma City; 
Osceola, in the Seminole Everglade region In Florida; Charles Curtis in the 
Old Supreme Court Chamber In Washington, D.C.; Alice Brown Davis in the 
Oklahoma Pavilion, New York World's Fair; Pocahontas, in Old Towar 
Church, Jamestown, Virginia, Others that were erected are: Tecumseh, 
Pushmataha, Massassoit, Hiawatha, Keokuk, John Ross and Stand Watie. 

Creative ideas can range from free forms to busts of these and other famous 
Indians. All ingredients for shaping three dimensional forms are present. 
This material, which Is inexpensive for classroom use, gives many 
challenging and rewarding experiences for the beginning sculpture student.

ART ~ VALUE CLARIFICATION 
(Indian Jewelry Making - High School) 



OBJECTIVE: 



MATERIALS: 



The different and most unusual designs make the best types of jewelry. 
Encourage the student to use his/her own ideas and never use the idea of 
another student to create an outstanding piece of Indian jewelry.

PROCEDURE: 



1. 




ERLC 



Metal 

Silver tarnishes have to be polished 
frequently. Copper and brass both 
have to be coated with a glaze or 
covering to prevent tarnishing and 
are best suited for jewelry that is not 
worn next to the skin. 



rawhide mallet

saw frame & blades 
ring sizer 
ring mandrel 
propane torch

steel wool 
polish-rouge-tripoli 
brush 



Before starting a piece of jewelry, get an idea of what you want to make 
and what metal you want to make your jewelry out of. Draw this idea 
on paper, then trace it on the metal you are going to use. 

Sitting at a table or counter with a bench pen, string your jewelers saw 
and begin sawing along the draw lines with a verticle motion of the saw. 
Always saw straight up and down. Saw until all pieces are cut out for 
your design. 

With the heavy file, file away all rough spots, edges, etc. Filing is done 
on the up stroke, not up and back. Metal has few scratches so file only 
the edges. 

If you are making a ring, now is the time to shape it on the ring 
mandrel. Place the metal over the mandrel and hammer both ends over 
the sides of the rawhide hammer. Join the two ends together and 
prepare to solder. 

Flux, which is white paste, is brushed on the metal on both sides. This 
keeps the fire from the torch from burning the metal, leaving what Is 
called fire scale. Place 3 or 4 tiny squares of solder to the joint with 
tweezers on the flux and apply. Ught the propane torch and begin 
heating the metal in a sweeping, figure eight motion until the metal 
begins to redden, then concentrate heat on joint to be soldered. Solder 
will ball up then flow into and seal the joint. Flux will bubble and turn 
white then crystal clear. 

After soldering, pick up the metal, with the copper tongs (tweezers) and 
drop into the sperix (pickle-solution). This cleans the metal. The metal 
stays in this solution until all fire residue is removed. With the copper 
tongs, remove metal from sperix and rinse under cold water and dry 
with a dry cloth. 

246 

231 



7. All file marks are removed with sandpaper and this is used in grades or 
grits. The coarser grit is used first and, aftor each grit, the metal Is 
washed with soap and water. After the last grip Is used, a light buffing 
with steel wool is needed, then wash again. 

8. The final step is the polishing. If the metal is polished by hand, use 
small squares of leather or suede with the polish. First use tripoii then 
rouge and soapy water, between changes of polish. A mirror finish can 
be achieved. 

9. The same procedure is used for all fabricated jewelry except those 
pieces which are not soldered and in that case omit steps 4, 5, and 6. 

10. All pieces of jewelry that have any metal joined to them require steps 
4, 5, and 6. 

1 1 . Add stones to the metal pieces if they are a part of the design. 

BACKGROUND: In order to provide the students with a program which will supply the basis 

for forming a "Value Complex" regarding cultural groups, they should be able 
to study current trends in various art fields. This study should include the art 
of other ethnic groups as well as Indians - (attend art shows and explore 
museums, especially those showing the multicultures of the Southwest). 

Study the current popularity and appreciation in the value of Indian paintings 
and Indian jewelry in particular. The student should form and express an 
opinion as to the reason for this increase in interest and value in Indian art. 
What is the social significance in this change in attitudes? 




INDIAN SILVERWORK 



Because It Is widely known, Indian slh/erwork 
is usually thought of as an ancient craft. Actually 
It Is one of the most recent to be adopted by tribes 
In the Southwest 

The first silver ornaments used by the 
Southwestern Indians were obtained through trade 
or warfare with the Spanish or other tribes. 

In the mld-1800's It was the custom for 
Mexican smiths from the Rio Grande valley to roam 
through the plains country producing silver trinkets 
In exchange for horses. It was from these itinerant 
craftsmen that the Plains Indians learned the art In 
the late tBSCs. 



The squash blossom necklace provides the 
best example of an adapted Item. Generally 
thought of a typically Indian, its Individual parts can 
be traced to outside sources. The squash 
blossom Is merely an elongated version of the 
small silver pomegranate once worn by the 
Spanish men as a trouser and cape ornament The 
crescent-shaped pendant, or naja, originally 
appeared suspended form the center portion of the 
sliver mounted bridle. This decoration came to the 
New World via Europe after the Spaniards 
borrowed It from the Moors of North Africa.

ART VALUE CLARIFICATION 
(Distinguished Indian Heroes and Heroines) 



OBJECTIVES: 1. Students will learn about several of the outstanding Indian heroes and 

heroines who have made and continue to make significant contributions 
to the lives of their people and to the nation. 

2. This study will provide inspiration for today's young men and women 
who, emerging as leaders of the future, will continue unbroken the 
ancient tradition of the people's dignity and pride. 

3. Students will express their knowledge of the lesson by preparing a 
detailed drawing in mural form. 

MATERIALS: roll of wide paper or large poster board 

Magic markers or paints 
press-on letters 

Following research, each student presents his/her ideas in a large 
picture that may be used in its own right elsewhere. 

Measure and cut paper to fit wall space. 

Mount so the work may be viewed at a distance as it progresses. 

Mix paints, considering the colors of the room where it will be used, 
background paper, and subject matter. 

Decide on a title; select lettering, if needed. 

Each child contributes to the mural what she/he enjoys most and does 
well. 



Students can pick a hero-heroine and draw their story, or they can work in 
groups, drawing murals of their hero-heroine of Indian descent. There are 
many from which to select. Three of the four portraits by Charles Banks 
Wilson in our state capitol share Indian ancestory. 

In the art of dance, one national critic declared that Oklahoma has 
unquestioned leadership among the states. Five of the major names in ballet 
are from Oklahoma and are of Indian descent - Yvonne Chouteau, Maria 
Tallchief, Marjorie Tailchief, Rosella Hightower, and Moscelyne Larkin. The 
University of Oklahoma is one of the few universities in the nation offering a 
degree in ballet.

THE FIRST FIRE 



In the beginning there was no fire. The world 
was cold, until the Thunders who lived above sent 
their lightning and put fire into the bottom of a 
hollow sycamore tree which grew on an Island. 
The animals knew the fire was there, because they 
could see the smoke coming out at the top of the 
tree, and they wanted it to warm themselves. But 
they could not get to it because of the water. So 
they held a council to decide what to do. This was 
a long time ago. 

Every animal that could fly or swim was eager 
to go after the fire. The Raven offered to go and, 
because he was so large and strong, all the others 
thought he could do the work. So he was sent 
first. He flew high and far across the water and 
alighted on the sycamore tree. But while he was 
wondering what to do, the heat scorched all his 
feathers black, and he was frightened and came 
back without the fire. 

The little Screech Owl volunteered to go and 
reached the Island safely. But while he was looking 
down Into the hollow tree, a blast of hot air came 
up and nearly burned out his eyes. He flew home 
as best he could, but tt was a long time before he 
could see well. And his eyes are red to this day. 

The animals held another council, for still there 
was no fire and the world was cold. But birds, 
snakes and four-footed animals all had some 
excuse for not going. They were all afraid to 
venture near the burning sycamore tree. But the 
Water Spider at last said she would go. She was 
not the water spider that looks like a mosquito but 
the other one with black downy hair and red stripes 
on her body. 

She can run on top of the water or dive to the 
bottom. She would have no trouble getting to the 
island. But how could she bring back the fire? 



"Ill manage that," said the Water Spider. 
Whereupon she spun a thread from her body and 
wove it Into a bowl which she fastened to her back. 
Then she crossed to the island and went through 
the grass to where the fire was still burning. She 
put one little coal of fire Into her bowl and came 
back with it. Ever since we have had fire, and the 
Water Spider still keeps her bowl. 




Encourage students to think of similar stories to tell the class. Help the students to find books 
and materials of Indian related literature. Observe the interest of the student in the story and his 
desire to hear more. n m

(Indian Oral Traditions III - Grades K-4) 

OBJECTIVES: At the end of the lesson the student will express continued interest in Indian 

stories by selecting Indian related reading material for free reading. 

MATERIALS: Puppet (from Indian Oral Traditions I) 

Cherokee Animal Tales by James Mooney (from Indian Oral Traditions i) 

PROCEDURE: 1. Briefly introduce Tittle Deer." 

2. Read or tell the story M Howthe Deer Got His Horns. M 

3. Help the student select Indian-related reading material. 

BACKGROUND: 

HOW THE DEER GOT HIS HORNS 



In the beginning, the Deer had no horns. His 
head was smooth, just like the doe's. He was a 
great runner. The Rabbit was a great jumper and 
the animals were all curious to know which could 
go farther In the same time. The animals talked 
about it a good deal. At last, they arranged a 
contest between the Deer and the Rabbit and made 
a nice pair of antlers as a prize for the winner. The 
Deer and the Rabbit were to start together from 
one side of a thicket, go through it, then turn and 



come back. The one who came out first was to get 
the horns. 

On the day chosen for the match, ail the 
animals were there. The antlers were laid on the 
ground at the edge of the thicket to mark the 
starting point. While everybody was admiring the 
horns, the Rabbit said, "I donl know this part of the 
country. I want to take a look through the bushes 
where I am going to run. H 

The animals thought that was all right So the 



237 252 



Rabbit went into the thicket. But he was gone so 
long that, at last, the animals suspected he must be 
up to one of his tricks. They sent a messenger to 
look for him. The messenger found him, away in 
the middle of the thicket, gnawing down the bushes 
and pulling them away until he had a road cleared 
nearly to the other side. 

The messenger turned around quietly and 
came back and told the other animals. When the 



Rabbit came out of the thicket, they accused him of 
cheating. He denied it, until they went into the 
thicket and found the cleared road. They agreed 
that such a trickster had no right to enter the race 
at all. So they gave the horns to the Deer, who 
was named the best runner, and he has worn them 
ever since. They told the Rabbit that, as he was so 
fond of cutting down bushes, he might thereafter 
do that for a living - and so he does to this day. 



EVALUATION: 



No evaluation is required for this lesson. The teacher may help students with

(Apache Children's Games of Jackstones - Grades 1, 2, and 3) 



INTRODUCTION: 



OBJECTIVE: 



PROCEDURE: 



Many Indian games are the antecedents of popular games of non-Indian 
cultures. A great number of these games are mathematical in nature, 
especially the rules for scoring. Participation in these games by both Indian 
and non-Indian children can serve the two-fold purpose of acquainting the 
children with aspects of Indian cultures and serving motivational and 
recreational purposes in elementary mathematics. 

After participating in the game of "Jackstones, " the student will be able to 
compare the rules and procedures of the game with those of the 
contemporary game of "jacks." 

Four to five girls, seven to fourteen years of age, play together. Several 
variations of the game are possible. Successful completion of a sequence 
is scored as one point with the game completed when a player scores five 
points. 

1. Four stones are juggled while the player walks from one mark to 
another approximately ten feet apart. 

2. The player attempts to pick up four stones successively with one hand 
and put them on the back of the other while a fifth stone is repeatedly 
thrown into the air and caught. 



3. The player "cups" one hand and attempts to place the stones one by 
one into the cup while repeatedly tossing and catching the fifth stone.

Divide the class into two equal groups aligned parallel to each other 
approximately six feet apart. Place 21 counters made of small sticks 
between the two groups. Provide background music so that players may 
move In time to the rhythm. The player with the button makes various 
motions in time with the music to try to conceal which hand is holding the 
button from an opponent. Then the player thrusts out both hands in a 
closed position. If the opponent guesses the correct hand, he takes a 
counter for the group, if not the other group takes a counter. The button Is 
passed to a member of the group which received the counter. The game is 
played until one group has all the counters.

Number Four in Cheyenne Ceremonial Rites - Grades 7, 8, and 9) 



OBJECTIVE: 



PROCEDURES: 



MATERIALS: 



EVALUATION: 



The students will be able to relate incidents of the use of the number four in 
Cheyenne Indian Ceremonial Rites and compare these with the significance 
of the number in similar situations in non-Indian cultures. 

Many ceremonial rites were held in the medicine lodge by the Cheyennes. 
The true significance of the number four in these rites is probably lost in 
antiquity; however, comparisons are possible with the use of the number in 
non-Indian cultures. Students can read accounts of the midsummer 
ceremony of the Cheyennes which is commonly called Medicine Lodge and 
find many examples of the ceremonial use of the number four for 
comparative purposes. 

Copies of descriptive accounts of the Medicine Lodge ceremony 

(A source is in the book, The Cheyenne Indians, Their History and Ways of 
Life by George Bird Grinnell, published by Cooper Square Publishers 
Incorporated, New York, New York 1962.) 

Students can be evaluated on the number and nature of comparisons that 
are established.

MUSIC 

(Indian Songs - Grades K-6) 



INTRODUCTION: This lesson is designed for use by the teacher in the self-contained 

classroom and for use by the music teacher in the elementary school. This 
lesson can easily be incorporated into a unit of study on the American 
Indians by the classroom teacher or it can be used by the music teacher 
when doing interdisciplinary team teaching. 

OBJECTIVE: 1. The student will recall three subjects Indians like to sing songs about. 

2. The student will sing two verses of an Indian chant using the correct 
words without prompting. 

3. The student will demonstrate the proper corresponding rhythm of Indian 
chant by hopping and jumping to the beat of the chant. 

MATERIALS: There are no specific materials needed to conduct this lesson. However, if 

the teacher so desires, drums and shakers can easily be made by students 
to be used when singing the chant. 

A drum can be easily constructed by taking a two or three pound coffee can 
and stretching a portion of an innertube over the open end of the can and 
securing it very tightly. Shakers can be made by placing small gravel in a 
tin soft drink can and taping the holes closed. 

PROCEDURES: 

A review of the culture of the American Indian 
should be made paying special attention to the 
area related to the important tribal occasions and 
celebrations which were generally accompanied by 
song and dance. 

If the teacher planned to utilize the drums and 
shakers in teaching this lesson, she could follow 
the review of the American Indian culture with a 
project of making drums and shakers. They could 
be made in an art class and painted with Indian 
designs or they could be made in the self-contained 
classroom as a special project. 

Once the students have studied the cultural 
aspects of traditional Indian songs, it would 
enhance further understanding of the Indian culture 
to give the background of the rabbit song and the 
horse riding song before they are taught to the 
students. 

The rabbit song can be introduced by 
explaining that it had a meaning of happiness and 
security. All Indian children, through the teachings 
of their parents and through the observation of 
animals in the wilderness had learned to respect 
and to understand animals. One interpretation of 




the rabbit song is that it tells a story of a rabbit who 
lives in the forest. This little rabbit enjoys hopping 
and playing with friends without fear of the wolf or 
hunter because his parents are near by to warn him 
of danger and because he has keen hearing and 
can tell when danger is approaching. 

The Indian children learn to use the Indian sign 
for rabbit, which Is holding two fingers up behind 
each ear. This sign is used by the children during 
the song as they hop and mimic a rabbit while they 
sing the rabbit song. 

The rabbit song has two stanzas which can be 
repeated as many times as desired. 

To begin the teaching process, a copy of the 
rabbit song should be given to each student. The 
teacher should go through the song first to 
demonstrate the musical notes of the chant. It is 
easier for students to learn an Indian chant when 
they can see the words and hear the music 
simultaneously. 

Once the students have listened to the chant, 
the students and teacher can go through the chant 
together to get the proper rhythm and tempo. 
Once the students have learned the chant, it is 



possible to arrange the class so the following group 
arrangements may occur. 

One group of students can play the drums, 
one group can sing and one group can dance to 
the chant. The dance is a simple rabbit hop to the 
rhythm of the chant, each dancer will use the Indian 
sign for rabbit while dancing. The addition of 
shakers can be made at the discretion of vhe 
teacher. Once the chant is learned and the 
students develop the skill of dancing to the rhythm 
of the chant, listening skills can be improved by a 
complete pause after each stanza. If the students 
are doing the rabbit dance, they should freeze 
completely during the pause. This creates a game 
type atmosphere which the students will find most 
enjoyable. (See Rabbit Dance Song.) 

There Is a considerable amount of 
documentation in American history as to the great 
horsemanship and outstanding riding feats of the 
American Indian. The American Indian placed a 
high priority upon the skill of horsemanship and 
because of this priority the Indian child learned to 
ride at a very early age. 

Once the Indian child had learned to ride, he 
was taught to sing the horse riding song. The 
meaning expressed in this song indicated that the 
rider was the master of his horse and that the rider 
enjoyed riding the horse to the hunting grounds on 
long trips and when need be, to fight his enemies. 



This song was generally sung by Indians, both 
adult and child, as they were riding their horses. 

In the process of implementing this song, the 
drums and shakers may be utilized by the students 
in this activity. The students may be divided into 
groups according to the objectives established by 
the teacher. 

Introduction of the Riding Song should be in 
written form and the teacher should demonstrate 
the musical notes of the chant. As mentioned 
previously, it Is easier for students to learn an 
Indian chant when they can see the words and hear 
the music simultaneously. 

The same procedures for learning this chant 
may be followed as was followed in the rabbit song. 

In teaching the horse riding dance to 
accompany the song, the teacher has the option to 
adjust the dance according to the space available. 
The students may either stand in one general area 
and move up and down in a bouncing motion as if 
they were riding a horse, or they may lope in a 
circle as if they were riding a horse. The student 
will pretend to be holding the reins of the horse 
while they dance. All movement should be to the 
tempo and rhythm of the chant. 

The tempo of this song may be changed. The 
faster the horse is going, the faster the tempo of 
the chant. 



BACKGROUND: 

Indian people have always sung about events 
and things they related to, just as non-Indians sing 
about events and things they relate to today. The 
American Indians have songs about love, death, 
war, peace, the important animals in their lives, the 
weather, going on trips, getting married and many 
other subjects. 

In some tribes, the older people had a song 
that they would sing related to growing old. This 
song toid that they were happy to be alive and was 
usually sung in the morning. 

In other tribes, the Indians would sing about 
the staple crops that they wanted to plant and 
harvest. Other tribes had songs about the buffalo 
which provided food, clothing and shelter. 

in some areas of the United States, the 
weather was the determining factor of life and death 
for some tribes just as growing crops and hunting 
animals was for other tribes. In these areas here 
were songs about wind, rain, and extremely cold or 



hot weather. 

Generally, with most tribes, the songs are in 
the form of a chant. The words of these chants do 
not have a specific meaning. The meaning is in the 
song as a whole. 

The songs of a tribe were preserved just as the 
history of tribes were preserved. They were passed 
from generation to generation by way of mouth. 
Indian songs were taught by father to son. Often 
the first songs taught to young children were songs 
about the things Indian children liked or things they 
liked to do. As the Indian children grew older, they 
were exposed to varied songs for specific 
occasions and for specific emotions. 

Often when an Indian tribe had an occasion to 
celebrate some event the Indian children would 
move away from the adults to sing and dance 
songs of their own. The Rabbit Dance Song and 
the Riding Song were very popuiar with young 
Indian boys and girls.

PHYSICAL EDUCATION 
(Buffalo Hunt - Grades K-1 2) 



OBJECTIVES: 



1. To throw the blunted s\.zar through the Inner ring of the rolling hoop 
one out of five attempts from a distance of ten feet. 

2. To demonstrate an understanding of the basic purpose of Indian games 
by describing at least one Indian game and explaining the cultural 
purpose of the game. 



MATERIALS NEEDED: 1. 



Two spears with blunted ends whose length and weight will depend on 
the age of the children throwing the blunted spear. 

A hoop with approximately a 20* diameter which has an inner hoop of 
approximately 10' In diameter. The hoop can be made In class to add 
more to the study of Indian heritage. The use of leather strips and 
green tree branches make materials very accessible. 




PROCEDURES: 



The teacher should Introduce the background 
of Indian games and in particular the background 
of the Buffalo Hunt game before going into the 
playing procedures. Once the children have been 
exposed to the background of why Indian children 
play the games they do, it will make the association 
of the game to Indian heritage more meaningful. 

The teacher can divide the class into four 
groups of students. Boys and girls should be 
equalized in number among the four groups. 
Groups one and two will be on one team and 
groups three and four on the other team. 

The playing area can either be the outside 
playground or the gymnasium. The space should 
allow the two teams space to set up so that the 
rolling of the hoops and the throwing of the blunted 
spears does not endanger any student. 



By placing the students who are throwing In 
back to back positions, greater safety may be 
achieved. The students who are rolling the hoop 
are in a position to always be out of the target area. 
(See illustration at the top of the next page for 
placement of groups.) 

The first person in group one will be the 
thrower, the last person in the group will be the 
Individual that rolls the hoop parallel with the 
thrower so he/she may have the opportunity to 
throw at the target from a right angle. The thrower 
after throwing goes to the end of the line of group 
two. Everyone in group one advances one 
position. The first person in group two retrieves the 
hoop and goes to the end of line one to become 
the roller of the hoop. This process Is followed by 
both teams until each player has had the

opportunity to throw the spear one or tw > times, 
which is predetermined before the game. 

The teacher places him/herself in the center of 
the area between the two teams and between the 
groups so she/he may judge when the spear goes 
through the inner ring of the hoop. If the spear 
goes through the inner ring, that team gets one 



point. The team with the largest number of points 
when the game is completed will be the winner. 

Once the older children have developed the 
skill of throwing the spear, they may want to 
attempt throwing at the target while they are 
running parallel to the rolling target. 



BACKGROUND: 

The games that Indian children were taught 
always had a purpose. Although the games were 
fun to play and provided the physical activity to 
develop their motor skills, there was a certain 
degree of seriousness involved in all games. 

Many games were designed to teach the 
children hunting skills, such as throwing spears, 



shooting bows and arrows, or the games were 
designed to develop courage and competitive 
attitudes. T hese skill areas and attitudes were a 
necessity for young Indian boys and qirls to acquire 
if they were going to protect their homes from 
warring tribes and were going to provide food for 
their families.

READING 
(Grades K-12) 



OBJECTIVES: 



1. To acquaint the students with the culture of the American Indian. 



2. To trace the development of Indian communication from symbols and 
sign language to the alphabet developed by Sequoya. 

MATERIALS NEEDED: A wide range of reference books. 

Books about Indians on many levels of readability 

PROCEDURES: 



Introduce the unit through a visitor. If 
possible, invite a person who will dress in authentic 
Indian clothing and be able to present interesting 
information about Indian customs. If Indian 
children are in the classroom they may be helpful 
in securing someone or contributing information. 

Next, provide a wide range of reading material 
concerning the American Indian. Keep in mind 
each student's reading ability and assist him in the 
selection of material he can handle. 

Instruct the students to browse through the 
material, keeping a list of areas that may be 
covered in the study. After the browsing period, 
supervise a classroom discussion of the areas 
students have discovered. Each student may 
choose the area which interests him most. Form 
committees to work together in researching each 
area. 

After subject areas are assigned, the students 
may return to the reading materials for 
concentrated study. The committees may prepare 
booklets which will contain information about their 
subjects, drawings they have made, and any other 
materials they have accumulated. 

If the teacher has an aide or parent volunteers 
the booklets may be bound. The teacher in a large 
classroom may find this too time-consuming to 
attempt alone, unless students are capable of 
directing themselves. 

When all the booklets are completed, there 
may be a sharing period. Each committee may 
appoint a representative to tell the class about the 
area . *. searched. Booklets may be shared with the 
class and eventually donated to the library or 
placed together in the classroom for future 
reference. 



Possible areas of research may include family 
life, food, clothing, the Indian and the buffalo, 
medicine men, Pueblo Indians, jewelry, language, 
Indian art, Indian tribes, religion, education, 
transportation, hunting and fishing, tools and 
weapons, tribal life, poetry and music, and folklore. 

To trace the development of Indian 
communication through sign language and symbols 
to the use of the alphabet, familiarize the students 
with examples of each. Place a daily message in 
sign language on the board or on a worksheet for 
the student to decipher. Ask students to 
communicate with sign language. Students may 
write messages with Indian symbols. Many 
published materials have worksheets based on 
these symbols. 

Other interesting projects related to the study 
may include any of the following projects: 

1. Learning Indian dances. 

2. Constructing miniature Indian villages. 

3. Designing and making Indian jewelry or 
other objects d'art. 

4. Cooking authentic Indian dishes. 

5. Reading biographies of famous Indians. 

Climax the study with an assembly program to 
be written and produced by the class, it may be a 
panoramic view of the entire history of the 
American Indian or a glimpse into the way of life of 
the early Indian.

SEQUOYAH 



Sequoyah is the only man known in history to have Invented and perfected an 
entire syllabary. He accomplished in twelve years that which developed gradually 
over centuries among the Egyptians, Phoenicians and Greeks. Born during the 
1770's near Fort Loudon, Tennessee of mixed-Wood parentage (one-half 
Cherokee), he had no schooling nor could he read, write or speak English. 
Sequoyah, whose England name was George Guess (Gist), submitted his syllabary 
to a public test among the leading men of the Cherokee Nation and was awarded 
a medal of honor by the Cherokee government in 1825 In recognition of his great 
achievement. He was an influential statesman among the western Cherokees in 
Arkansas and one of their delegation to Washington in 1828. 

When the Cherokee Nation was established In the West in 1839, education 
and the dissemination of knowledge through the printed word, made possible by 
Sequoyah's invention, were re-established and flourished among the Cherokees. 
This work formed the background for civilization and culture throughout the Indian 
Territory, and became one of the foundation stones for the state of Oklahoma. His 
cabin near Sailisaw has been preserved by the Oklahoma Historical Society as an 
historic site.

SCIENCE 
(Will it Dye? - Grades 1-6) 



INTRODUCTION: 



The nature of science is to observe and investigate in order to determine 
patterns. The powers of observation of the American Indian were extremely 
-*cute whether the observation related to natural phenomena or to human 
nature. The solution to the Indians' survival problems often rested in his 
ability to observe and ascertain patterns. Any type problem which requires 
the student to observe and keep records is an acceptable science activity. 
The sample lessons which follow are only two examples of investigations 
which relate to traditional Indian culture. 



OBJECTIVES: 



1. To develop the students' ability to conduct investigation. 

2. To develop the students' ability to record any data. 

3. To learn methods used by the Indians to dye fabrics. 



MATERIALS: 



1. 10 cm square pieces of white cotton cloth (pieces cut from old bed 
sheets are excellent). 

2. Several miik cartons for mixing the dye and dying the cloth 

3. Berries, bark, leaves and flowers for making dye. 

4. Wooden dowel for crushing materials. 



PROCEDURE: 



Many natural materials when crushed and soaked in water can be used to 
dye fabric. This method was used and is still used in some cases by Indians 
today. 

Allow the students to crush a natural material in a milk carton and then add 
a small amount of water. Allow the square of cotton cloth to soak in the 
mixture to see what color is obtained. Students should also carefully record 
the type material used and the amount along with a description of the color 
obtained. 

After the squares have been dyed and have dried, have the students hand 
wash them in a mild detergent to determine if the color is fast. 



BACKGROUND 
INFORMATION: 



Almost any natural material will produce some color. Poke berries and black 
berries will produce colors ranging from red through violet. Green leaves will 
produce green colors and best results are often obtained when the leaves 
are crushed in rubbing alcohol. Flower petals will produce a wide variety of 
colors. 



After the students have used natural materials to dye cloth, they might like 
to try making paint. Try making a paste of the crushed materials and lard. 
The resulting paint can be used for painting pictures. 

Don't overlook rocks and clay as a source of natural colors.

SCIENCE 
(It Sounds Fishy ~ Grades 1-6) 



OBJECTIVES: 1. To help students learn about plant growth. 

2. To demonstrate the value of organic material as plant fertilizer. 

MATERIALS: seed corn 

10 milk cartons half full of river sand 
5 dead fish, 2-3 inches long 

PROCEDURES: Plant 4-5 seed corn in each of five of the containers of river sand, in the 

other five containers, fill about 1/4 full of sand and add one dead fish and 
then add some more sand until the container is 1 /2 full of sand. Plant 4-5 
seed corn in each of these containers. Water all 10 containers lightly and set 
in a warm place (sunlight is not needed until the plants germinate). 

Have the students keep a record of the time required for germination of each 
plant. After plants have germinated, take out all but one plant in each carton. 
Measure the growth of all plants at two-day intervals and make a graph of 
the growth for each. 

Have the students predict the growth patterns of each plant. 

If you would like to carry the activity further, the Soil Conservation Service 
or County Agent has information on plant nutrients and soil testing. 

BACKGROUND: The river sand required for this investigation can be obtained from a lumber 

yard. Obtaining the fish can be a weekend project for your students. 

Many students have worked in home gardens and flower beds and will quite 
rapidly predict different growth rates for the corn. Try to help students 
understand that the process of decay provides nutrients for the plant to use 
in growth. 

Be sure that after germination, all plants get equal amounts of sunlight and 
water. 

As corn was a staple food of many tribes, you might like to combine this 
activity with a lesson about the Indians' use of corn and the Importance of 
com In the Indian culture.

SCIENCE 

(Religion and Medicine - Grades 5 and 6) 



OBJECTIVES: 



PROCEDURES: 



1. The student will become familiar with the religious aspects of the 
Choctaw 1 people. 

2. The student will be able to describe some of the medicine practices of 
the Choctaw people and how it influences their lives today. 

1. Present the background information to the class. 

2. Give the evaluation and have a discussion time. 

3. Have the students bring some of the items used from the environment 
by the medicine man. 



BACKGROUND INFORMATION: 

The Choctaws anciently regarded the sun as 
a deity for several reasons: (1) To the sun was 
ascribed the power of life and death. He was 
represented as looking down upon the earth, and 
as long as he kept his flaming eye fixed on anyone, 
that person was safe, but as soon as he turned 
away his eye, the individual died. To the sun, also 
they attributed their success in war. 
(2) In ancient times, fire, as the most striking 
representation of the sun, was considered as 
possessing intelligence, and as acting in concert 
with the sun. The fire and sun were supposed to 
have constant communication with each other and 
the fire acted the part of an informant to the sun. 
And it was an ancient saying of theirs, that if one 
did anything wrong in the presence of the fire, the 
fire would tell the sun of it before the offender could 
go any distance at all. 

The Choctaws had no idea of a being purely 
spiritual. They conceived that the Ishtahullo chito 
possessed human shape, and, in speaking of him 
often called him "the Man Above." His dwelling 
place is regarded as being somewhere on high. 
The representation of the Choctaw was, that when 
the Creator had made the earth and its Inhabitants 
(the red people) and had given them their civil 
regulations, he returned to his place above, and 
they saw and heard nothing more of him. 

The philosophy of the ancient Indian taught 
him to concentrate upon the spirit land and to 
believe that the Influences which surrounded him in 
Nature - above, beneath, around - were sent 
directly by the spirits - the good and the bad 
who were continually at war with each other over 



him, the good directing all things for his prosperity 
and happiness, the bad directing all things against 
his prosperity and happiness. He knew that within 
himself he could do nothing as he was utterly 
helpless in the mighty contest that was waged over 
him by the good and bad spirits. 

Therefore, all things in nature, as a natural 
consequence, indicated to him the presence of the 
spirits, both good and bad, as each made know 
their immediate nearness through both animate and 
inanimate nature. The sighing of the winds, the 
flight of the birds, the howl of the lone wolf, the 
midnight hoot of the owl, and all other sounds 
heard throughout his forests both by day and night 
had most potent significations for him. He governed 
all his actions and never went upon any enterprise 
before consulting the signs and omens and acting 
in conformity thereto. If the medicine was good, he 
undertook his journey; if bad, he remained at home, 
and no argument could induce him to change his 
mind. 

The Soul and Ghosts 

The Choctaws believe that the shilup or soul 
survives the body remaining for a time near the 
spot where the body was buried. After that, they 
say, it goes away. They do not know where it 
goes, nor do they appear to be Interested. 

In ancient times, they believed In a happy, 
paradisiacal in which the season was always spring 
time, people were always young and handsome, 
and activities were always joyful. This "land of 
ghosts" did not have to be deserved, however.

Everyone went there except murderers. Death was 
regarded as a transition period; the mortal shed his 
earthly existence much as a snake sheds its skin. 

Nearby, within sight of this paradise, was the 
place to which the ghosts of murderers went. They 
could see their former associates enjoying 
themselves in the adjoining land, and the murderers 
were made miserable by comparing their lots with 
those of people who had committed no such 
crimes. 

Every man has two souls - shilombish, or 
outside shadow, which aiways follows him; and 
shilip, or inside soul, which goes to the land of 
ghosts. 

The shilombish supposedly remained on earth 
and wandered restlessly about the area the body 
had formerly occupied. Often, by its pitiful moans, 
it frightened survivors. It was this shadow, too that 
had the ability to take on the shape of a fox or an 
owl. For that reason, the ancient Choctaw feared 
these animals. 

However, they said, it was possible to tell the 
real animal from a shilombish by listening carefully. 
When a bonafide owl screeches, or a fox barks, 
another animal of that kind will answer it. If the 
sound is made by a ghost assuming that animal 
form there is no answer. Ancient Choctaws had 
many fears of ghosts and assumed that to see the 
ghost of a departed one was a sure sign of death. 
A sick person seeing a ghost would despair of 
getting well, and his doctor would cease to treat 
him, realizing that his efforts would be useless. 
Even dreaming of seeing a ghost was an omen of 
sickness and death, and caused much worry 
among people having such dreams. 

Medicine 

The Choctaws had several classes of 
dignitaries among them. Some of them were held 
in the highest reverence: The Medicine Man (or 
Prophet), the Rain Maker, and the Doctor. The 
doctors made use of herbs and roots in various 
forms, applied and given in different modes for 
emetics, cathartics, sweats, wounds, and sores. 
They also made use of cold baths, scarification, 
supping, and blistering by means of burning punk. 
Some used enchantment, white others practiced by 
magic, purporting to have learned the art of healing 
... by special revelation. Choctaws now refer to 
these distinguished persons as m Alikchi? or doctors, 
and do not use the term medicine man. 

The medicine men were familiar with several 
plants which were used for cures for common 



diseases. For example, most knew a sure cure for 
the bite of the rattlesnake. A plant called 
"Rattlesnake Master* was used in making a poultice 
which was applied to the snakebite. The patient 
also chewed the root. 

Rattlesnake grease was used for rheumatism. 
Indian women swallowed a concoction of rattle- 
snake rattles in the belief that it v/ould help them 
through childbirth without pain. 

Counterirritants were used as a remedy for 
severe pains in the stomach or for rheumatic pains. 
Above the seat of pain, they pressed a piece of 
cotton or similar substance into the flesh. This was 
about the size of a small pea and was bumed in 
that position. 

When the Choctaw was wounded by a bullet 
or arrow, the medicine man first sucked tho wound, 
then spat out the Wood. He used root powder to 
dry and heal the wound and to prevent infection. 
No lint or compress was used in dressing the 
wound. 

For toothaches, the Choctaws chewed the 
bark of the buttonbush. Bark of the prickly aeh was 
placed in a cavity to stop the pain of a toothache. 

Choctaws made use of steam cabinets into 
which were boiled all sorts of sweet-smelling herbs. 
Vapor filled with essence and salts of these herbs 
entered the patients body through pores, and 
through his nose. Strength was thus restored. This 
cured many malfunctions, including the effects of 
overeating. 

Boiled bayberry leaves were used for treatment 
for fever. Sometimes beaten elder leaves were 
combined with salt to cure headaches. 

The flowering ash or "private tree" had bark 
with an antiseptic quality. The bark was boiled In 
water and the extract was used to bathe wounds. 

Miscellaneous remedies were numerous. 
Mullein leaves were also used to make a poultice 
for headaches. Pine pitch was mixed with grease 
and tallow to make a salve for treating wounds 
resulting from splinters and thorns. The inside bark 
of pine saplings made an effective medicine for 
diarrhea. Rabbit tobacco, (called "life everlasting" by 
the whites) was made into an infusion and was 
drunk in cases of fever. It was also used as a 
tobacco substitute. 

Jerusalem oak, or wormseed, was made into 
a kind of candy and fed to children to get rid of 
worms. Pink root was added to whiskey and used 
as a tonic to drive out fever and to "build up the 
system." It was weakened and sugar was added 
when it was given to children. 

Equal parts of honey, butter, and the juice of 
the green vines and leaves of the pole bean were 



252 2 67 



steamed together very slowly until the mixture skin cancer. Persons using the cancer cure were 
formed a soft salve. The salve was used to cure to refrain from use of alcoholic beverages and fats. 



EVALUATIONS: 1 . What does the word shilup mean to the Choctaws? 

2. Who took care of the Choctaws when they became sick? 



PRAYER FANS 

Feathers are one of the instruments of 
traditional forms of worship and meditation, one of 
the symbols of a reverence for life for many Indian 
tribes. 

Because of the Golden Eagle's great strength 
and courage, the American Indian admired this bird 
and prized his feathers above all other adornments. 
The thirteen taH feathers of the adult bird were 
considered to possess great medicine. 

Prayer fans are used in the religious 
ceremonies of many Indian tribes. They can be 
quite elaborate or very simple. The following 
description fits those made by one Oklahoman 
whose work is widely known: 

"Macaw, giant hornbHI and assorted tropical 
feathers with removable handle beaded in gourd 
stitch with 'cut 1 beads, buckskin fringe, 24 inches 
long."

Provide for each student a copy of the background materials on Pete Miller. 
Engage the students in a discussion of the function of the medicine man. If 
you have Indian students in the classroom, have them tell what they know 
about the medicine man. Perhaps they could get additional information from 
their parents and/or grandparents. Above all, do not take lightly the function 
of the medicine man in the tribal structure and do not treat his work as 
witchcraft. 



After discussing the role of the medicine man, give each student a list of 
plants used by him. At this point, you might like to teach your students how 
to key and classify these plants from the list that are found in your area. This 
should be followed by a field trip to collect as many types of medicinal plants 
as they are able. The plants collected should then be mounted for display. 

BACKGROUND: 



Mr. Pete Miller, a retired Seminole Nation 
medicine man of the Bear Clan, lives a quiet serene 
life with his wife, Helen, in a small white-frame 
house near Strothers in Seminole County. Mr. 
Miller, 80 years old [in 1976], has been a medicine 
man since he was 15 years old. His father was a 
medicine man before him. 

At the age of 15, his father took him to a small 
tent which had been erected beside the North 
Canadian River to teach him the science ^nd art of 
becoming a medicine man. 

Huge stones, which had been heated in red 
hot coals, were placed In a pit inside the tent. 
Equipped only with Indian medicine, herbs, leases, 
roots, and buttons, they entered the tent unclothed, 
and completely sealed the tent. Thus began four 
days of fasting, drinking only the prepared 
medicine. The medicine was also poured over the 
heated stones to turn the tent into a steam bath. 



During the four day stay, Mr. Miller's father taught 
him many chants and the medical usages of the 
various leaves, wild flowers, roots, herbs and 
buttons. At noon, suntime, the fourth day, they 
emerged from the tent, dipped four times in the 
North Canadian River and at exactly high noon, 
they scratched themselves with a needle dipped in 
the prepared medicine, then broke the fast- 
Once more they entered the tent and repeated 
the same ritual, emerging the 5th day to complete 
the training for the year. However, not all is learned 
at one time and yearly the lessons were repeated. 

The medicine man is not only called upon for 
curing physical ailments, but also to alleviate pain 
and suffering caused by loss of loved ones and 
other mental anguish suffered by his fellow man. 

When preparing liquid medicine for various 
purposes, Mr. Miller goes to a specific place deep 
in a wooded area about two miles from his home. 



254 Â£6.9 



This area is located near an ancient cemetery plot 
where many of his former family members are 
buried. 

Facing the east, Mr. Miller sits down by a pot 
where various ingredients are crushed by a specific 
medicine stick and mixed with water. He then uses 
another medicine stick which is about two or three 
feet long and hollow, to blow through and mix the 
ingredients. This Is done rhythmically and precise- 
ly. Before the process begins, a special colorful 
scarf is placed beside the pot to ward off any 
germs present in the area. 

One medical preparation is used as part of the 
ritual of burying the dead. The coffin is lowered 
half-way into the grave, then the members of the 
family and friends sprinkle a bit of earth on the 
coffin signifying a last hand-shake. After the burial 
is completed, the medicine man walks around the 
grave four times sprinkling the special medicine. 
He then departs the burial ground and goes to 
the home of the deceased. He walks around the 
outside of the home four times again sprinkling 
the medicine. Entering the home the same ritual is 



again repeated. This is to keep the loneliness and 
heartbreak away from the family. 

A stickball game requires great strength of the 
arms and legs and much fortitude. Therefore, 24 
hours before a game, short splints of tree bark and 
tied around the knees to strengthen the knees. The 
day of the game each player dips in a pool of water 
which has been fortified with a special medicine. 
Each player also drinks some of the medicine for 
strength. 

During the time Mr. Miller Is administering to 
the sick patients, he fasts for four days at a time, 
indulging only in a liquid concoction. Each time 
the fast is broken at noon, suntime, the fourth day. 
If the patient is not fully recovered, he again fasts 
for four days while administering medicine to the 
patient. Chants are also an integral part of the 
proceedings. 

Mr. Miller, a humble, conscientious man, has 
devoted his life to service to others who need him. 
Besides his duties as a medicine man, Mr. Miller 
has served many years previously as a pastor at an 
Indian Church southwest of Okemah.

8. State the organizing generalization in their own words. 

The level of specificity will be determined by the teacher in terms of depth of 
involvement, level of maturity, and appropriateness of responses. 

1. Drawing paper, construction paper, and/or colored cloth scraps 

2. Crayons, colored chalk, and/or paint 

3. Modeling materials, i.e./clay, dough, papier-mache, or plaster 

4. Chart paper 

5. Resource books 

6. Audiovisual materials (if available) 



PROCEDURE: 



Have the students make a picture of 
themselves doing something they especially like to 
do. Let them share what it depicts and why they 
like to do it.. Prepare a list of these activities. 
Discuss why these are important and how they feel 
when they are doing them. 

Following this discussion, ask them to add 
someone to their picture they would especially like 
to share in this experience. Attempt to get them to 
include someone not of their immediate family. 



Take into account any particular kinship or 
relationship patterns that may be Indigenous to 
your community. Let them tell who they added and 
discuss why they were selected if they wish or are 
able to verbalize these feelings. Discuss the term 
"friend" and guide them toward making a 
generalization that friends are important to us. 

Let them pair off and dramatize doing 
something with a friend. Discuss whether it is more 
fun to do this alone or with a friend. Why or why

not? Pose the question: "If having a friend to work 
or play with makes you feel good, do you think 
your friend feels good when he has you to work or 
play with?" 

There are several good films and filmstrips 
pertaining to these ideas. Viewing one or more of 
these, if available, will help students clarify and 
objectify ideas that have been discussed. ("Fun of 
Making Friends," Coronet Films; "We Play and 
Share Together," Bailey Films, Inc.; "Little Things 
That Count," Eye Gate House). 

Plan a cooperative activity, e.g., relay games. 
Minimize team competition by rewarding each te*.m 
equally. At the conclusion, discuss roles of 
individuals as related to team objectives. Other 
questions might be "Is our room a good place to 
work and play? Why or why not?" "How can we 
make it a better place?" Discuss housekeeping 
tasks and assignments and their importance. 

Ask the students if giving cjmething to 
someone makes them feel good. Do those who 
get the gift feel good toward the giver? How is it 
useful to others? Let students share their feelings, 
experiences, and understandings of the "give-away" 
at pow-wows, benefit dances, or ceremonials. 
Guide them toward seeing this as traditional 
behavior if it does not surface during the 
discussion. 

Write a chart story including cooperation and 
conflict. Encourage students to express their 



feelings about various acts. Show the film 
"Kindness to Others" (Coronet Films), if available, 
and discuss how the things we say affects the 
feeiings of others. List the responses, minimizing 
reading problems by putting them on different 
colored paper slips so that students can recognize 
the color code. Let them draw a slip randomly and 
act out the feeling. After role playing, discuss how 
the audience feit when these moods were 
portrayed. 

Let children project undesirable ways of 
behaving, conflict, or negative feelings through 
modeling figures and using them to create various 
situations. Observe children's responses and 
actions for leads to follow-up activities. 

Discuss and review previous discussions. Let 
children dictate their summary of points learned. 
Help them relate these to earlier lessons about 
family roles. Guide them toward developing the 
generalization upon which the lesson was based, 
letting them dictate it in their own words. Have 
them put it and their pictures in their "Who Am I?" 
booklet. 

A culminating activity might be a dramatization 
for another class or for parents; an exhibit of 
books, pictures, and figures created; a shared work 
experience such as assisting the custodian; or a 
fieid trip to observe adult friends working or playing 
together. 



BACKGROUND: identity is a very frequent problem for many Indian students. Although 

everyone deals with identity crises with varying degrees of success, the 
autonomy allowed Indian children, certain cultural patterns of behavior, 
historically destructive policies and acts by the dominant culture, and 
concomitant paternalistic activities and attitudes have served to Intensify 
these crises for many Indian youth. Teachers who are aware of these factors 
and who are informed concerning the interrelationships and results of these 
factors may effectively assist their students in gaining increasing confidence 
and ability to find identity and acceptance in diverse contexts. This may be 
done through a systematic offering of inductively- oriented opportunities to 
examine the self in personal, social, and cultural situations that focus upon 
analysis, comparison, and generalization as ways of learning. This example 
is illustrative of an early lesson in such a series. Its primary purpose is to 
help students formulate the generalization that when we work, play, and 
interact with friends, we discover and learn to know who we are. it is 
designed to follow exploration of family roles, sibling relationships, etc. 

EVALUATION: Observation of students' behavior throughout the progress of the lesson will 

enable the teacher to ascertain achievement of the objectives. A simple 
checklist would provide for easy recording of individual attainment and 
growth.

FOLLOW-UP: Continuing with the "Who Am I? " format, design a similar series of activities 

that center around the student identifying self In the community. 

Resource people from the community could be brought in, especially chiefs, 
headsmen, agency workers, tribal officers, and PHS personnel. Engage 
students in attempts to identify with adults In war mothers and service clubs, 
social societies, and church groups. Explore adults' vocational, avocational, 
recreational, and personal interests and activities. Introduce outstanding or 
well-known figures, both contemporary and historical, through literature, films 
and storytelling. 



OKLAHOMA'S INDIANS TODAY 



Oklahoma is the melting pot of Indian America. 
Oklahoma has the largest Indian population of any 
state in the Union. Many questions are asked as to 
the definition of H an Indian. 14 There is no general 
legislative or judicial definition of M an Indian" that 
can be used to Identify a person as such. For 
census purposes, they have been identified on a 
self-declaration basis. 

Thirty-seven (37) federally-recognized tribes 
now inhabit the state. Descendants of the original 
67 tribes who were in Indian Territory (most of them 
relocated here from other areas) still live in 
Oklahoma, but some do not total a sufficient 
number to make up a tribe. 

Indians of Oklahoma and Indians from 
out-of-state keep alive their heritage through 
authentic tribal celebrations and powwows, art, 



drama, music, and literature. Many of these 
performances and annual events are planned for 
the Indian people as religious, cultural or 
recreational events. 

Sometimes the meaning cf the contemporary 
ceremonials are confusing to non-Indians, and even 
to the younger generation of Indians who have lived 
apart from Indian ways and do not fully understand 
the tribal ceremonials or speak the tribal language. 

An upsurge of pride in Indian heritage is being 
expressed. More effort is being made to enrich the 
contemporary ceremonials with verbal and written 
interpretations so that the basic beliefs of Indian 
people may be kept alive. Indian events In 
Oklahoma are scheduled annually from early spring 
through late fall.

SOCIAL STUDIES 
(Indian Groups in Oklahoma Today - Grades 4 and 5) 



OBJECTIVES: 



Upon completion of this lesson, students will be able to: 



MATERIALS: 



1. Relate certain facts about the tribe or location about which they have 
read or discussed. 

2. Identify the names of a specific number of Oklahoma tribes, when 
presented orally and/or graphically, and to locate on a map of the state 
the general area in which significant numbers of people from these 
tribes live. 

3. Correct!'* atch tribal names with pre-statehood reservation areas within 
an accuracy range determined by the teacher. 

4. Exhibit an increasingly positive attitude towards their own ethnicity. 

1. Various newspapers published throughout the state (date published is 
not important; wide geographical representation is desirable) 

2. Colored feit tip markers 

3. Outline maps of Oklahoma 

4. Reference map of Oklahoma (wall or atlas type) 

5. Reference books 



PROCEDURE: 



Attempt to ascertain students knowledge of 
other tribes in the state through discussion, oral 
quizzes or pencil and paper quizzes. Open-ended 
introductory questions might be used to help 
students begin to think about the situation. For 
example, students may be asked, "Have you ever 
heard of the tribe that live in and about the 

community of T (Choose an example 

at some distance removed from the student's 
community if possible.) M How many different tribes 
do you think are represented in our state?" "What 
are some of the names of tribes of your friends and 
acquaintances?" "How can we find out about the 
tribal composition of other states?" 

Divide students into small groups according to 
the number of newspapers available. Give each 
group a paper or papers and two colored markers. 
Each group should elect a recorder. Ask students 
to examine the papers carefully In order to identify 
any items or articles containing news about Indians 
or Indian tribes. Articles are marked for easy 



identification later. Possible tribal and community 
place names should be underlined (context clues 
may help students tentatively identify these), and 
the recorder should compile a list of these. 

Using a wail map or atlas, help each group 
discuss their tentative lists of place names. Provide 
opportunity to discuss and research tribal names 
and to relate these to former reservation areas. 
After they have exhausted their own Ideas and 
approaches, provide any additional data from your 
own background and reading. Assist them in 
formulating and refining an accurate list and in 
relating people to areas. 

Provide indivkJuai outline maps and iet 
students prepare a demographic map of tribes and 
weli-known communities associated with each. 
They should be allowed to elaborate upon their 
own areas. Incorporate material relative to former 
reservation areas or provide additional outline 
maps. Have students compare and contrast these 
data. 



262 



277 



As a culminating activity, the whole class may 
collaborate in constructing a large map. These 
could be made on paper, cardboard, plywood, etc., 
depending upon purpose, time available, and 



materials available. This would make an excellent 
project for using papier-mache, fe!t, clay, salt and 
flour, or sawdust and paste to model this map. 



BACKGROUND: Most Indian students in our State are aware of their own tribal identity and 

usually of contiguous tribes or of those with which they have been historically 
associated. Many are less familiar, however, with the great variety of cultures 
that have become part of Oklahoma's rich Indian heritage. This lesson is 
designed to serve as a first step in helping Indian students develop an 
awareness and an appreciation of this diversity and realistically appraise the 
role of their own tribe in today's social context. Al'hough primarily aimed at 
intermediate level students, it can be easily adapted for students of different 
levels of ability. For example, older, more sophisticated students might go 
beyond state boundaries to examine the question on a national basis. 

EVALUATION: Observe students in their discussion sessions throughout the project, 

especially in the small groups formed. Note the breadth, quality, and 
approach taken to gather and organize data. Give each student an 
opportunity to respond to oral and/or written questions posed in terms of the 
lesson's purpose. Provide opportunity for practice and restudy of difficulties 
individual students encounter. Note interactions and strategies developed 
during culminating activity. Allow the students an opportunity to evaluate the 
project and their own learning and feelings in writing or orally. 

ENRICHMENT: Some students may wish to extend their study to include brief tribal histories, 

census data, the names each tribe calls itself, antecedent tribal territories or 
locations, and/or the order of arrival in the state. Map puzzles and word 
puzzles may be constructed to incorporate cognitive knowledge contained 
in the lesson. Students may desire to interview readily available persons 
from other tribes or to invite them to talk with the class. Biographies of 
noted individuals from the several groups may be examined. Some may 
wish to learn to spell the names of the different tribes. Interested students 
may wish to associate the tribes with their broader linguistic group. 

FOLLOW-UP: Student responses to such questions as, "Have al! of these tribes always 

lived in Oklahoma?" "How did all of these groups come to be located in 
Oklahoma?" "Where did they originally live?" "Have you heard the term 
'Indian Territory?- "Why do you think there are no longer any reservations 
in Oklahoma?" "Are there other tribes living in other parts of the country 
today?" and "Do any people belonging to your tribe live somewhere besides 
Oklahoma?" may provide indication for the most appropriate direction. One 
may wish to initiate a bilingual study of a particular group or area; a broad 
survey of two or more contrasting cultures (woodlands group compared with 
plains group) or language groups (Choctaw compared with Chickasaw), a 
more nationally oriented study in terms of a commonly shared cultural 
characteristic, or an historical examination dealing with cause-and-effect and 
oral tradition. 

The range of opportunities for further study is quite wide. The suggestions 
given here are by no means exhaustive. The Imaginative teacher can easily 
modify, build upon, and improve these in terms of students' needs and 
Interests.

A look at Indian names should have greater 
impact and meaning if students study the Indian 
names in their own state, county and community. 
Gather these names, their correct pronunciations, 
and their meanings, if available. These may be 
used in a variety of ways. Examples: 

1. Make maps using these place names. 

2. Gather historical information relative to a 
specific name for individual reports or 
group discussion. 

3. Use as creative writing stimuli for narrative 
of how name might have originated. 

This sample lesson deals with teaching the 
names of four towns in Seminole County that have 
Seminole-Creek names. These names are shown 
with the English and Seminole-Creek spelling. This 
activity could be used as a lesson in Oklahoma 
History, Social Studies, Language Arts or Indian 
Awareness. It should be adaptable for grades 4-9. 

Procedure for the activities : 

1. Tell the students that the Indian has made 
contributions to Oklahoma in arts, crafts, 
foods, social customs, and political structure. 
Many of the names for lakes, rivers, 
mountains, and towns in Oklahoma have 
Indian names. The following are some of the 
towns in Seminole County which have 
Seminole-Creek names. (See activity 4 
below.) 

2. Display a map of Oklahoma showing its 77 
counties. 

3. Use a picture which shows an enlargement of 
Seminole County. Place on the map some of 
the towns having Seminole-Creek names. 

4. Konawa, Sasakwa, Seminole and Wewoka. 

a. Konawa - Ku-na-wv (beads or necklace) 

b. Sasakwa - Sa-sv/c-wv (goose or geese) 

c. Seminole - Se-mv-nchle At one time the 
word was used to mean wild as in the 
word 7o se-mu-no-le u (wild bee) 

d. Wewoka - We-woh-kv From the words 
n uewf (water) and *woh-k\f (to bark - 
roaring or barking water) 

5. Pronounce the words for the students. Use 
pictures to go along with the words. At this 



time, teach the word *tv-lohf (town). Have 
the students name the Seminole-Creek town 
that has the same meaning as the picture or 
items below: 

â€¢ Necklace or a string of beads for the word 
Konawa. 

â€¢ Picture of a goose for the word Sasakwa. 

â€¢ Picture of a Seminole Indian for the word 
Seminoie. 

â€¢ Picture of a river running with full force 
and water falls for the word Wewoka. 

6. Explain to the students that Wewoka is the 
capital of the Seminole Nation just as 
Washington, D.C., is the capital of the U.S. 

7. Seminole is the home town of former 
Governor David Boren. 

8. Sasakwa is the hometown of former 
Seminole Nation Chiefs George Harjo, 
John Jumper and John Brown. 

10. The OG&E Electric plant located at 
Konawa supplies electricity for thousands 
of homes in Oklahoma. 

Utilize local expertise of Native American teacher 
assistants, parents and tribal leaders for correct 
pronunciations. Culturally related activities dealing 
with traditions and other Indian names should add 
new dimensions for classroom activities. 

Creek-Seminole names for other towns and 
counties in Oklahoma with English and 
Creek-Seminole spelling are shown below : 

â€¢ Eufaula - tyu-fa-la) tribe - an independent body 
of the Creeks. 

â€¢ Muskogee - (Maskoke) - another name for the 
Creek tribe. 

â€¢ Okfuskee - (afuske) - in a point. 

â€¢ Okmulgee - (uew or ovw mulke) - bubbling 
water. 

â€¢ Weleetka - (uewv or ovw letka) - running 
water. 

â€¢ Wetumka - (uewv or owv tumkr) - tumbling 
water.

The State Flag oÂ» Oklahoma. f>^â„¢X^^^^^ 
buckskin shield surrounded by a sky blue field. â„¢ e * n ^Â° s 9â„¢ d wjth six ainted 

seven pendant eagle feathers. 

Superimposed on the face of the shield 
are a calumet, or peace pipe, and an olive 
branch. The peace pipe is the Indian symbol 
of peace and the olive branch the white 
man's symbol of peace. Together they sym- 
bolize the love of peace on the part of a unit- 
ed people. 

The State name was added to the bottom 
of the flag in 1941. "Oklahoma" is a combi- 
nation of two Choctaw words: ok/a meaning 
"people" and homma meaning "red."
