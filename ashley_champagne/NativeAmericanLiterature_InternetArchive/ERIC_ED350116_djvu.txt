ABSTRACT 

This bibliography includes materials that supplement 
an original 1980 edition. As in the earlier edition, this 
bibliography provides teachers and librarians with information about 
instructional materials related to North American Indians, Inuit, and 
Metis. Information is categorized into three sections titled after 
the three groups. Each section contains print and audiovisual 
materials. Each entry includes the library call number, the authors, 
the publisher, the date of publication, and an annotation. Whenever 
possible, grade level is indicated as early years, senior years, or 
research/teacher references. Print materials for each section cover 
all or most of the following topics: (1) arts: (2) autobiographies 
and biographies; (3) contemporary society and historical society; (4) 
culture groups; (5) education; (6) history; (7) literature; (8) 
native languages; and (9) religion and mythology. Audiovisual 
materials include filmstrips, slides, videotape recordings, pictures, 
and kits. An index by title is included. This bibliography provides 
information on criteria for identifying and evaluating bias in 
instructional materials; a glossary of terms pertaining to evaluation 
of bias; information on the Manitoba Education and Training Library; 
and an explanation of procedures for borrowing materials listed in 
this bibliography. (LP)

CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING BIAS 



It is recognized that exposing students to a variety of controversial issues 
and opinions can be a valuable learning experience. Therefore, not all 
materials which contain negative biases have been eliminated from this 
bibliography. Teachers are urged, however, to preview all materials to 
determine their suitability. The following guidelines are designed to 
assist in identifying biases involving culture, religion, sex, age, and 
physical and mental capacities. For convenience and ease of reference, 
these guidelines have been divided into two broad sections which include 
several categories. 

I Historical Accuracy and Balance ^ 
Concreteness and Inclusiveness 

1. (a) Texts should identify the source of information wherever 

statements purport to be factual, in order to minimize edit- 
oralizing, generalization, vagueness and eimbiguity. In the 
event that original source material is unavailable, students 
should be made aware that the view presented is an interpret- 
ation of the facts. 

(b) Where actual documents are available, reference should be 
made to them with special attention being given to present- 
ation of different points of view, should these exist. 

2. Accounts of a particular event should clearly indicate that they 
reflect the perceptions, attitudes, language, concerns and setting 
of the times referred to. 

3. The subject matter should be dealt with in a balanced way in order 
to cover multiple aspects of the event or situation including the 
contributions of various people or groups and their popular or 
unpopular positions, different cultural approaches, controversial 
viewpoints, varying roles and occupations. 

4. Subject matter specifically dealing with vocational and occupa- 
tional roles should provide information about as wide a spectrtira 
of opportunities available in society as is possible, with 
specific care to avoid the presentation of sex-typed occupational 
categories .

Department of Education, 1973.

II Comprehensiveness and Unity 
Language and Realism 

5. In order to reduce the danger of attributing selected characteris- 
tics of an individual to the total group of which that person is a 
part, adjectives, or phrases descriptive of the htaman character 
should relate to an identifiable person rather than to an identi- 
fiable group of persons. 

6. Where a particular group of persons is described in an account, 
the information should be presented in a complete and meaningful 
way rather than in a fragmented or scattered fashion. 

7. Pictures and illustration3 should be congruent with the coverage 
allocated to the persons or events discussed, supported by 
appropriate captions of the pictures' locations, times and dates r 

8. Slanting by way of value laden words or labels should be avoided. 

9. Illustrations and written material must not perpetuate stereo- 
types about people based upon race, religion, creed, nationality, 
ancestry, ethnicity, sex, color, age, culture. 

10. Social evils, including prejudice and discrimination, should be 
examined rather than ignored. Current and past events should 
receive frank and realistic treatment. Matters of broad social 
concern, whether regarded as negative or positive, should not be 
omitted or ignored but should be identified and explored. 

11. Illustrations in texts should reflect the wide variety of 
individual differences within all segments of our society. 

12. The language and terms used should accurately describe 
individuals, groups, and situations. They should not reinforce 
questionable attitudes or assumptions about people.

CRITERIA FOR IDENTIFYING BIAS 



When analyzing the content of instructional material, the following criteria 
may be employed to identify forms of bias. 

1. Bias by omission ; selecting information that reflects credit on only 
one group, frequently the writer's group. 

2. Bias by defamation ; calling attention to the faults and ignoring the 
virtues of an individual or group. 

3. Bias by disparagement ; denying or belittling the contributions of an 
identifiable group of people in the Canadian culture. 

4. Bias by cumulative implication ; constantly creating the impression 
that only one group is responsible for positive development. 

5. Bias by (lack of) validity ; failing to ensure that information about 
issues is always accurate and unambiguous. 

6. Bias by inertia ; perpetuation of myths and half-truths by failure to 
keep abreast of historical scholarship. 

7. Bias by obliteration ; ignoring significant aspects of the history of a 
cultural or minority group in Canada. 

8. Bias by disembodiment ; referring in a casual and depersonalized way to 
the historical role of identifiable cultural and minority groups. 

9. Bias by (lack of) concreteness ; dealing with a cultural group in 
platitudes and generalizations (applying the shortcomings of one 
individual to a whole group). To be concrete, the material must be 
factual, objective, and realistic. 

10. Bias by (lack of) comprehensiveness ; failing to mention all relevant 
facts that may help the student to form an opinion.

Authors usually focus attention on Mexican 
weaving, pottery, lacquer, and basketry, to the 
exclusion of the disappearing art of toy- 
making. The Mexican folk toy had its origins 
among the Indians of Mexico, and because folk 
toys did not take on the flavour of Spanish 
arts, they continue to reflect the culture and 
heritage of the Native people. This well- 
illustrated book will appeal to people of all 
ages, although the accompanying text is 
suitable for older students.
