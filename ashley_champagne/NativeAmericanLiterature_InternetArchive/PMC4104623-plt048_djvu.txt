Abstract. Physiological ecology and plant functional traits are often used to explain plant invasion. To gain a better 
understanding of how traits influence invasion, studies usually compare the invasive plant to a native congener, but 
there are few conspecific examples in the literature. In North America, the presence of native and introduced genetic 
lineages of the common reed, Phragmites australis, presents a unique example to evaluate how traits influence plant 
invasion. We reviewed the literature on functional traits of P. australis lineages in North America, specifically contrasting 
lineages present on the Atlantic Coast. We focused on differences in physiology between the lineage introduced from 
Eurasia and the lineage native to North America, specifically seeking to identify the causes underlying the recent expan- 
sion of the introduced lineage. Our goals were to better understand which traits may confer invasiveness, provide pre- 
dictions of how these lineages may respond to interspecific competition or imminent global change, and provide 
guidance for future research. We reviewed published studies and articles in press, and conducted personal communica- 
tions with appropriate researchers and managers to develop a comparative dataset. We compared the native and intro- 
duced lineages and focused on plant physiological ecology and functional traits. Under both stressful and favourable 
conditions, our review showed that introduced P. australis consistently exhibited greater ramet density, height and 
biomass, higher and more plastic relative growth rate, nitrogen productivity and specific leaf area, higher mass specific 
nitrogen uptake rates, as well as greater phenotypic plasticity compared with the native lineage. We suggest that eco- 
physiological and other plant functional traits elucidate potential mechanisms for the introduced lineage's invasiveness 
under current and predicted global change conditions. However, our review identified a disconnect between field 
surveys, experiments, natural competition and plant ecophysiology that must be addressed in future field studies. 
Given the likelihood of hybridization between lineages, a better understanding of plant traits in native, non-native 
and hybrid lineages is needed to manage current invasions and to predict the outcome of interactions among novel 
genotypes. Comparative physiology and other plant functional traits may provide additional tools to predict the 
trajectory of current and potential future invasions.

Introduction 

Plant invasions threaten biodiversity and ecosystem ser- 
vices worldwide (Vitousek et al. 1997). Numerous studies 
have investigated plant invasion by comparing non-native 
species with closely related native congeners, and subse- 
quently relating plant invasiveness to the differences in 
plant traits among the species compared (McDowell 
2002; Deng et al. 2004; Drenovsky et al. 2012; Caplan 
and Yeakley 2013). A potential issue with this approach 
is that congeneric comparisons can be confounded by 
phylogenetic differences (Harvey 1996). Although not 
always possible, the ideal approach for assessing how 
strongly plant traits contribute to invasiveness would 
minimize phylogenetic differences, specifically by using 
conspecific individuals that are present in the same geo- 
graphic range. In North America, multiple conspecific 
lineages of the common reed, Phragmites australis (here- 
after Phragmites), co-exist (Saltonstall 2002). This pro- 
vides a unique opportunity to identify the heritable traits 
and ecophysiological differences that may contribute to 
invasion success. 

Cosmopolitan in distribution (Haslam 1972), P. australis 
is one of the most studied wetland plants due in part to its 
perceived benefits and threats to ecosystem services. In 
North America, Phragmites is often considered a nuisance 
species (but see Kiviat 2013) as invasion results in a loss of 
habitat (Chambers et al. 1999; Weinstein and Balletto 
1999), reductions in species richness and diversity 
(Chambers etal. 1999; Bertness etal. 2002) and alterations 
to biogeochemical cycles (Windham and Lathrop 1999; 
Meyerson etal. 2000; Windham and Ehrenfeld 2003). Else- 
where, Phragmites is either managed or preserved for 
shoreline stabilization (Benner et al. 1982), faunal 
habitat (Poulin et al. 2002) or building materials (Haslam 
2010). It is also an important species in wetland-based 
wastewater treatment systems (Vymazal et al. 2006; 
Brisson and Chazarenc 2009). 

Phragmites australis consists of dozens of distinct 
genetic lineages (Saltonstall 2002), seven of which are 
found in North America (Saltonstall 2002; Meyerson 
et al. 2012). While the genus Phragmites has a history of 
gene flow (Lambertini et al. 2012), North American 
genetic lineages have been geographically separated for 
millennia. The relatively recent introduction of the 
Eurasian lineage (haplotype M) most likely occurred in 
the 19th century (Saltonstall 2002). Historically, the 
North American native subspecies (P. australis subsp. 
americanus; hereafter 'native Phragmites') (Saltonstall 



2002) was considered to be a minor component of both 
tidal and non-tidal wetlands throughout North America 
(Marks et al. 1994; Chambers et al. 1999). The cryptic inva- 
sion of P. australis subsp. australis, or haplotype M (here- 
after 'introduced Phragmites'), threatens a wide range of 
habitats across North America, including tidal fresh wet- 
lands (Rice et al. 2000), brackish wetlands (Windham 
and Lathrop 1999; McCormick et al. 2010b), salt marshes 
(Silliman and Bertness 2004), fens (Richburg et al. 2001), 
roadside ditches (Brisson et al. 2010) and freshwater 
coastal wetlands (Tulbure et al. 2007; Tulbure and 
Johnston 2010). Recent work has also identified four add- 
itional lineages of Phragmites along the North American 
Gulf Coast, including a hybrid between the Gulf Coast 
native lineage (P. australis subsp. berlanderii) and the 
introduced Eurasian lineage (Lambertini et al. 2012). 

The presence of conspecific lineages of Phragmites 
along the Atlantic Coast of North America provides a 
unique opportunity to identify the heritable traits that 
confer success to invasive plants. Past research has 
demonstrated that multiple introductions of Phalaris 
arundinacea resulted in increased genetic variation and 
contributed to invasion in the introduced range (Lavergne 
and Molofsky 2007). Earlier studies of Phragmites in Europe 
identified population- and/or clone-specific differences in 
plant phenotype and physiological traits (Rolletschek et al. 
1999; Lessmann et al. 2001; Hansen et al. 2007). However, 
until recently, it was not possible to attribute these differ- 
ences to a particular genetic lineage. Current molecular 
tools now provide a framework to assess ecological ques- 
tions based on evolutionary history, potential speciation 
due to geographical separation and/or hybridization 
(Meyerson et al. 2010; Lambertini et al. 2012). In North 
America, the introduced Eurasian lineage (haplotype M) 
is generally considered to be invasive and responsible for 
the increased dominance of Phragmites throughout 
the North American wetlands. At the same time, native 
Atlantic Coast lineages are in decline (Saltonstall 2002). 
Owing to separations in flowering phenology (which limit 
hybridization) and lack of intermediate morphological 
forms (Saltonstall 2003, 2011), intraspecific lineages 
can be used to understand which plant traits may confer 
invasiveness. 

Physiological plant traits and responses to abiotic condi- 
tions can influence the spatial distribution of plants from 
the species to the population level (Chapin and Oechel 
1983; Reich et al. 1999; Lavergne and Molofsky 2007). 
When identifying plant traits that may confer invasiveness,

Mozdzeret al. — Ecophysiological differences between native and introduced Phragmites 



spurious interpretations can be avoided by restricting con- 
trasts to those within genera or species. Previous studies 
have shown that differences in traits such as maximum 
photosynthetic rate (A max ) (Lavergne and Molofsky 2007; 
Mozdzer and Zieman 2010), specific leaf area (SLA) 
(McDowell 2002; Mozdzer and Zieman 2010) and relative 
growth rate (RGR) (Vasquez et al. 2005) can greatly in- 
fluence the ability of a plant to be successful under a 
variety of environmental conditions. Here we use a litera- 
ture review to identify key differences in plant ecophysiol- 
ogy, intraspecific competition and responses to global 
change factors that distinguish North American native 
from introduced lineages (haplotype M) of the common 
reed, P. australis. We also highlight areas of future research 
necessary to understand interactions in the field with 
regard to intraspecific and intrageneric competition. 

Methods 

We reviewed the peer-reviewed literature and unpub- 
lished theses that directly compared native and intro- 
duced Phragmites lineages, and conducted interviews 
with individuals involved in Phragmites research and man- 
agement. We only included studies that focused on native 
and non-native lineages along the Atlantic Coast, where 
clear genetic differences between the lineages had been 
demonstrated (Saltonstall 2011). We excluded work prior 
to 2002 in our review because the native and introduced 
lineages were typically not differentiated prior to that 
date. To take into account potential differences in abiotic 
environment, experimental set-up and differences in 
propagule source (seed versus rhizome), we relativized 
data for each trait by calculating the per cent difference 
between the two lineages. This was specifically calculated 
as the mean trait value of the introduced lineage minus 
the mean trait value of the native lineage, divided by the 
mean trait value of the native lineage, and multiplied by 
100. Positive values indicated a greater advantage to the 
introduced Phragmites and negative values indicated a 
greater advantage to the native Phragmites. For data 
obtained from field studies we calculated mean ramet 
density (ramets rrT 2 ), leaf area per ramet (cm 2 ramet -1 ), 
ramet height and aboveground biomass (g nrT 2 ). When 
published data were available, we also calculated mean 
SLA (cm 2 g~ a ) and mean nitrogen productivity (NP; RGR 
per unit gram of nitrogen). 

Results 

Comparative morphology 

While ramet densities varied, mass per ramet and mass on 
a ground area basis were always greater in the introduced 
lineage. Introduced Phragmites produced from 15 to 



191 % more biomass under field conditions and from 69 
to 286 % higher biomass under experimentally controlled 
conditions (Table 1). There were no instances where the 
native type produced more biomass than the introduced 
type. Such differences are due to plants being taller 
under both field (6-30%) and experimental (14-49 %) 
conditions (Table 1); i.e. they support a larger photosyn- 
thetic canopy (36-38 % under field conditions (Table 1) 
and 14-314 % under experimental conditions (Table 2)). 

Mean ramet densities of the introduced lineage were 
significantly higher than those of the native lineage 
(Fig. 1) in both field and experimental settings (Tables 1 
and 3), although ramet densities were highly variable for 
both lineages. Even when the densities of the native and 
introduced Phragmites are similar, ramets of the intro- 
duced lineage are most often taller (Table 1, Fig. 1). In 
the field, ramets were 6-10 % taller, and had a 36-38 % 
greater leaf area per ramet (Table 1). Density was also 
greater in introduced versus native Phragmites (95- 
322 %) in growth chamber experiments where carbon 
dioxide (C0 2 ) and nitrogen (N) were manipulated 
(Table 3). In addition, introduced plants were 13-20% 
taller (Table 3) in both field and manipulative experiments. 

Canopy differences 

Phenotypic differences in colour and canopy structure are 
indicative of physiological differences. Native Phragmites 
is characteristically yellow-green in colour, whereas the 
introduced lineage is more blue-green in colour through- 
out North America (Blossey 2002; Mozdzer and Zieman 
2010; Swearingen and Saltonstall 2010). In Atlantic 
Coast populations, the characteristic yellow-green 
colour of the native lineage was related to it having 
143 % lower chlorophyll content and 14 % thicker leaves 
(lower SLA) (Table 1) than the introduced lineage 
(Mozdzer and Zieman 2010). We report anywhere from 
12 to 80 % lower light-saturated rates of photosynthesis 
Wmax) (Table 4) than the introduced population due to 
lower chlorophyll content and lower SLA (Mozdzer and 
Zieman 2010) translating into the observed lower RGR 
(Vasquez et al. 2005; Mozdzer and Megonigal 2012). 
Given the consistently observed phenotypic differences 
among North American native populations, it is likely 
that differences in photosynthetic physiology are similar 
across North American native populations. 

Investment in both light-harvesting capacity (leaf area 
ramet -1 ) and fast growth (SLA and RGR) differentiates 
the two lineages. The introduced lineage had a 14-33 % 
greater SLA, and this difference in SLA is consistent 
among populations for plants grown under field experi- 
mental conditions (Tables 1 and 2). Consistent with 
theory (Ceulemans 1989; Westoby 1998), increased SLA 
also corresponds to higher RGRs (10-116 %; Table 2) of

the introduced lineage under current and predicted ele- 
vated C0 2 and N pollution conditions. In addition, on a 
per ramet basis, introduced Phragmites had anywhere 
from 36 % to over 300 % greater leaf area than the 
native type (Tables 1 and 2). While both lineages have 
high photosynthetic rates (Mozdzer and Zieman 2010), 
the introduced lineage has anywhere from 12 to 80 % 
greater rates of photosynthesis per unit leaf area 
(Table 4). To illustrate the potential ecological significance 
of these photosynthetic rates on potential plant growth, 
we used data on mean ramet density, mean size of the 
photosynthetic canopy and mean photosynthetic rates 
(Table 1 and Fig. 1) to calculate stand-scale photosyn- 
thesis rates. Assuming full light penetration to all leaves 
on an individual plant, we found that the introduced 
lineage would fix 83 % more C0 2 per ramet per second 
(Fig. 2) than the native lineage. By taking into account 
the Phragmites density per unit area, our analysis suggests 
that introduced Phragmites has the potential to fix 112 % 
more C on a stand scale than native Phragmites (Fig. 2). 
These differences are compounded by phenological differ- 
ences in senescence, as the introduced lineage has the 
potential to photosynthesize for weeks to months longer 



than the native lineage (Meyerson et al. 2010; Mozdzer 
and Zieman 2010). Congruent with greatercarbon fixation 
potential and higher SLA, the introduced lineage consist- 
ently exhibited a greater RGR (Table 1) than the native 
lineage under a range of conditions (Vasquez et al. 2005; 
Mozdzer and Megonigal 2012). 

Belowground 

Only a few studies have investigated belowground differ- 
ences between native and introduced Phragmites, yet 
trait differences associated with belowground allocation 
have the potential to magnify differences in growth poten- 
tial. The non-native lineage had a greater ratio of below- 
ground : aboveground biomass, allocating 46-89 % more 
biomass belowground both proportionally and in absolute 
terms under ambient nutrient conditions (Table 2). The 
belowground : aboveground ratio was not significantly 
different under N treatment when plants were grown 
from seed (Table 3), but when grown from rhizomes, the 
introduced lineage allocated 54-100% more biomass 
belowground than did the native lineage (Table 3). Of 
this belowground allocation, Mozdzer and Megonigal 
(2012) reported that the introduced lineage allocated

proportionally more biomass to both roots (root mass frac- 
tion) and rhizomes (rhizome mass fraction) than the 
native lineage. Thus, higher rates of nutrient acquisition 
and clonal expansion may come from greater resource al- 
location belowground to both rhizomes and roots. 

Nutrient uptake, plant N demand and N metabolism 

A study comparing the partitioning of glutamine synthe- 
tase (GS) activity, a proxy for nitrogen use efficiency 
(NUE) (see reviews by Oaks 1992; Andrews et al. 2004), 
demonstrated that the leaf/root partitioning of GS activity 
of a Phragm/tes-dominated habitat was the highest 
recorded in a natural system. Although there was no sig- 
nificant difference between Phragmites lineages, both 
had among the highest leaf/root GS activity measured in 
land plants, scoring higher than transgenic plants that 
were modified to express this trait (Hazelton et al. 2010). 
The comparably high NUE was reflected in several 
studies that have shown similar vigour and assimilation 
of N at low concentrations (Holdredge et al. 2010; 
Mozdzer et al. 2010; Mozdzer and Megonigal 2012). Both 
lineages have higher affinities for ammonium when com- 
pared with dominant tidal wetland plants and both use 
multiple forms of organic N. Phragmites australis may 



therefore have access to a pool of nutrients that is not 
used by competing plants (Mozdzer et al. 2010). While 
both lineages have high affinities for N, native Phragmites 
has a higher affinity for NHt , but uptake rates saturate at a 
lower N concentration (Mozdzer et al. 2010). Thus, under 
low nutrient conditions, both lineages would be expected 
to perform equally well (Holdredge et al. 2010; Mozdzer 
et al. 2010). However, as anthropogenic N loading 
increases, the advantage clearly shifts to introduced 
Phragmites (Holdredge et al. 2010; Mozdzer et al. 2010), 
as demonstrated by the greater vigour relative to the 
native lineage for all measured traits and metrics (Table 3). 

Mozdzer and Megonigal (2012) found that only the intro- 
duced lineage, and not the native lineage of Phragmites, 
can alter its N metabolism to match a variety of N availabil- 
ity conditions. In particular, under low N availability, the 
introduced lineage changes plant NP, an integrative 
term of nutrient use efficiency, dramatically altering N 
metabolism to match growing conditions. In contrast, 
the native lineage has a nearly static NP for low-N environ- 
ments. Data from the Vasquez et al. (2005) study reveal the 
same pattern (Table 4), with the introduced Phragmites 
exhibiting a greater NP under ambient and high-salinity 
conditions.

were calculated from the studies that appear in Table 1. The number of studies summarized in (A) -(D) was n=3, n=3, n=6 and n = 2, 
respectively. 



Global change effects 

The most striking differences between the North American 
native and introduced lineages are when they are experi- 
mentally exposed to global change factors such as an- 
thropogenic N pollution, elevated C0 2 or salinity. In 
particular, introduced Phragmites had a greater physio- 
logical and morphological plasticity under both stressful 
and resource-rich conditions, resulting in its designation 
as a 'Jack-and-master' strategist (Mozdzer and Megonigal 
2012). Because of this greater plasticity, introduced Phrag- 
mites had a greater density with added N (85-168 %), sal- 
inity (873 %) and elevated C0 2 (193-322 %); introduced 
plants are 13-20 % taller and have 182-201 % greater 
leaf area per ramet (Table 3). As a consequence of 
increased density, height and leaf area, the introduced 



lineage produced anywhere from 151 to 250% more 
total biomass (aboveground + belowground) (Table 3). 
Of the biomass produced, the introduced lineage allocated 
54-100 % proportionally more belowground (Table 3). 

Discussion 

Physiological ecology and invasiveness of the 
introduced Phragmites 

Our review confirms that introduced and native Phrag- 
mites lineages differ both physiologically and morpho- 
logically. Introduced plants are generally taller and occur 
in greater densities, which results in greater productivity 
in the introduced lineage in nearly every study. The taller 
and denser canopies (Meadows 2006; Mozdzer and

Zieman 2010; Mozdzer and Megonigal 2012) and thick 
litter layer (Holdredge and Bertness 2011) in stands of 
the introduced lineage cumulatively result in reduced 
light availability. The introduced Phragmites may also 
transmit oxygen to rhizomes and roots more efficiently 
(Tulbure et al. 2012), a feature that would potentially give 
it a belowground competitive advantage by ameliorating 
the anaerobic rhizosphere of saturated soils. As a conse- 
quence of its greater biomass, introduced Phragmites may 
be more effective at immobilizing N; thus it may limit the N 
available to competitors (Meyerson et al. 2000; Windham 
and Meyerson 2003) or facilitate invasion through competi- 
tive exclusion (Holdredge and Bertness 2011). 



The higher ramet density of the introduced lineage, 
observed in both field and experimental settings, suggests 
differences in clonal strategies. The introduced lineage ini- 
tially spreads through guerilla growth, sending out individ- 
ual stolons. It then transitions to phalanx growth, resulting 
in the formation of dense patches that exclude other vege- 
tation (Windham and Lathrop 1999; Amsberry eta/. 2000). 
In contrast, the native lineage does not always exhibit 
phalanx growth, as demonstrated by the fact that native 
Phragmites stands are interspersed with other species 
(E. L. G. Hazelton and V. Douhovnikoff, pers. comm.). The 
production of a greater number of tillers by the invasive 
lineage results in a higher ramet density and biomass

per unit area, which thereby increases its potential for in- 
vasion (Holdredge et al. 2010). 

Given the consistent phenotypic differences in North 
American native populations, we hypothesize that differ- 
ences in photosynthetic physiology are similar across 
North American native populations. We base this on the 



fact that the native population has lower A max rates com- 
pared with the introduced population, which is due to 
lower chlorophyll content and lower SLA (Mozdzer and 
Zieman 2010) translating into a lower RGR (Vasquez 
et al. 2005; Mozdzer and Megonigal 2012). More common 
garden and field studies are needed, especially across

multiple populations and study sites, to validate this 
observation with regard to potential differences in 
chlorophyll content, accessory pigments and SLA. 

Increased light-harvesting capacity (leaf canopy per 
ramet) and higher growth rates (SLA and RGR) are indica- 
tive of underlying physiological strategies. In particular, 
the greater and plastic SLA and higher RGR of introduced 
Phragmites have been suggested as factors driving its 
invasion (Mozdzer and Zieman 2010; Mozdzer and 
Megonigal 2012). Although leaf-level photosynthetic 
rates respond immediately to local environmental condi- 
tions (Lessmann et al. 2001), traits such as SLA, which 
combine physiological and biochemical processes, are 
slower to respond (Callaghan et al. 1992) and are excellent 
predictors of potential plant growth (Ceulemans 1989). 
While the lower SLA of the native lineage should confer 



some resistance to herbivory, herbivory by invertebrates 
seems to be greater on native populations (Lambert and 
Casagrande 2007; Lambert et al. 2007), suggesting that 
the decreased SLA did not evolve for herbivory defence. 
Lower SLA could be attributed to an adaptation for 
slower growth under nutrient-limited conditions, where 
plants invest more in longer-lived structures. 

The greater resource allocation belowground (to both 
rhizomes and roots) in the introduced lineage may result 
in both higher rates of nutrient acquisition and high 
rates of clonal expansion, contributing to both growth 
and clonal expansion. Historically, clonal integration and 
resource sharing were prominent hypotheses used 
to explain the invasiveness of introduced Phragmites 
(Amsberry et al. 2000). However, given the recent findings 
of high within-patch genetic diversity (McCormick et al. 
2010a, b), and different potential growth strategies 
between native and introduced Phragmites (E. L. G. 
Hazelton and V. Douhovnikof, unpubl. data), more re- 
search is needed to conclusively determine the import- 
ance of resource sharing, and whether there are 
differences among native and introduced lineages. Re- 
source sharing andagreaterabilityto efficiently exchange 
gases between aboveground and belowground organs 
(Tulbure etal. 2012) may provide a mechanism to facilitate 
establishment and expansion in environments such as salt 
marshes that have pronounced stress gradients and limit 
plant distributions. 

Our review showed that both Phragmites lineages are 
adapted to N-limited environments, and that both 
lineages have a similar high-affinity transport system, 
which is an adaptation to N limitation (Crawford and 
Glass 1998). However, the difference in performance 
under high N indicates that the introduced lineage may 
be shifting to a more efficient low-affinity transport 
system than the native lineage. The ability to respond to 
changing nutrient conditions has been suggested as one 
of the competitive advantages of the introduced Phrag- 
mites, while the native lineage becomes N saturated and 
is not able to exploit eutrophic conditions (Mozdzer et al. 
2010). Yet, the introduced Phragmites is not at a complete 
disadvantage in low-N environments, due to its plastic N 
productivity (Mozdzer and Megonigal 2012). These studies 
indicate that the vigour of introduced Phragmites will in- 
crease with anthropogenic nutrient pollution, and provide 
evidence that the competitive ability of introduced Phrag- 
mites may be linked to plastic nutrient use strategies 
under lower nutrient availability. 

Taken together, the physiological and other functional 
trait advantages of the introduced lineage (greater 
density, ramet height and biomass, higher RGR and SLA, 
and high N uptake under high anthropogenic N loading) 
are major factors driving its invasiveness in North America.

Mozdzer et al. — Ecophysiological differences between native and introduced Phragmites 



Competition between native and introduced 
Phragmites 

The overall superior performance of introduced Phrag- 
mites suggests that it would outcompete the native Phrag- 
mites in mixed populations. Indeed, the increase in 
abundance of introduced Phragmites with the concomi- 
tant decrease in the native one at the landscape scale is 
often interpreted as being the result of direct competition 
(Saltonstall 2002; Lelong et al. 2007). However, processes 
other than competitive exclusion may result in similar pat- 
terns. For example, a disturbance causing the removal of 
native Phragmites may facilitate the establishment of 
the introduced lineage. In such cases, better dispersal, es- 
tablishment and expansion of introduced Phragmites, and 
not direct resource competition, would be responsible for 
the observed shift in relative abundance at the landscape 
scale. 

If competitive exclusion occurs, the most direct field evi- 
dence would come from the contact zone of adjoining 
native and introduced stands. Competitive outcomes 
would be revealed by the spatial dynamics at that 
contact zone over time as one lineage progresses to the 
detriment of the other. Such studies remain rare, and 
their results are inconclusive or contradictory. In a study 
in the Lac Saint-Francois Reserve of southern Quebec, 
five contact zones of neighbouring stands growing in 
freshwater wetlands were surveyed for up to 5 years 
(S. de Blois et al, unpubl. data). The survey did not reveal 
a clear pattern of progression of the introduced over the 
native lineages, or that the introduced patches were in- 
creasing over the course of the survey. Instead, there 
were variations in progression or regression between 
sites and between years, with only a slight (and non- 
significant) net advantage for the introduced lineage. 
Meadows (2006) surveyed five transects crossing the 
contact zones in each of two cases of adjoining stands of 
native and introduced Phragmites in Delaware. During 
the 2 years of the survey, there appears to have been an in- 
crease in the relative density of the native lineage over the 
introduced lineage in the 'mixed' zone of one site and a 
small decrease in the native lineage at the other site, al- 
though interannual changes in density for either lineage 
were not significant. Meadows (2006) also measured the 
expansion rate of adjoining stands of native and intro- 
duced Phragmites located in a different Delaware site. 
Comparing the position of the most distant culm outside 
the leading edge of the stands positioned the previous 
year, he found that the introduced stand expanded by 
1.11 m, while the adjoining native stand contracted or 
was displaced by 1.59 m. 

Classical garden orgreenhouse competition experiments 
using seedlings or transplants, with various combinations 



of mixed and pure populations, represent the most direct 
approach to evaluate competitive interaction between 
two plant species (Gibson et al. 1999; Holdredge et al. 
2010). We found one such study in our review; Holdredge 
et al. (2010) transplanted native and introduced Phragmites 
plants to a common field, and manipulated both the iden- 
tity of competitors and fertilization. Although they found no 
evidence of suppression of the native lineage after 2 years, 
their results suggest that, under high-nutrient conditions, 
the invasive lineage would displace the native lineage 
over time by producing more biomass and expanding at a 
faster rate. 

In a mesocosm competition experiment, S. de Blois etal. 
(unpubl. data) compared the expansion of native or intro- 
duced Phragmites grown in one half of the mesocosms 
into the opposite, competitor-occupied half, as well as 
expansion into mesocosms with unoccupied (control) 
halves. While the absolute performance of introduced 
Phragmites in terms of biomass and ramet density was 
superior to the native one under all circumstances, there 
was no statistical difference in the overall percentage of 
decrease in performance caused by the presence of the 
competitor. For example, expansion into the opposite 
compartment 1 year after a central panel was removed, 
as measured by aboveground biomass, was approximately 
65 % lowerfor both subspecies in competition mesocosms 
compared with the control. By producing more biomass 
and a larger number of culms, the results nonetheless 
suggest that the relative competitive effect of the intro- 
duced Phragmites on the native one would increase over 
time. Because a decline in the native lineage has been 
related to an increase in the introduced lineage, there 
is still a need for more experimental research on 
competition between the lineages in order to clarify the 
conditions that may lead to competitive exclusion. 

Responses to global change factors 
(anthropogenic N pollution and C0 2 ) 

Our review finds that introduced Phragmites is a 
'Jack-and-master' of change, which is a similar character- 
ization to that of a super weed (Baker 1965). In other 
words, the introduced lineage outperforms the conspecific 
native lineage under both stressful and resource-rich 
conditions. Inherently higher RGRs, greater and plastic 
SLA, and plastic NP are suggested to be the physiological 
mechanisms unique to the introduced lineage that enhance 
its invasive ability under current and future conditions 
(Mozdzer and Megonigal 2012). More research is needed 
to elucidate the reasons behind the greater plasticity 
and ecological fitness of introduced Phragmites. 
Whether its plasticity and fitness are related to a 
history of multiple introductions (Hauber et al. 2011),

Mozdzeret al. — Ecophysiological differences between native and introduced Phragmites 



hybridization (Freeland et al. 2010; Meyerson et al. 2010; 
Lambertini etal. 2012) or evolution of increased competi- 
tive ability (Blossey and Notzold 1995) is still unclear (but 
see Guo et al. 2013). This focus area would greatly 
benefit from an investigation of heritable changes in 
gene expression via an epigenetic approach (Nicotra 
et al. 2010). 

Our literature survey suggested that introduced Phrag- 
mites will continue to expand its range and become 
more abundant in response to continuing change in the 
global environment. In particular, anthropogenic N pollu- 
tion benefits the introduced lineage; it has a stem density 
that is 181 % higher, produces 85-171 % more biomass 
and has ramets that are 13-20 % taller under elevated N 
(Table 3). In addition, N had profound effects on the intro- 
duced lineage by producing a canopy with 200 % greater 
photosynthetic area (Table 3). These differences in growth 
can be attributed to the greater N uptake capacity of the 
introduced lineage (Mozdzer et al. 2010) coupled to a 
greater allocation belowground for nutrient acquisition 
(Tables 2 and 3). Plastic NP (Mozdzer and Megonigal 2012) 
may be the underlying cause for the disproportionate re- 
sponse under current and predicted N availabilities. This is 
congruent with correlations of introduced Phragmites ex- 
pansion throughout New England (Bertness et al. 2002) 
and Chesapeake Bay (King et al. 2007; Chambers et al. 
2008) with anthropogenic N pollution. 

As C 3 plants, both Phragmites lineages should benefit 
from elevated C0 2 (Ainsworth and Long 2005). In growth 
chamber experiments (Mozdzer and Megonigal 2012), 
both lineages responded positively to elevated C0 2 . 
However, the introduced lineage had the greatest 
biomass response to C0 2 , which was about 45 % greater 
than the control treatment. This suggests, but does not 
demonstrate, that it is likely that elevated C0 2 will also 
favour the introduced genetic lineage in the field. Else- 
where, only a handful of studies have investigated C0 2 
responses in Phragmites. Neither the growth chamber 
study on Phragmites japonica or Phragmites communis 
(Kim and Kang 2008) nor field experiments with Phrag- 
mites within a Sphagnum peatland (Milla et al. 2006) 
demonstrated any significant effects of elevated C0 2 on 
Phragmites growth. It is most likely that the elevated C0 2 
growth response in Kim and Kang's (2008) study was 
limited by pot volume, which is a well-documented phe- 
nomenon (Thomas and Strain 1991). A mini-FACE experi- 
ment in Europe by Milla et al. (2006) concluded that 
vascular plants in peatlands, including Phragmites, are 
not very responsive to elevated C0 2 . The lack of C0 2 re- 
sponse by Phragmites in the mini-FACE study was likely 
attributable to the C0 2 concentration at the position of 
the tall Phragmites canopy being close to ambient levels 
and/or a combination of nutrient limitation and 



immobilization by the Sphagnum layer (Milla et al. 2006). 
Alternatively, it is also possible that the introduced Phrag- 
mites lineages in North America are physiologically differ- 
ent from those in Eurasia. 

In short-term studies, rising C0 2 and anthropogenic N 
pollution seem to benefit the introduced lineage with 
respect to both expansion and establishment. In particu- 
lar, the introduced lineage outperformed the native 
lineage for every measurable metric (Table 4); the intro- 
duced lineage exhibited a more plastic NP and SLA and 
an inherently higher RGR (Richburg et al. 2001) The intro- 
duced lineage also exhibits a 'Jack-and-master' pheno- 
typic and physiological plasticity (sensu Richards et al. 
2006), suggesting that it had greater ecological fitness 
under both stressful and resource-rich conditions. These 
results suggest that the introduced lineage will only 
become more competitive in the future. 

Conclusions 

Given the high genetic diversity within native and intro- 
duced Phragmites populations (McCormick et al. 2010a; 
Saltonstall 2011), the underlying question is what 
caused the introduced lineage to become so invasive in 
North America? Our review clearly identifies gaps in our 
knowledge. Additional studies are needed to determine 
whether there has been an evolution of increased com- 
petitive ability (Blossey and Notzold 1995) given potential 
physiological differences between North American and 
Eurasian populations. An alternative explanation is that 
there has been gene flow among North American native 
and introduced populations that made the introduced 
lineage more invasive and/or plastic than it is outside of 
North America. Given the amount of gene flow recently 
demonstrated in Gulf Coast populations (Saltonstall 
2011; Lambertini et al. 2012), and the discovery of new 
genetic lineages (Lambertini et al. 2012), this possibility 
should be further evaluated. 

Finally, our review shows that direct studies of competi- 
tive interactions between the native and the introduced 
Phragmites are few, and that conclusions from the labora- 
tory and field observations do not always concur. The 
assumed superiority of introduced Phragmites does not 
necessarily hold in mixed or adjoining populations under 
pristine conditions, and inconclusive or even opposing 
results have occasionally been observed. Certainly, more 
experiments or surveys of adjoining populations are 
necessary to examine how physiological and morpho- 
logical characteristics translate into a competitive advan- 
tage of the introduced lineage over the native Phragmites 
when they are naturally co-occurring. Acknowledging the 
disconnect between laboratory and field observations, we 
still observe profound differences in response to global

Mozdzer et al. — Ecophysiological differences between native and introduced Phragmites 



change factors such as C0 2 and N pollution. Thus, our ana- 
lysis of comparative ecophysiology and functional traits 
allows us to predict its likely trajectory. Given the differen- 
tial response of native and introduced Phragmites, we hy- 
pothesize that the competitive advantage will shift to 
more strongly favour the introduced lineage, especially 
when competition is coupled with anthropogenic N pollu- 
tion and rising C0 2 .
