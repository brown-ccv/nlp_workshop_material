ABSTRACT 

A study was conducted at Prince George's Community 
College (PGCC) in Maryland to determine the percentage of students 
enrolled in courses in fall 1987 who received passing grades, and to 
examine these pass rates with respect to academic discipline, and 
student gender, age, race, and admission status. Study findings 
included the following: (1) the overall pass rate was 73.4%, 
representing the highest collegewide fall course pass rate in 12 
years; (2) female students achieved an overall pass rate of 76%, 
compared to 69% for males; (3) though women had higher pass rates 
than men in every instructional division, the gender difference was 
especially pronounced in English studies, in which the pass rate of 
women was 13% higher than that of men; (4) students over 25 years of 
age had a higher pass rate than students under 21; (5) White students 
had a pass rate of 77%, compared to 74% for Asian, Hispanic, and 
Native American students and 69% for Black students; (6) pass rates 
for continuing students rose from 73% in 1981 and 74% in 1985 to 76% 
in 1987; (7) occupational courses had higher overall pass rates than 
general education or developmental studies courses; and (8) 
disciplines with the highest pass rates were nursing (93%), 
hospitality services management (88%), and English literature (86%), 
while disciplines with the lowest pass rates were developmental 
mathematics (55%), mathematics (56%), and chemistry (58%). (EJV)

COURSE PASS RATES IN FALL 1987 
Enrollment Analysis Report 88-6 
March 1988 



Introduction 

This report presents an updated analysis of course pass 
rates, one of three primary approaches used at PGCC to measure 
credit student achievement « The three approaches are: 

li Within-term Course Pass Rates: Analysis of the 
percentage of Initial course enrollees who successfully 
complete courses* 

^•^^ 

2. Tera-to-tem Retention: Analysis of the peT.'^centage 
of students enrolled in a given term who return for 
classes the following term. 

3. Retention through Program Completion: Analysis of 
the percentage of degree-seeking students who graduate 
within a given time period. 

This report summarizes within-term student achievement analyzed 
in terms of course pass rates in fall 1987. The overall pass 
rate (percentage of initial enrollees receiving grades of A, 
C^ TP^ and audit) for fall 1987 was 73.4 percent. This 

was the highest collegewide fall course pass rate in twelve 
years « Fall semesters over the 1977-86 period recorded pass 
rates of 71 or 72 percent. 

The remainder of this analysis reports variations In pass rates 
by several student characteristics, including gender, age, race, 
admission status, and academic divisions and disciplines. 
Figures from similar analyses in fall 1981 and 1985 are included 
for comparison* 



Women More Successful than Men 

Female students achieved an overall pass rate of 76 percent 
in fall 1987, seven percentage points higher than that of male 
students* Women did bettor than men in both general education 
and occupational coursewcrk. These gender differences were 
similar to those found in the earlier studies, as shown in the 
following table: 



Course Pass Rates by Gender 



FALL 1981 FALL 1985 FALL 1987 

Enrolled Passed Enrolled Passed Enrolled Passed 

Women 21,704 74% 17,642 75% 18,042 76% 

Men 17,642 68% 13,793 68% 13,466 69% 

Women had higher pass rate averages in every instructional 
division. The gender difference was especially pronounced in 
English studies, where women had a divisional pass rate nearly 13 
percentage points above that of men (see Table 1). 



Older S tudents More Successful than Younger Students 

As in the two earlier pass rate studies, older students had 
higher course pass rates than younger students. in fall 1987 
students over age 25 had an overall pass rate ten percentag4 
points above that of students imder age 21: «- » 

Course Pass Rates by Age Group 

FALL 1981 FALL 1985 FALL 1987 

Enrolled Passed Enrolled Passed Enrolled Passed 

Under 21 14,159 71% 14,547 69% 14 904 70% 

Over 25 12,492 75% 9,319 78% 9;i61 80% 

Older students did better in both general education and 
occupational courses. As Table 2 shows, students over age 25 
achieved higher average pass rates than younger students in most 
disciplines. An notable exception was English as a Foreign 
Language, where students under age 21 had the highest pass rate! 



White Students Mo re Successful than Minority Students 

course pass rates by race revealed that minority 
?qS2 Lff*' ^ell as a group than white students in fall 

io II '^f ! students had a pass rate of 77 percent, compared to 

blacks and nearly 74 percent for Asian, Hispanic, 
and Native American students (the program that produces th4 
report used in this analysis did not distinguish among the latter 
three groups). Course pass rates by race for fall i98l 1985 
and 1987 are shown in the following table:

Other 2,360 72% 2,257 70% 2; 327 74% 

While vhlte students had higher fall 1987 pass rates than blacks 

in most disciplines, as shown in Table 3, the gap in most cases 
was smaller than it had been six years ago. 



Continuing Stude nts More Successful than New Students 

Students with experience at PGCC had an average pass rate 
nearly eight percentage points above that of students new to the 
college. In fall 1987, over three-fourths of the continuing 
student enrollments resulted in a passing grade, compared to only 
two-thirds of the new student enrollments:

Continuing student pass rates were higher in most disciplines as 
shown in Table 4. A notable exception was in English 
composition, where new students had a pass rate nearly three 
percentage points above that of continuing students.

Course Pass Rates by Divisions and Disciplines 

Occupational courses had higher overall pass rates than 
courses in general education or developmental studies: 

Course Pass Rates by Academic Area 

FALL 1981 FALL 1985 FALL 1987 

Enrolled Passed Enrolled Passed Enrolled Passed 

Gen. Ed. 24,350 71% 19,142 71% 19 50C 73% 

Occup. Ed. 11,924 74% 9,621 75% 9 091 78% 

Dev. Ed. 3,072 63% 2,186 66% 2,457 64% 



The higher success rate In occupational courses was found In each 
of the groups examined; for each classification by gender age 
race, or admission status, higher pass rates were achieved In 
occupational courses than In general education classes. 

Course pass rates were computed for each Instructional 
division. Health Technology courses in nursing and allied health 
continued to have the highest pass rates:

Analysis of pass rates by individual disciplines revealed a 
wide range of student success (see Table 5). Of those 
disciplines enrolling at least lOO students in fall 1987 eleven 
had pass rates at least 10 percentage points above the 
collegewlde average: 

Disciplines with High Pess Rates, Fall 1987 



1. Nursing 93% 

2. Hospitality Services Mgt. 88 

3. English Literature 86 

4. English as a Foreign Language 85 

5. Business 85 

6. Law Enforcement 85 

7. Health Education 85 

8. Paralegal Studies 84 

9. Early Childhood Education 84 

10. Art 84 

11 . Marketing 84 

Three disciplines had pass rates more than 10 percentage points 
below the college average: 

Disciplines with Low Pass Rates, Fall 1987 

1. Developmental Mathematics 55% 

2. Mathematics 56 

3. Chsmlstry 58%

These three disciplines have consistently been the most difficult 
for PGCC students. That a substantial number of students coming 
to the community college are seriously deficient in mathematical 
skills and background seems a reasonable Inference. 



Subgroup Analysis 

What groups had the most difficulty completing coursework? 
A four-way crosstabulatlon of the race, age, gender, and 
admission status variables generated pass rates for 36 different 
student subgroups (see Table 6). Three subgroups had pass rates 
more than 10 percentage points below the collegewlde average of 
73 • ^« 



Demographic Subgroups with Low Pass Rates, Fall 1987 

1. New black males under 21 55.1% 

2. New white males under 21 63.1 

3. New white males age 21-25 63.2 

The three subgroups most at risk shared several characteristics: 
they were new to college, male, and young. These subgroups had 
more difficulty with general education courses than with 
occupational courses, as shown in Tables 7 and 8 in the appendix. 

^ *. .^o P/ovide associate deans and department chairpersons 
detailed Information of course pass rates in their areas, five- 
way crosstabulations adding division or discipline to the race 
age, gender, and admission status variables were run. These 
detailed data have been distributed as separate, supplementary 



Summary 

This report has examined course pass rates by several 
demographic descriptors available on student record files as 
well as by academic divisions and disciplines. It has identified 
subject areas and student subgroups with course pass rates 
differing from the collegewide average. Many variables that 
* impact on course success were not on the database used to 

generate this analysis. Socio-economic background, prior 
educational experiences, employment demands, individual 
motivation, and other factors could be posited as plausible 
causal variables. None were available for inclusion in this 
analysis. As the college expands its efforts to assess student 
achievement, it may need to Improve its database of entering 
student characteristics to include new data elements, such as 
high school performance indicators. (For example, it might be 
useful to know the extent of students' prior mathematics 
coursework.) Last October, the research office conducted a

survey of first-time college students entering PGCC in fall 1987 
which included several questions to fill in some of the gaps in 
our entrant database. Of course, the information gained will be 
limited to the subset of this cohort that responded to the 
survey a subcommittee of the college's Task Force on 
institutional Assessment has recommended additionti to the data 
required at application, so that the college will systematical Iv 
gather more information about its entering student population. 
As the subcommittee said, "to better evaluate student 
achievement, we need to know more about students when they first 
enter the college." While counselors and advisors often obtain 
and use such information, it needs to be entered on a student 
record file so it will be available for subsequent, systematic
