Central Florida Community College 



ABSTRACT 

In 1996, Central Florida Community College (CFCC) 
participated in the American Association of Community Colleges' 
Exploring America's Communities project, which works to strengthen 
the teaching and learning of American history, literature, and 
culture at U*S* community colleges. CFCC's principal goals were to 
promote conversation among faculty about American identity and to 
assist in carrying these discussions into the classroom. The primary 
mechanism for implementing the program was a series of faculty "brown 
bag" round table discussions, which addressed issues regarding 
immigration to America, American identity, and textbooks. The 
program's other main accomplishments were: an Interdepartmental 
Discussion Session, where a speaker addressed the entire faculty, 
challenging the college to encourage the college to continue to 
grapple with the question of American identity; a film series, 
including two movies about Mexi can-Amer icans and Native Americans; 
the creation of two new courses introducing multicultural education; 
and curriculum revisions for two humanities courses, which were 
expanded to include identity and diversity issues* The only obstacle 
the program faced was that a plan for a nationally recognized 
key-note speaker was not implemented due to a lack of funds* Future 
events include several speakers, discussions, and art and literary 
exhibitions. (HAA)

I CENTRAL FLORIDA COMMUNITY COLLEGE 

Central Florida Community College was established in 1958 and now serves about 
6,000 credit students with approximately 30,000 involved in non-credit programs. Our 
three campuses in the tri-county area of Marion, Levy, and Citrus counties serve a largely 
rural population of approximately 332,000. Our main campus is in Ocala (selected the 
fifth best place to live in the U.S. by Money Magazine in 1995). In addition to three 
campuses, CFCC boasts several venues offering cultural events as well as instruction: 
the CFCC Exhibit Center hosts traveling exhibitions and lectures; the Brick City Center 
for the Arts is a focal point for visual and performing artists; and the Appleton Museum 
of Art (jointly owned with Florida State University), a large art museum with an extensive 
collection of western and non-western art. 

II. GOALS OF THE PROJECT 

Our principal goals were to promote conversation among CFCC faculty about 
American identity and to assist in carrying these discussions into the classroom. The 
primary mechanism was a series of faculty "brown bag" round table discussions. 

III. ACCOMPLISHMENTS 

A. Brown Bag Discussion Series 

The faculty "Brown Bag" sessions proved a great success. At the first session, 
Humanities Instructor John Mathews offered a historical sketch of 19th- and 20th-century 
immigration to America. Adjunct History Instructor Darrell Riley discussed varying 
conceptions of American identity over the past two centuries. Finally, Education Instructor 
Jana Bernhardt presented examples of how history textbooks have changed in the past 
century.

At the second session, Cornrnunications Instructor Debra Vazquez outlined 
America’s rich literary heritage and pointed up the fact that not only is there a multitude 
of talented Asian-, African- and Latino-American authors currently working in this country, 
but that there has been for centuries. Also, by having those present read several short 
works, she demonstrated that questions of pluralism and identity are profoundly expressed 
by these authors. 

In the third session, Humanities Instructor Ron Cooper used audio recordings to 
show that the presence of similar musical structures within American vernacular styles 
illustrates the borrowing among poor, rural musicians and songwriters of varying ethnicity. 
Communications Instructor Joe Zimmerman used D. W. Griffith's The Birth of A Nation 
to exemplify how American film, even from one of our most gifted filmmakers, has 
perpetuated racial stereotypes. 

The series drew fifteen to twenty faculty members to each session, and each was 
video taped for viewing and discussion on our other campuses. One luncheon was 
attended by CFCC’s new president during his first week on campus. 

B. Interdepartmental Discussion Session 

In another key segment of our faculty development element of the project, Dr. 

Daniel Rivas of Saddleback College addressed the entire faculty and challenged the 
college to continue to grapple with questions surrounding American identity in all 
disciplines. After his address, Dr. Rivas joined the members of the Humanities 

& Social Sciences and Communications & Fine Arts Divisions for a prolonged discussion. 

C. Film Series 

This years CFCC Film Series included Mv Family (1995), about several 
generations of a Mexican-American family's successful struggle to survive in Anglo- 
American dominated society, and Powwow Highway (1988), about the picaresque 
exploits of a young Native American and his white companion. Both films were followed 
by discussions led by CFCC faculty members.

D. New Courses 

Two new courses were created. "Introduction to Multicultural Education" will be a 
prerequisite for admission to the educational departments at Florida's nine state 
universities. Topics include exploring American commonalities as well as appreciating 
our differences. The second new course, "Introduction to Children's Literature," includes 
an examination of American identity in a multicultural society. 

E. Curriculum Revision 

Two courses were revised by the addition of new materials. HUM 2450: American 
Humanities took "Search for Identity: Common Ground Within Diversity" as a guiding 
theme of the class. Students collaborated to produce a mural that will adorn a wall of the 
Student Lounge on the CFCC Citrus Campus. In addition, Diane Ravitch's The American 
Reader , a multicultural anthology, was added to the required reading for American 
Humanities. Also, Patricia Osborne’s Finding America: The American Experience 
lO Multicultural Literature is being considered for use in AML 2022: Survey of American 
Literature II. 

IV. OBSTACLES 

Our plan for a key-note speaker of national recognition to address the entire 
faculty was not implemented due to a lack of funds. 

V. FUTURE EVENTS/REMAINING GOALS 

In the spring of 1997, two series of events connected with the project will take place 
on campus: "Florida's Literary Heritage" will be a series of appearances and discussions 
by Florida writers, including Lola Haskins (poet and historian of 19th-century Florida 
women), Roberto Fernandez (author of humorous and insightful novels of Cuban-Floridians) 
and Stetson Kennedy (pioneering folklorist and author of several books about the KKK 
and other hate groups). 

In April there will be a series of lectures and panel discussions devoted to the theme 
"Intolerance and Understanding." These will complement the traveling exhibition "Anne

Frank in the World" at the CFCC Exhibit Center. 

VI. RESPONSES OF STUDENTS AND COLLEAGUES 

There was no clear widely-accepted sense of what it means to be an American, 
other than our perception of ourselves as Americans. If anything, there was a feeling of 
E Pluribus . Pluribus . but we're still Americans, nevertheless. 

The question of what divides us was easier to answer. The most frequent 
responses were color, class, ignorance of each other and fear. 

Regarding what we have in common, students and faculty alike emphasized our 
shared political institutions (the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. 

Constitution), our economic institution of free-market capitalism tempered with 
government regulation, and our cultural institutions (with far more emphasis on the 
popular arts and mass media than on the fine arts and literature). 

What brings us together? Most mentioned was the belief that despite the 
differences, we were still Americans. As one student said, "With all our differences, 
we're still an 'us'!"
