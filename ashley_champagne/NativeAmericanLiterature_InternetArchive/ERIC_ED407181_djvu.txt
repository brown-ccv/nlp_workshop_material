ABSTRACT 



This digest provides information to help teachers gain a 
better understanding of Asian- American children, particularly those from East 
and Southeast Asian cultures, and identify culturally appropriate educational 
practices to use with these children, Asian -Americans represent more than 29 
distinct subgroups who differ in language, religion, and customs. In addition 
to these between-group differences, diversity exists within national groups 
and among individuals. Nevertheless, Asian- Americans are generally 
stereotyped as successful and high-achieving minorities. The "whiz kid" image 
of Asian-American students that is described in popular and professional 
literature is a misleading stereotype that masks individuality and conceals 
real problems, in reality, for many Asian-American students, the challenge of 
American schooling can be overwhelming. Some students have learning 
difficulties and some lack motivaticn, proficiency in English, or financial 
resources. Teachers can better understand their Asian-American students by 
understanding how some general cultural characteristics of Asian cultures 
impact their students' experience of American schooling. For example, 
Asian-American children may be confused by the informality that exists 
between teachers and students in America, and may feel considerable distress 
if attention is drawn to themselves in class. When developing curriculum and 
instruction that is culturally sensitive and methodologically adaptable to 
the needs of Asian-American students, teachers should: (1) familiarize 
themselves with the values and customs of their students' cultures; (2) learn 
a few words of their students' native languages; (5) base academic 
expectations on individual ability rather than on stereotypes; (4) use peer 
teaching; (5) utilize students' natural support system, including family, 
friends, and the community; and (6) encourage Asian parents to work with one 
another. (BC)
