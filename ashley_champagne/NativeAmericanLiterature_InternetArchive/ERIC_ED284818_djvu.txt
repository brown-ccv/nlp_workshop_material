ABSTRACT 

Designed to draw together major research, reference, 
background, and theoretical works focused on health issues of 
minority women of color in the United States, this bibliography was 
compiled to provide faculty in postsecondary educational institutions 
with references to materials which direct attention to health issues 
of significance to minority women. This bibliography suggests 
specific areas in which there is and is not an extant literature. It 
is not intended to be exhaustive or comprehensive in the range of 
topics or minority groups included. Rather, it is intended to be a 
stimulus to both teaching and research in areas which for too long 
have been ignored. The major focus off the references is on social 
science perspectives on minority women's health and on topics at the 
intersection of social science and clinical issues. A limited number 
of clinical references are included. The bibliography is organized 
into five major sections, one of comparative and reference works and 
the other four focused on specific groups of minority women: 
Afro-American, Asian American, Latina American, and Native American. 
Bach major section is organized into the following sis categories: 
General Background and Reference Works ; Historical Works ; Health 
Status; Behavior; Utilization and Policy; Reproduction; Sexuality; 
Maternal and Child Health; Mental Health; Drugs and Alcohol; and 
Providers off Health Car e • (Ml)

This endeavor truly represents the work of a community of 
scholars committed to making accessible the growing body of 
literature on the health of women of color in the United State 
We are excited to see how much work is underway which will aak 
this bibliography "outdated" very quickly* 



I. INTRODUCTION 



A, Purpose ; 

This bibliography is designed to draw together major 
research, reference, background and theoretical works focused on 
health issues of minority women of color in toe United states , 
It was compiled to provide faculty in postsecondary educational 
institutions with references to materials which direct attention 
to health issues of particular salience to minority women, 
Depending on the level of the institution, toe material is 
appropriate for assigning to students and/or for reading, lecture 
preparation and preliminary research; The bibliography includes 
materials appropriate for use in community colleges , 
universities, graduate programs and health professions schools 
including nursing, public health, health education and medicine. 

We also see toe bibliography as a resource for librarians 
and faculty who face toe difficult task of guiding students 
towards literature appropriate for use in writing term papers and 
K a I! n i ng in wandent research, We know from our own experience 
that few students persist and pursue topics about which faculty 
declare "there is no literature," This bibliography suggests 
specif ie^areas in which there is and is not an extant literature, 
it is not intended to be exhaustive or comprehensive in the range 
of topics or minority groups included. Rather it is intended to 
be a stimulus to both teaching and research in areas which for 
too long have been ignored. 

The major focus of the references is on social science 
perspectives on minority women's health and on topics at the 
intersection of social science and clinical issues. While some 
primarily clinical references are included, we have limited our 
efforts in this direction because of toe excellent on-going 
annotated bibliography "NURSING SCAN: WOMEN'S HEAWH" published 
by^toe Graduate Nursing Concentration in Women's Healto at toe 
School of Nursing, University of Illinois at Chicago, An order 
form for this publication is included in toe Resources Section at 
toe end of this volume. Scholars interested in the more 
biomedical aspects of healto issues which affect minority women 
will already rely on resources such as Index Hedious . Students 
who wish to pursue such topics are urged to seek the assistance 
of a medical school reference librarian, 

We strongly urge you to read toe rest of this introduction 
before attempting to use toe bibl iegraphy , while the location of 
some topics is obvious, the location of others is less so and 
supplemental references may be listed under ether categories, No 
bibliography is perfect and ours is no exception,

B. Description of lections asmd Categories 

The bibliography is ©rgaa~-±2ed into 5 major sections, one of 
comparative and reference worJoss and the other four focused on 
specific groups of minority wo»nen. The names we have used for 
each minority group are those ^recommended by the Thesaurus 
Prej set of the Haticiiil Council! for Research on Women and used in 
all the databases being devsloMped throughout the U , S , by the 
various Centers for Research oma, Women. (A list of these Centers 
can be found in the 'Resources lection at the end of this volume.) 



MAJOR SECTIONS OMF THE BIBLIOGRAPHY 

1. Comparative and Rifferen&e Works 

includes works Jihieh compare different minority group women 
with each other and/or wi«teh white women on various health 
issues. This section als^ includes basic background and 
reference works which pro^s/ide information on minority 
women's health eueh as pufalioatiens of the Public Health 
Service* We have attempted to cross-cite all references 
which noted speoifie minorrrity groups in the title . For 
example , an arfclels comparing Japanese and Hispanic women ' & 
mental health would be listed in terse sections of the 
bibliography s i) Comparative Overviews— Mental Health, 2) 
Asian American foasn—Menteal Health and 3) Latina American 
Women—Mental Health. Hov— /ever , many comparative articles do 
not list groups oenpared dsMn the title? all such articles ar% 
listed ONLY in the Comparative section. Thus, a scholar who 
is seriously interested ira locating literature on Latina 
American women's itntal hsalth would examine references not 
only in that section but ealso works in the Comparative 
Overviews - Mental Health section. We regret that we were 
unable to examine all of trine references cited here and thus 
were unable to cross-list all citations. 

2. Afro^Amerioan Weaen 1 s HaaX-Lth 

includes works en Black Amsaerican women of African, 
Carribean, Central and Soueath American and Middle Eastern 
ancestry. 

3. Asian American toen' s He am 1th 

includes works en women OCT Japanese, Chinese, Korean, 
Hawaiian, Southeast Asian,. Pilipina, Pacific Island, 
Malaysian, taotian, CaabcdKian, Thai and Vietnamese ancestry. 

4. Latina American Women 1 s He^alth 

includes works en women whrness heritage is Mexican, Puerto 




Rican, Cuban, Central American, Carribean, South American, 
and Spanish. 

5. Native American Women's Health 

includes works on women of any group of native peoples in 
the continental U.S. and Alaska « works on Hawaiian women 1 s 
health are found in the section on Asian American Women's 
Health where they traditionally have been included. 



MAJOR CATEGORIES IN EACH SECTION 



Within each major section, references are organized into the 
following six categories s 

!« General Backqound and Reference Works 

to understand: minority women 1 s health issues, one must 
understand the specific social , cultural , spiritual , and 
economic situations of the minority group in general . in 
this category we have variously included key classic works, 
largely on minority women's health but also background 
readings in which health issues are not necessarily central, 
In seme of these more general works, there are specific 
chapters or sections on health as well. General 
bibliographies and reference works for the minority group 
^F e ,f lso hm - £P*et£le reference works, such as 

bibliographies on mental health, are cited under the 
sub-category "Mental Health, Drugs and Alcohol," 

2. Historical Works 

This category includes historical works focused directly and 
indirectly en women's health Issues. Some are highly 
specific while otters are mere general. There are often 
very few references in this category as few historical works 
focused explicitly on minority women's health have been 
located except for studies and writings of nurses, doctors 
and other notable persons. These latter historical works 
are listed only under "Providers of Health Care." Users are 
strongly urged to examine references in the "General 
Background and Reference" categories to locate additional 
historical materials on health issues of the specific 
minority groups of interest . 

3 * Health S tatus, Behavior, utilization and Pol icy 

Thi f oroad category covers many inextricably related 
topics. Many works on minority women's health status, for 
example, eemnonly examine such issues in relation to 
soeio-cultural perspectives on health and illness behavior. 
Further, many works on utilization of health care systems 



relate this to sooio^oultXaE'a^ jirspeotives on heaslth, 
Illness and providers 1 b#^avC^ and n^c© health, *«are policy 
arguments based on these 4rkt%ffllations* The em^ergent 
literature on minority wo^an * i health in aging L&m similarly 
interconnected and thus ift^l^ hare. While tlL^-As category 
is broad, we believe that it ji necessarily so. 

4. Reproduction, Sexuality, ja at ^iial and Child Heal^^-th 

This category was develop^ST^ecause of the ekten^sive nm^a^i 
of related references on %aol^ slnerity group ancL , again, 
because of the interrelat^An^ss of the issues in^ 
polioy»making and practice* Styles include fertility, 
contraception, sexual attitudes and practices, pi^regnanoy, 
prenatal care, childbirth infant mortality* 

5* Mental Health » Drugs and AlcMoI - 

A wide range of topics reiAt$31o both adult and child 
mental health and psychoi^ffy m included in thirds category* 
Because toe majority of ^a Frances on drug axnd alcohol 
use and treatment fov minftFit^reup women are f Mound in the 
psychological literature, *r% Inolude these topic^s here, 

6. Providers of Health Care 

This category contains retey4^a§ on providers e=£ health 
care (e.g. nurses, physigianAfiidwives, traditiwonal and lay 
healers) relevant to the s^eftjfio minority group - ^ since 
many articles cover both hiet^rlwl and oontampe^rary 
information* we Include bsth in this section. Haany of toe 
references were written by £A«ylders for provide^arp and aim 
at improving the quality <&£ c^re of minority grewup members 
by taking cultural issues i^tic account. Because such works 
often contain considerable J^lpound infer&atiowi and 
references on health belief % mi practices of th— ^ specific 
groups 9 they may be quite useful. 

C. Sources Used and Excluded 

We have attempted to include -all major references in each 
category which we could locate £y Member, 1986. tfmmm explicitly 
excluded references to articles in wspapers, very oHbscure 
journals and unpublished papers * % number of works haave been 
published by minority group or^Mii^tlons, both in acwademia and 
in the community. We only include hire material whi«oh is 
currently available from those ^Q^liations. Scholaears 
interested in pursuing th« histo^i^sl emergence of aurach material 
are encouraged to contact the Clearinghouse on Women wof Color at 
Memphis state University (see Sactjois III, D) .

this bibliography, many witter f 3^5 psrspeot Ives wltMh which

RESEARCH CLEARINGHOUSE ON WOMEN OF COLOR AND SOUTHERN WOMEN 
CENTER FOR RESEARCH ON WOMEN 

The Center for Research an Woman &t Memphis State* 
University warn founded in 19S2 with an initial grant from the Ford 
Paundatlpn. Thr* ma jar obj^etiven of thm Ccinter ar© to conduct, 
promote, and advanc® rmnmmrzh on women of color in the* United 
States and Southern women* To that end we hav© worked closely 
with scholars in these developing fields am well am with faculty 
^nd students who need information on these groups of women, 

From the beginning, we at the Center have been aware of tho 
difficulties in locating tsocial ici@n€e and historical materialfi 
on these groups, The interdisciplinary nature of women's studies 
complicates the research process for many students, teachers and 
scholars. The research process 1 s often further complicated 
because materials on women of color and Southern women are 
frequently located in journals and publications which are not 
indexed in many of the major on-line data bases. To address the^a 
problems and to aid in locating and disseminating research on 
women of color and Southern Nomen, the Center for Research on 
Women developed the Research Clearinghouse* 

The Research Clearinghouse on Women of Color and Southern 
Women is designed to provide scholars, educators, students, policy 
makers, and the general public with up-to-date bibliographic and 
human resource information on research which focuses on these two 
groups of women This project was initially funded in 1984 by the 
U. S, Department of Education's Fund for the Improvement of 
Postsecondary Education (FJPSE)* 

The Clearinghouse is a computer-based information retrieval 
system. It includes three major filesi <1> a "human resource 
file" of individual researchers containing such information as 
institutional affiliation, areas of research interests, published 
and unpublished work, etc*f <2> an indexed file of full 
bibl ioqr aphic citations for works focusing on these groups of 
womeni and (3) a thesaurus type vocabulary of keyword descriptors 
to enhance the utility of the system* 

The Clearinghouse covers social science research produced 
since 197S in the fields of sociology, anthropology, economies, 
political science, history, women*s studies, ethnic studies, 
social psychology and education. The Center collects information 
on research -from a variety of sources including individual 
researchers, organizations (e.g., ethnic and women's studies 
centers), bibliographies, and so forth. The data base currently 
contains 2,500* up-to-date references to books, journal articles, 
chapters in books, unpublished works (including doctoral 
dissertations) and non-print materials-

Until now, thiarrf hufi been no centralised data basti of 
information on women of color and Southern women, Although 
placement on these groups has been incorporated into somii enisting 
data bases, they tend to bit limited in any of the following wayms 
they are restricted to information in certain disciplineis lack 
information about unpublished or in-prograss workf are organized 
so that information is not retrievable by race, class f gender and 
region? or contain limited references about research, and no 
information about researchers working in these areas* 

The Research Clearinghouse defines women of color to 
include Native American Indians! Afro-Americans (Went Indian 
Americans, African immigrants to the Uni ted States , etc.Jp Latinam 
(Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, Cubans, and other women of Latin 
origin) | Asian Am^ric^nw (Chinese*! Japanese, Korean, Thai, and 
other woman of Asian origin)! and Pacific Inlanders iPi lipinas, 
Hawaii ans, Tongans, ite,). Southern women include nomtn from 
Washington, DC and from the following atatesi Alabama, Arkansas, 
Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, 
North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Tanas, Virginia, and 
West Virginia* 

In addition to identifying citations from recently 
published books, leading journals, and many publications not 
routinely covered by other bibliographic services, a National 
Advisory Board of over twenty social scientists and historians 
monitor th^ new research in their fields and recommend entries for 
the data base. Each reference in the data base is indexed by up 
to eight keyword descriptors according to terms employed by the 
National Council for Research on Women's The Wom en' s Xnden t a 
women's studies thesaurus* This thesaurus was developed ai a 
collaborative project of women's research centers across the 
nation including our Centers 

In conjunction with the Research Clearinghouse, the 
Curriculum Integration Project focuses on disseminating 
information to Memphis and Mid South area college faculty as well 
as other faculty across the nation. This is accomplished with the 
monthly "Seminar on Women in the Curriculum" , which is held 
throughout the academic year. At the end of May, the project 
hosts the "Annual Workshop on Women in the Curriculum", a 3-day 
event which demonstrates the Research Clearinghouse data base; 
provides teachers, faculty and admi r m strators with the opportunity 
to revise courseCs) either being taught or created? and introduces 
innovative resources for classroom use (e.g., films, visual aids, 
etc.). The Clearinghouse has recently published the keynote 
addresses from the 1985 and 1986 Workshops, which are now 
available for purchase.
