Mens Grooming Advice5 months ago
"It's not always easy for a guy to buy himself make-up (largely due to archaic opinions of 'manliness'). If you want to know your skin tone, pop into a large department store and visit one of the beauty sections - you don't have to say you are wanting full make-up, just tell the (usually very attractive) make-up specialist that you need a concealer for under your eyes (too many late night parties) and she should find your perfect shade - giving the name and number of it in their range - and probably a sample to take away and test at home. If it sits well and gives you the result you want, you can always order the full products online if you are shy about buying them across the counter."

Hi ___I have to give an advice here. if you want to improve your complexion and the spots you need to use a prescription tretinoin( which is a vitamin A derivative) . of course different peels will do wonders but I mean even without the peels you'll see better complexion in about 4 months. The clay product won't improve the spots in the slighteset. Wear sunscreen and stay out of the sun . I promise you . you'll be amazed how good your skin looks.

I went to the drug store and tried some foundation & concealer samples but it looked like I was wearing make up. I don’t care if people see that I’m wearing make up but I don’t want that heavy cake look.

jezz hre we goagain with the dark circles from no sleep routine again!!!! When you people learn!!! Dark circles are GENETICS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Has nothing to dowith no sleep or tiredness!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If someone doesnt have dark circles at all normally then he or she will not all of the sudden get dark circles when they are tired!!!!!! Thats not how it works! People that get more pronounced dark circles when tired already have some degree of genetic dar circles! Somehow people like the idea of ooooh im so tired let e get my concealer!!!!!! WTF???? People are inventing stuff just so they can use certain stuff!!!!

"I can't believe that you made an 11 minute video where you put on 3 products that basically did everything wrong, and it's just because of men's fragile masculinity made you feel that you needed to put this video out there. Especially saying in the description ""do you have to be a girl or gay to wear makeup? NO"" All this video makes me think is that is there so much latent misogyny within society that you needed to try and teach straight men about makeup especially when there are professionals like Wayne Goss who is an amazing makeup artist and and actually knows what he is doing. I'm not criticising you in particular because you are clearly living your best life, Just pointing out how messed up society is that you would put what you said in the description. I also HATE the fact that people use specific ""makeup for men"" when makeup is makeup no matter what gender you are. I get you were sponsored but the way in which Altr is marketed is like ""MAKEUP FOR STRAIGHT WHITE MEN"" because I've seen the Altr shade range and its not POC friendly. They can state such rubbish like ""designed for male skin because of science"" which is completely misleading because you can find skincare and cosmetics for all skin types without dividing gender and more importantly SHADES. I just think that as a gay person you should be supporting a more diverse and equal target market than the obvious straight and white demographic for Altr."

"Women pride themselves in appearance. Men in strength/body. Wtf has happened with our priorities. Gosh go to the gym, work on your character, grow, read idk. That is what is supposed to make you feel confident. Instead you're gonna put foundation on to look like a prince... is it gonna come to the point men's faces are gonna 'dissolve' in the rain too? It's obviously just my opinion but ... idk I would never in the fucking world spend time on a man that finds confidence in foundation and highligher instead of actually worthy things. The 21st century my ass"

"I just started wearing makeup (only a few times a month), but I always hated how girls’ skin look when they remove makeup and bcuz of years of wearing it. They look oily and red and have some spots here and there compared to those who don’t wear makeup. So is there a way to avoid this? Do you think by wearing it max 2 times a week won’t ruin my skin?"
