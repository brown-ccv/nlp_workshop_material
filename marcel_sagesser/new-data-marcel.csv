I'm a man and use makeup regularly too (not kind of drag-y makeup but natural makeup).. glad to watch your makeup video. Hopefully in the future men won't be ashamed with wearing makeup :)
The beauty guru community was found wigless and in critical condition
I am a man and I found it normal for men to wear make-up. People should know that there's nothing wrong to it or might that associate to something.
I love the confidence you portray and don’t care about the stigma behind make up. Slay ______
James Charles Is Shaking __
Am i the only girl watch this ??? Hahaha..
"No, because us males wore makeup before females wore it same with tights and heels just females started to put it on and then everything changed"
Ughh i love men that takes such good cares about themself __
Relatable ________ I felt when you said dark circles and redness __________
"It's not always easy for a guy to buy himself make-up (largely due to archaic opinions of 'manliness'). If you want to know your skin tone, pop into a large department store and visit one of the beauty sections - you don't have to say you are wanting full make-up, just tell the (usually very attractive) make-up specialist that you need a concealer for under your eyes (too many late night parties) and she should find your perfect shade - giving the name and number of it in their range - and probably a sample to take away and test at home. If it sits well and gives you the result you want, you can always order the full products online if you are shy about buying them across the counter."
It's all good until you step outside and daylight reveals everything.
Wow you’re so hot & informative. Thank you king

I wouldn't mind trying this out but I never heard of this Altr brand and certainly not available in every country. Are there alternatives? Mac I have access to...
"...was hoping for some tips, but I'm not a white guy so my skin is too dark for the products T.T"
I really like your vidéos good luck
A before and after would be helpful.
You are super hot Without anything
"Men sometimes get insecure but I hope make up should only be applied as needed. Besides, theres a lot of skincare now a days what's the point."
"Protip; If you're worried about walking into a make up shop, don't be, they legit don't care. Men wearing make up isn't new to them."
best natural makeup tutorial I‘ve ever seen cause it is a real tutorial and not at all like just watching someone doing stuff unexplained to their face. pretty good for alle genders. probz.
You look very much the same from beginning and end of the video
What a cool video thanks for showing a helpful video keep up the great work
"beta ""males"" lmfao"

Lovveee you so much. This was useful
I needed this. Here in our country it is slowly becoming a trend where men use makeup to look good in public. I mean I hope there's no shame in that because we all want to look presentable. Keep it up mate
What are your thoughts on the Mac face and body?
I use make up only for parties!
YOU ARE BREATHTAKING EITHER WAY!
"Thank you a good video and I think it's funny , before no guy straight or even gay would use makeup , now every one is . I'm curious about this product you are using , why this one and can you get in the US ? I have the same thing as you having these darker colors around the eyes , even though I take care and sleep enough so I'm always looking for a concealer , which is sometimes the only thing I use ."
That doesn't seem to be your instagram anymore.
been thinking about this for a while now. def gonna try it out
"What a handsome base you are to start off with before the makeup, after the makeup, well ....hotsy totsy!!!"
Omgah U r so handsome dude
Honey yes i'm living for you
I dont even wear make up but I'm a fan already
I took my spouse to sephora so i can look for a concealer. My spouse was like what do you need that for i was like to cover up darkness and spouse was like “is there one for the opposite gender?”
You are too handsome to be made up.
U r __
I would wear it if it was so subtle that no one would notice....
So good and helpful __

"Oh man, every single time that I try to do a “natural” makeup, I end up looking like a clown, for videos or pictures, I look ok, but in real life, face to face, no no haha"
I can't understand why a natural beautiful man needs all this.
What the name of all makeup?? Thx for answer
That is not your index finger.
"Bought Altr BB Cream and Face Fix and beyond happy with the results! Thank you Altr and Carl for promoting such a wonderful brand! Side note, what’s the song playing in the background?????"
People that thinks that makeup is only for women are the weakest race of this universe and those weak minds shall perish
Looking good
I like how Carl take cares of his skin. And giving advices for make up routine for men. Where wearing a makeup especially for men is like a taboo. It inspired me to create my first ever tutorial makeup for men in under 5 mins
"watched until he held up the first product and say ""this is for any guy"" but the only shades are for white skin lol. I've learned something today"

I saw you on instagram. You are really handsome!
Love you video's so much
I just go for a full beat
that change is dramatic!
"Either way, you're hot"
Hi ___I have to give an advice here. if you want to improve your complexion and the spots you need to use a prescription tretinoin( which is a vitamin A derivative) . of course different peels will do wonders but I mean even without the peels you'll see better complexion in about 4 months. The clay product won't improve the spots in the slighteset. Wear sunscreen and stay out of the sun . I promise you . you'll be amazed how good your skin looks.
I think you look very cute with no make up but I came here for the tutorial. You look great either way. ____
I’m a guy and wear primer then foundation on top. Just light and not too much. Not embarrassed by it. Job well done.
Great video! ____
You're so hot . Before and after . You have a natural attractive beauty
"I don't wear make up but I'm getting married in a couple of weeks and just wanna look my best. Of course I want it to look natural if I do so I'd skip the bronzer as he said. But yeah, is using something to just make your dark circles disappear really so wrong? What do you think people?"
Can i have the product names . Please ____
Men doesnt need a makeup!
Wait so your shade is the deepest they have?!?!? Clearly isn’t meant for men of color smh
Amazing tips. I will try to follow this steps and hope I get a good result. Thanks once again for this great tips.
wearing natural makeup as a guy shouldn't be seen as gay. And men should be comfortable I personally don't find a need to wear makeup because I naturaly have great looking skin at least from what I have been told. But I'll be down to give it a try sometime.
"Hi Carl!!!! Love love LOVED this video!! I also did 10 different videos so far for Male Complexion that I do for me on a daily basis, for my models, and my photo shoots!!! I'm glad that I'm not the only one that has started doing this and including male tutorials for men!! Check them out on my channel____"
I am a man I use make up to hide my red scars.
I find it funny how it is a stigma for men to wear make up considering men in the Victorian era wore tons of make up and
I am black man will this help me
"Nice, but you don't need it"
Can you use normal woman's makeup? How do you select the right colour? Feel a bit odd going into a shop to ask.. Confidence and all that.. Thank you
I have the altr for men products used in this video and they work great.
Totally hot
Guys love you!!!
Looks a bit glossy. Is this just because he is sweating or is this always how it ends up?
I’ve been having problem with my face being red. I’m getting embarrassed by how red I look. Will these products be opaque enough to cover the really red areas or are they kind of sheer and translucent? I went to the drug store and tried some foundation & concealer samples but it looked like I was wearing make up. I don’t care if people see that I’m wearing make up but I don’t want that heavy cake look.
this is amazing
"Now... for the rest of us, how about a 'EASY Beginners Tutorial' without a chiseled, perfectly symmetrical, greek statue as a base?"

"Did anyone knows how to cover pimples,acne,blackhead etc"

Finally something new and different. Men who take care of themselves are the most beautiful / male of all of them and I hope one day everyone will realize that and tells the norm to go to hell____ Make-up is for everyone!
Don’t like the way he specifically thinks that you have to be gay or that all gay men wear make up but okay I guess

________________Very nice
Okay I have a question...I am seriously thinking about makeup to cover some redness from Rosacea on my face...How do I find the correct cover up for my natural look color wise?
Hi
Lol wtf
"Let's be clear; celebrity men wear makeup all the time. Nothing wrong with wearing makeup and honestly, for me, I prefer when someone does because it means they take themselves seriously."
jezz hre we goagain with the dark circles from no sleep routine again!!!! When you people learn!!! Dark circles are GENETICS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Has nothing to dowith no sleep or tiredness!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If someone doesnt have dark circles at all normally then he or she will not all of the sudden get dark circles when they are tired!!!!!! Thats not how it works! People that get more pronounced dark circles when tired already have some degree of genetic dar circles! Somehow people like the idea of ooooh im so tired let e get my concealer!!!!!! WTF???? People are inventing stuff just so they can use certain stuff!!!!
BETAAAAAAAAAAAAA SOYYYYYYYYYYYYYY GAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY BOYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"If your uncomfortable with your natural imperfections and cover them un naturally you are behaving surface while operating on the level of vanity .. Just so we're clear on the idea behind ""beauty products "" ."
"I can't believe that you made an 11 minute video where you put on 3 products that basically did everything wrong, and it's just because of men's fragile masculinity made you feel that you needed to put this video out there. Especially saying in the description ""do you have to be a girl or gay to wear makeup? NO"" All this video makes me think is that is there so much latent misogyny within society that you needed to try and teach straight men about makeup especially when there are professionals like Wayne Goss who is an amazing makeup artist and and actually knows what he is doing. I'm not criticising you in particular because you are clearly living your best life, Just pointing out how messed up society is that you would put what you said in the description. I also HATE the fact that people use specific ""makeup for men"" when makeup is makeup no matter what gender you are. I get you were sponsored but the way in which Altr is marketed is like ""MAKEUP FOR STRAIGHT WHITE MEN"" because I've seen the Altr shade range and its not POC friendly. They can state such rubbish like ""designed for male skin because of science"" which is completely misleading because you can find skincare and cosmetics for all skin types without dividing gender and more importantly SHADES. I just think that as a gay person you should be supporting a more diverse and equal target market than the obvious straight and white demographic for Altr."
__
"This is what men natural make should looks like.. James Charles, Manny Mua, etc is just piece of weird unnatural make up.."
I like when guys (who went gay its ok if gay people wear makeup tho) actually put effort into there routine. Men's natural makeup is ok
"OMG please stop stretching your skin. Every time you do it I feel physical pain. You have such a pretty face, please, don't cause wrinkles before their time."
I'm so down for this!! Such a shame that most men are too afraid to wear make up it would be a big boost for their confidence
"Hi Carl, can you give me some advice as to how I would go about finding the right colour foundation or BB cream for my skin? I would like to start using something like this but unsure what colours etc to go for and I find the majority of assistants at makeup counters are girls and Id feel better talking to another fella about this."
Are you gay then since you wear makeup? Or do straight guys actually wear makeup? Never heard of this before ??
Awesome video!
Cute __ ____
Google bronze
never ever use your finger :'( micro exfoliation !!!!
"Am I the only one considering any makeup on men as not natural? The combination of tattoos all over that guy and the makeup he is putting on his face makes me confused. Sorry guys, I probably keep myself makeupless. :-))"
Gorgeous
"Imma be honest, that's pretty gay"
"Women pride themselves in appearance. Men in strength/body. Wtf has happened with our priorities. Gosh go to the gym, work on your character, grow, read idk. That is what is supposed to make you feel confident. Instead you're gonna put foundation on to look like a prince... is it gonna come to the point men's faces are gonna 'dissolve' in the rain too? It's obviously just my opinion but ... idk I would never in the fucking world spend time on a man that finds confidence in foundation and highligher instead of actually worthy things. The 21st century my ass"
I have only ever tried eye concealer because apparently I don't like sleep. I have considered using natural mens' makeup however.
You are so successful
"I just started wearing makeup (only a few times a month), but I always hated how girls’ skin look when they remove makeup and bcuz of years of wearing it. They look oily and red and have some spots here and there compared to those who don’t wear makeup. So is there a way to avoid this? Do you think by wearing it max 2 times a week won’t ruin my skin?"
_______
am i the only one who loves my under eye dark circle?
You slayed it.
I think you were even hotter before the makeup! I thought the dark circles were sexy
Make a video on shave or wax pubic hair
"No Need for Make up Guys.... Hot Rag then Massage/Facial Yoga then Cold Rag. Lastly, Organic Argan Oil."
Do a I need to be gay for use make up ?

It's like a ''straight male'' wearing a skirt and high heels and a dress btw you can def see that this dude is wearing makeup
"Carl: you DONT need any make up, you're handsome as you are (I would do you) please stop fagging it up!... the only makeup you really need is your beard, kid ______"
Do u get monthly periods aswell??dude ur a man not a woman..this is wrong on so many levels
"Men's Makeup & Natural, don't belong in the same statement..."
if you are a model or movie star and you need to look good for reason that's fine we are not judging but guys really you don't need to go that far for normal men this is disgusting if men wear makeup like a girl please be men and let the girl be a girl if you think now you look attractive to a women you are totally wrong ..
Make up is not for girls only because makeup enhance the face to be look good and natural
I guess males don’t like being men any more...
You mean gay men natural makeup
